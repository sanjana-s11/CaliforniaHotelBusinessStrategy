Miller was a prominent fruit grower, packer and dehydrator in the early 1900s. He was also one of the first to make a commercial business of marketing dehydrated fruit. Among Miller's claims to fame is that he was the first provider to the U.S. Military of dehydrated foods. Known as K-rations during WW I and MREs today, Miller was cited by the military for ""feeding the troops during WW I"". (1) Miller and his wife were, like many prominent citizens of the community, anxious to furnish their home lavishly. The home is reputed to be the first in Healdsburg with two bathrooms, with indoor plumbing upstairs and downstairs.The noted horticulturist, Luther Burbank, was a good friend and assisted in the design and development of the original landscape at the front of the home, some of which remains today. The large cedar, cypress, and redwood heritage trees were planted by Burbank over 100 years ago. The lush grounds have been accented with rose bushes and numerous flowering shrubs. The same archaeological report from Sonoma State University indicates that some of the first plantings of some of Burbank's new species were planted on the Miller property. Sadly, the location and botanical name of the plants were never recorded. It is unknown if they remain on the property today.The home remained in the Miller family until the late 1930s and was a private residence until the early 1980s when it became a Bed and Breakfast. The inn has undergone extensive restoration over the years. Beautiful hand-silk screened period wall and ceiling papers accent the spacious common areas and some guest rooms. The papers are produced by Bradbury & Bradbury of Benicia, CA and are based on designs of William Morris, a prominent textile designer of the mid- to late 1800s.The formal, yet welcoming rooms include a spacious parlor with fireplace-the perfect place to enjoy the morning paper or a board game on a quiet afternoon. The spacious dining room that seats up to 14 showcases original wainscoting and built-in china cabinet and bench. The large antique table is where guests dine on Calderwood's signature gourmet breakfasts. The covered front porch with its antique wicker furniture and lacquered floor beckons you to enjoy the lush grounds, review the activities of your day or curl up with a good book. The porch is often used by local wineries who frequently co-host our complimentary evening wine hour. All nine guest rooms have private baths.

In 2002, threatened by re-development, this historical landmark was acquired by Menachem Treivush and has since undergone a multi-million dollar renovation. By carefully preserving historically-scrutinizing details, incorporating the technology of today, and dedicating careful attention to detail, Mr. Treivush has rapidly built up The Charlie into the unique establishment that it is today! Since re-opening to the public in 2008, The Charlie has become known as The Hidden Gem of the legendary West Hollywood!",1,0,0,5.0,4.5,4.0,4.5,83.0,17.0,8.0,185,369

A relaxed attitude, with the diverse array of breakfast items and cookies from tea being left out late, so people don’t feel like they have to race to make a deadline to eat.

Where the scenic Russian River meets the crashing Pacific, the landmark Jenner Inn is being reborn. Its new owners are painstakingly restoring the historic inn, room by charming room, transforming the hostelry into a destination worthy of its breathtaking setting. Charlie Coyne, along with wife Katie and his cousins Marty and Tom, are the principals of Dublin Square, the family-owned company that is behind the renovation and rebirth of the Jenner Inn. The Coyne family has demonstrated its ability to breathe new life into historic properties and create superior hospitality experiences. A native Northern Californian, Charlie was practicing law in the 1980’s in San Rafael when his brothers brought him on board to join them in resurrecting the foundering Delta King stern-wheeler that used to ferry passengers across the San Francisco Bay. Under the Coyne family’s leadership, the Delta King is now a thriving hotel and restaurant operation moored on the Sacramento River in Old Sacramento. Tracing its roots to 1904, the Jenner Inn began life as a lumber mill, and played a critical role in the rebuilding of San Francisco after the 1906 earthquake and fire. The mill closed in 1914 when the town consisted of some fifty buildings, seven of which are today part of the Jenner Inn. After the original hotel on the site was destroyed by fire in 1948, the current main structure was built—a one-of-a-kind redwood building with galleon windows, wheel beamed ceilings, and solid oak floors—its design reminiscent of a sailing ship (not surprising since the craftsmen who constructed it were Swedish boat-builders). The building is believed to have been designed by an associate of famed architect Julia Morgan. Today the Jenner Inn is a collection of 21 rooms and free-standing cottages scattered throughout the village, many of them dating to the era of the town’s founding. The Coyne family’s vision for the property is to maintain the inn’s legendary charm while updating its decor, furnishings and amenities. Most important, the inn aims to meld seamlessly with its setting, capitalizing on the surrounding natural scenery, quaint village atmosphere, and proximity to Sonoma Wine Country. Because each room is unique, prices will vary, but the goal is to offer a romantic destination emphasizing the natural beauty and activities of west Sonoma, including kayaking, whale and seal watching, abalone diving, fishing, bicycling and the world class Sonoma wine and food bounty. Several rooms are being designated as pet friendly. Renovation of the inn is occurring in stages, one building at a time, with the hotel continuing to operate throughout the process. Guests may choose from any of eight lodging types, ranging from the cottages with waterfront, meadow or grotto views; to the Jenner House’s comfortable creek side rooms and suites; to private studios. Many have kitchens, most have water views, some have private decks, and all offer comfort, privacy, and charm. In coming months the Jenner Inn’s dining room will include a full bar, and restaurant, beginning with full made-to-order breakfast for guests. The Coyne family’s vision for the Jenner Inn grows from Charlie’s experience as general manager of the Delta King Hotel and Restaurant for twenty-two years, as well as involvement in other hospitality projects in Northern California. An avid abalone diver, Charlie happened upon the Jenner Inn while returning from a diving trip. Dublin Square LLC purchased the Jenner Inn in February 2016, opening the door to another adventurous chapter for the Coyne family. Says Charlie Coyne, “ Our attraction to the Jenner Inn mirrors what motivated our purchase of the Delta King. We will be guardians of an incomparable asset with significance that transcends our ownership. We view the Jenner Inn as a treasure of historic proportion and natural beauty that cannot be duplicated. Our emphasis will be to accent the inherent attractions of the Jenner Inn and west Sonoma County. We were elated at the opportunity to acquire such a unique property located so close to the Bay Area. “",0,0,1,4.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,,,,243,169

Guests travel from across the United States and around the world visit this guest ranch. They enjoy the fact that it is a ""real"" working ranch, and are fascinated with its century old history. Many guests emphasize the importance of the ""family"" atmosphere; meeting and visiting with Rankin family members is routine as they all live right on the ranch...4th, 5th and 6th generations. ""Western hospitality"" is part of your package! The favorite activity at the ranch has always been the horseback riding. We have both adult and children's rides (riding starts at age six) which explore our meadows, Walker's Basin Creek, and mountain ridges overlooking our beautiful little valley. The guided trail rides are about one hour long and all levels of riders are welcome. Parents and grandparents especially appreciate the supervised children's program for ages 4-11 during Spring Break and the summer months. They enjoy arts and crafts, hikes, and visits to the animal farm. Other ranch activities include swimming, hiking, fishing (trout stocked pond), shuffleboard, ping pong, recreation room and planned evening activities.

All Redwoods In Yosemite cabins are inside Yosemite National Park about 4.5 miles inside the south gate on Highway 41/The Wawona Road in the charming town of Wawona. Thriving and intimate, Wawona is a hidden gem. Though less famous than Yosemite Valley, Wawona boasts its own nearby travel-worthy destinations. Wawona is the closest community to the Mariposa Grove of Giant Sequoias. This magnificent grove is the largest within Yosemite, and contains more than 500 mature sequoias, including the Grizzly Giant, the California Tunnel Tree, and many more. There are also many beautiful sights that will be just a relaxing walk away from your Yosemite cabin rental. Chilnualna Falls is the second-highest vertical drop waterfall in Yosemite. The trail to the top leaves right from the town of Wawona with beautiful cascades and scenic vistas along the way. Plus, you’ll find the best natural water slide in the park at the historic Wawona Swinging Bridge. Up the street, the Pioneer History Center provides a glimpse into Yosemite’s history. There are stagecoach rides, horseback rides, and barn dances in the summer season. Meander between historic buildings and chat with living history docents. Speaking with lively characters like working blacksmiths brings the pioneer days to life. There is a reason the local Miwok tribe named this place Pallachun in their language (a good place to stay). The south fork of Merced River sings through open meadows filled with wildlife. This designated Wild and Scenic River is Wawona’s heart. In the spring, wildflowers blanket the roadsides and peek from around every bend. You can’t miss the carpets of purple lupine, and you’ll delight to see the flashes of color from poppies or other tiny wildflowers. Galen Clark, Yosemite National Park’s first guardian, settled here in Wawona in 1855, and built a lodge to welcome travelers on their way to see Yosemite Valley’s famous granite cliffs. Some things have changed in the intervening years. But Clark’s reputation for hospitality continues to echo through this corner of Yosemite. And the convenience of the location for Yosemite visitors continues to be unmatched. Experience some of the legendary hospitality of the region for yourself when you rent a cabin from The Redwoods In Yosemite. Choose from more than 120 unique Yosemite National Park cabins. It’s easy to find a perfect match for you and your group. Options range from cozy one-bedroom cabins to spacious luxury homes. So whether you’re looking for a romantic getaway or an expansive gathering space, you’ll find something at The Redwoods In Yosemite. You can even search for pet-friendly cabins in Yosemite to accommodate your furry family members. What does The Redwoods in Yosemite mean to you? - a word By Jon Finney (WPMI dba The Redwoods In Yosemite Board of Directors President 2012-2016) ""Over generations, countless visitors have driven down a meandering Chilnualna Falls Road for the first time in search of an answer to that question. To those that made that journey, we all were that person at one point in our lives and the uniqueness of that initial memory, and those that ensued, is as unique as the Redwoods. It is a constant appreciation of that dichotomy of commonality and difference that makes the Redwoods so special. Whether you can no longer count the number of visits that you’ve made to the Redwoods or you just discovered it, it should come as no surprise that places like the Redwoods are rare. In many ways, its timeless continuance is an improbable outcome for a small establishment nestled within one of the Seven Wonders of the World. Were it not for decades of enduring care from its early founders and every generation that followed, the fate of the Redwoods might read quite differently. Acknowledging all the individual contributions that helped deliver the Redwoods to where it is today would be a daunting task, to say the least. Then again, that debt of gratitude may already be paid in full. For anyone that has spent time at the Redwoods has already received something meaningful in return, memories. To the individual for which these memories belong, they are likely priceless. Generously, several individuals have shared herein some of their thoughts on the Redwoods for all of us to enjoy. Perhaps that will compel you to share your memories as well. It’s not difficult, you just have to ask yourself, what does the Redwoods mean to you?""",1,0,1,4.5,4.5,3.5,4.0,,,,53,

We built the wood-fired oven in the garden, a pond, Jasmine Cottage, Gray's Retreat and the Barn Loft. I was a professional artist for many years, then commuted from the Schoolhouse to U.C. Berkeley to become a landscape architect. Twenty-five years ago I converted the carriage house to Jasmine Cottage. It was the very first cottage open to visitors as a Point Reyes vacation rental. Point Reyes area lodging at the time was just a few traditional bed and breakfasts in Inverness with a couple small motels on that side of Tomales Bay. Inverness was the place for holidays then; Point Reyes was a working cow town. Nobody thought visitors would want to stay in the little town of Pt. Reyes. Because I offered a secluded garden cottage with an invitation to bring the children and the family dog, Jasmine Cottage was instantly popular as a romantic get-away and a family retreat. Sixteen years ago I designed and built the barn that houses Gray's Retreat and the Barn Loft, intended as places for our extended family to visit and as part-time vacation rentals.",0,0,0,5.0,4.5,4.0,4.0,,,,29,
