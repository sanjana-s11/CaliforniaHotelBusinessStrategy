Teri B,1,,2021-11-30,NONE,2021-11-30,5,My GoTo Hotel in Solvang,"I love the Hotel Corque.  There is no other way to put it.  It is a great location within Solvang, quiet yet close to restaurants and attractions within the town.  The rooms are well appointed and very clean.  The bed is wonderfully comfortable too!  I've stayed here at least 10 times (I think I started coming here just after it opened) and it has not gotten run down with age.  The staff is always friendly and extremely helpful.  It is home away from home for me.","The rooms are quiet, even those facing Alisol Rd.",5.0,5.0,,5.0,,,,,,,0

The room was very clean and had a great layout. The bathroom had two separate sink areas with mirrors with Built-in LED Lights and even had a wall mounted make-up mirror.

blugini,21,"Orlando, Florida",2021-11-30,FRIENDS,2021-11-01,1,A couple minutes to Vacate the room,"My first impression of this hotel was a good one. The rooms are spacious and pillow comfy.  My review would have been very different if not for the customer/guest services issue I encountered  

Sometimes when we're on vacation, work calls as it did for me early November 1, 2021. I started working at 5am to help the team with an issue. Meanwhile my travel companion got up and went out to do the normal vacation things, like breakfast and shopping. I was in no way having fun or sleeping in. I was working from 5am - about 10:45-11am. The work issue resolved, I called the front desk explaining and asking for accomodations or a little later check out. I was told it was too bad I had to work, but they could not give me a late checkout. I was told I'd be given ""a couple minutes to gather your things and vacate the room"".  Seriously?!? I told the man in guest services that I'd do my best. 

So on top of an already wasted vacation day, I was now packing all our things, rushing to get dressed and get out or Vacate was the word he used. I know I left all my toiletries and some makeup in the room as I walked out in sock feet through the pool exit. Just to Vacate this hotel. 

If you're a normal person who occasionally has work pop up or any kind of unforseen occurrence, don't stay here. Oh and I ended up finishing getting dressed and doing my makeup/hair in the hotel parking lot. But at least I vacated the room.

wkrik,314,"Carlsbad, California",2021-07-31,NONE,2021-07-22,4,Nice ADA Room ... Get 2-for-1 Tastings,"TIP: Solvang has lots of wine tasting rooms. Hotel guests can get 2-for-1 tastings. If you arrive before check-in and your room is not ready, try to get the list from reception. We killed time by doing some tastings, then learned of the list after check-in. I  was disappointed that the same person at check-in didn't tell me when I told her we were going tasting until the room was ready. That's $50 I won't get back. 
     Hotel was running at half capacity due to lack of staffing, so there was plenty of free self-parking, hotel wasn't crowded, internet was slow. Masks wearing was 50/50. Hotel appeared clean and felt safe.
     We needed a bathtub, and they had an ADA (disability) room (#237) available. WOW, nice big bathroom, bathtub had 3 nozzles (and a rubber duck!), spacious queen room, reading lights in headboard, and motion censored nightlight. Beds may have been lowered, but very comfortable!  Only complaint was no bathroom counter and a small table so a wheelchair could fit. No ice on 2nd floor, so had to go to 3rd floor for ice and vending machines.

We've stayed in Solvang before, usually at the Hadsten House, the Corque's sister property. But we decided to splurge here this time, and it didn't disappoint.

When we entered the room, there was a Happy Anniversary card waiting for us with snacks. The people were always nice, including people always there to open the door when we arrived. We had a room with a balcony overlooking the pool, which was a pleasant place to read with coffee in the morning.

Because of COVID, there was no housekeeping, which was difficult for a few days' stay. There's also no free breakfast or room service. But getting breakfast in the bakeries nearby is half the fun of going to Solvang.

Definitely have to shout out Adriana, the front office supervisor. What a gem! 

The special thing about Hotel Corque is they go out of their way to make the guests feel welcome. There's always a little sweet treat in the room when I arrive and they have a great tasting deal with several wineries/vineyards in the area. The location is central and parking is free. It's just a great place to get away for the weekend. I'm from LA and it's nice to have a place I return to again and again, and they always remember us.

Our room was light and airy with a great bathroom and extra fresh towels, there is a pool and jacuzzi outback, but seemed to be totally unused.
  Overall Solvang is a sad little tourist town that closes its doors at 9 o'clock, the Hotel is surrounded by lots of souvenir shops, but hard to find an adult beverage spot that’s fun.

This time, my husband and I happened to be in the area, for an overnight trip and thought we should give the Corque a try since it was just a last minute thing.

Nice property, although we did have a cleanliness issue with our room. Resolved by the Housekeeping Dept. 

Only red flag was the immaturity of the front desk team. While in the lobby, they were complaining about a guest they just checked in. The front office manager, I think his name was Joseph, he checked us in, seemed to be the leader of that conversation. No bueno!!",,,,,,,,,,,,1

This time we knew that there was no food or beverage service. Do not understand why they put a $100 hold on credit card for incidentals when no incidentals are offered.

That was annoying but what was terrifying was a power outage in the morning.  We could not call for assistance because the phone system did not work. Bathroom was pitch dark.  We were on the 3rd floor; my husband has balance issues due to previous surgeries and has difficulty with stairs.  We were at a total loss as how to negotiate our way out.  The hotel hallway had a few dim safety lights and that was all.  

After about an hour and a half, I helped my husband down the stairs and then made several trips to get our belongings.  I was never so happy to leave a hotel in my life.

This hotel either has no back up safety plan for power outages or failed to implement them.

The hotel was full, but we never felt that it was crowded. Temperatures  were checked at the door and we were given a wristband to avoid multiple checks as we went in and out during the day. Keep in mind a hotel stay is different during the pandemic:  There is no daily maid service, no room service and no vending machines. Ice is still available. Understandable and no problem for us.
We stayed in room 308, a Treetop Room. It was a very nice room and had a great bathroom with double vanities on opposite sides of the room, which we loved.
My only complaint is that the room was billed as having ""French doors opening to a breezy balcony"". There were indeed french doors and it was nice and breezy...but there is no balcony. I have attached a photo. When we stay here again, we will request one of the rooms with real balconies, overlooking the pool.
One of the reasons I booked this hotel is it's pool and little fabric enclosed cabanas. I was so looking forward to a swim after a day of wine tasting. However, there were so many kids in the pool all day, playing games and being kids that there was no way an unrelated adult would be comfortable trying to swim among them. Maybe management would consider an adult hour in the late afternoon or early evening? We spoke to several others who were hoping for some post wine pool time.

It was close to many many restaurants in Solvang of all kinds and varieties and many within walking distance or a 3 min. drive.  The grounds were beautiful - a boutique hotel - homey but large - 4 flours if I recall with elevators of course.  With a beautifully decorated lobby, they had coffee and different teas available on the first and second floors with plenty of seating, privacy if you wanted it  with many pleasant visiting areas.  The lobby had an inviting fireplace and comfortable chairs to just enjoy relaxing and having coffee, etc.

The rooms were very spacious, comfortable beds, and the bathroom was large with  two separate sinks and counters, plenty large for a couple to have their own private sink area.  The step in shower was great or if you preferred a bathtub, you could have had a room with that instead, same price.  They even had their own restaurant, dinner only, with a  very inviting menu. 

The price was surprisingly reasonable and we would stay there again in a heartbeat.  Don't know if they are that reasonable year round but this hotel is a real find if you are staying in Solvang.  WE LOVED IT.

Problem is the noise.. if you are not on the top floor, expect stomping above you .. it’s not a concrete building so boom boom boom . 
In my case starting early in the morning and at least two hours. 
So if you stay here get the top -3rd- floor. Or stay elsewhere.
Plus the HVAC makes some loud noises as well overnight .

Mon R.,1,,2019-12-31,NONE,2020-01-09,1,Horrible Experience at Hotel Corque owned by Chumash Resorts.,"Recently, I was to arrive for my stay at Hotel Corque. I received a very disturbing call. Vanessa Sallas, left me a voice message and told me that we were banned from Hotel Corque and gave us an option to make reservations at the Chumash Casino, which was very confusing because if we were banned why would we be allowed to make reservations at a sister property.

I immediately called the hotel and asked to speak with their Manager. I was transferred to Scott Gold. I told Scott how upset I was at receiving this message. I told him that in the many years of my life, we have never been banned from anything. I was very upset and concerned that someone with authority would place us on some ban list without giving us a valid reason.

I informed Scott Gold that my husband and I had just visited their hotel to celebrate our wedding anniversary, in June of this year and did not experience any problems. No one called us and told us we were banned when we stayed this year at Hotel Corque in June, so why now? I further informed Scott that I still had his greeting card that he gave us, wishing us a happy anniversary. I was very confused and upset at why I would be receiving a message that we were banned just 2 days before our arrival.

Scott stated that he would rectify this by reinstating my reservations and lifting the ban. I continued to ask Scott Gold who banned us and why, because this was very important. He kept saying he was looking through his notes but never answered my question.

I asked Scott for a room upgrade for putting me through all this grief and still not telling me who and why we were placed on a ban. He said he was not able to do it since it was a popular holiday weekend and since he may not be there, I could ask Catilina Dorethy the Manager on duty.

I have been a frequent hotel guest of this property well before it was called Hotel Corque , which was previously named the Royal Scandinavian Inn.

I arrived at Hotel Corque on Saturday, December 28th. I informed Catilina, the same facts relayed to Scott Gold. Catilina stated that she would check their reservations to see if there were rooms available for an upgrade. She then informed me that there was none. I asked Catilinia if she knew who had banned us and why. She responded, Andrew Martinez. Catilina told me that the prior manager did not write why we were banned, he just wrote down that we were banned from Hotel Corque. I expressed to Catilina Dorethy that this was an unacceptable explanation. It is very concerning that one manager had the power to write one sentence to discriminate against me.

If what Hotel Corque was saying is so compelling of a circumstance, to have triggered a ban, then why did Scott reinstate us so quickly and still not give us any valid reason for taking these actions against us, other than it being discrimination?

I then asked to be checked in and Catilina Dorethy responded by saying, we only have one room remaining and it still needs to be cleaned, so you will have to wait for us to call you. She rudely informed me that she was leaving for the day, rushed for time. She had several Hotel employees standing around her, making me feel extremely uncomfortable because the conversation was supposed to be private but there was no privacy at all. Other hotel guests could literally hear every word of our conversation which was humiliating to me.

It was near check in time and the rooms still had not been cleaned. Since I was made to wait for the rooms to be cleaned, I began to check the Hotel Corque website online to see what the current room availability was. I found 3 available rooms. I went back and showed Catilina, she then stated there was no availability even after showing her the availability on my phone. Catilina said she was not going to provide an upgrade. First she said there were no rooms available then when I showed her the availability she changed her answer, which led me to question if there was no availability at all or was there no availability to me. Catalina further stated that Scott Gold told her, it was our fault that the prior manager Andrew Martinez, banned us from the hotel and they were not going to do anything further.

At this point I felt like I had wasted my time and money coming here.

I then reached out to Scott Gold and left him a voicemail, thinking this important matter would trigger an immediate response from him. Scott never returned my call or email. I then went back in to the lobby to tell supervisor Thalia that I was not going to stay and that we were upset for Hotel Corque wasting our time, especially because we had booked it in early December with a confirmation. Thalia said she will take care of it.

After being notified that I was banned from Hotel Corque then reinstated, traveling over 200 miles, wasting $100 in gas, scrambling to find another hotel to stay in outside of Solvang, at the dead of night, paying the highest price because of the holiday, being severely stressed because my husband’s birthday plans were ruined which triggered his health to decline.

It’s now been two weeks and unfortunately the hotel still has not responded to my valid concerns.

I ask of the Chumash Casino Resort properties, to do what’s right, for putting me through all this frustration caused by Hotel Corque and its staff. An apology would be a good start.",,,1.0,,2.0,,,,,,,3

BkellyBear,3,"Los Angeles, California",2020-01-31,NONE,2020-01-07,5,Simply AMAZING stay in Solvang,"Just returned from a family trip to Solvang and had the most amazing experience at the Hotel Corque.

The check-in was seamless.  The woman at the front desk was warm and helped us get  settled immediately.  Because our drive up was a little longer than we planned, she was remarkably sensitive to the fact that we had a dinner reservation at the hotel restaurant
immediately following our check in.

We were very pleased with the rooms.  They were clean and airy.  The views from the third floor window and balcony were lovely.  While we didn't plan on visiting the pool, we certainly could have.  

The highlight of the trip was eating at the Chef's table at Root 246.  Chief Frank was wonderful.  His team guided us through the menu and helped us realize that the best option was EVERYTHING.  Literally.  We got the tasting menu and spent a delightful 2 and a half hours with him and his team.  They walked us through each course and  helped me find some yummy wine to accompany the food.

After dinner, we felt we needed to be rolled back to the hotel room we were so stuffed with yummy goodness.  Chef Frank wasn't done--he took us on a tour of the kitchen and helped us understand all of the complexities that occur behind the scenes.

The hotel was perfectly located in town and we were a quick walk from everything we wanted to do.  There was wonderful shopping and eats nearby including a super bakery and candy store.

Had we wanted to do wine tasting, we could have spent an entire day sampling local wines without walking more than a few blocks.  As we were with the kids, we had other plans but certainly I'd return to this charming town in a heartbeat for a couple of days again.

We stayed in two different rooms and they were both nice, especially the beds.  At first we stayed on the first floor near the lobby and we found that to be noisy, however, when we moved to the second floor towards the back of the hotel, it was quiet and got some nice rest.  I was a little disappointed that we could not get a hot breakfast but that was solved easily by going to one of the local, very nice, restaurants that were close by.

Every room we've stayed in has been clean and comfortable. The showers are good, provided products are top shelf, and the beds are comfortable. Decent selection of TV channels, but not having my wife's favorite channel (TLC) available almost cost them a point. WiFi is acceptably fast. The hidden gem is the restaurant next door where their room service meals come from. Their fried chicken dinner is outstanding, as is the Impossible Burger. Downsides? The free coffee is not for us, but that's a matter of taste. They also really should clean the carpet on the stairwell or change to some kind of hard flooring.

Adventure awaits,24,,2019-08-31,NONE,2019-09-03,2,Not exactly restful,"The pillows were fairly hard and high.  When I asked for an alternative down pillow or one not so high and hard, I was told there was a smaller pillow in one of the drawers.  The problem was I had already found the ""smaller"" pillow.. It was smaller in length.. but still hard and high.  There offered no other alternative and I was there for three nights.  

We actually chose this location to use the pool.  The only opportunity arose on our final day.   When we went to the  pool, there was a large group there with extremely loud music and a few suitcases of beer.   Ok, we know it is not a private pool just for us.  That said, the group did not appear to be guests in the hotel, using bark from the garden beds to prop open the gate, rather than use a card key .  They did this for not only the pool gate but also the gate to the parking lot.  Again, it seemed that they were not guests at the hotel.  We left the pool and stopped into the lobby to speak to one of the staff at the front desk, she did not seem concerned or to care in the least.  So the security at this hotel seems kind of sketchy at best.  

For a four diamond hotel, I think I expected a bit more in comfort and security... and concern.  I could not and would not recommend this facility especially for the price.  I wrote an email describing the above a few weeks ago, but there has been no response.

fishfish24,1,"Carlisle, Pennsylvania",2019-08-31,FAMILY,2019-08-13,4,Nice touches - consider the side of the house ,"Pretty hotel inside and out with sweet touches like table games, flavored water, and coffee out on the floors. Comfortable room with large bathroom. The balconies are nice for enjoying the weather. We were on the back and had a beautiful view of the mountains but also parking lot so most times there was a delivery truck making noise. The front side of hotel may be a nicer idea to minimize the truck issues. I do recommend the hotel. The town is a fun little stop - but stores close by about 6 so mostly only restaurants open later. Even ice cream stores close up early. ",,,,,,,,ScottG3337,General Manager,2019-08-13,"fishfish24,

I am delighted that you enjoyed our property amenities and got to take advantage of the perfect weather and beautiful views from your personal patio! Our location does allow for a short walk from the action, but also just out of the main area for some quite peacefulness. I do apologize for the noise from the deliveries. Next time you visit, make sure to spend the later hours of the day and night at our restaurant, Root246.

Daniel M,14,"Porto, Portugal",2019-08-31,NONE,2019-08-11,1,"False advertisement regarding best rate guarantee, rude and evasive customer service hung up on me","Hotel Corque's website indicates the Hotel has a ""Best Rate guaranteed"", which goes on to mention ""Our rates are the lowest available anywhere - guaranteed"" and ""Our booking engine has the best offers, so no need to shop around"". I suggest you go ahead and check for yourself.

Well, good luck having that honored.

I was looking to book 2 Queen Studio rooms at Hotel Corque for one night from August 18th to 19th. Hotels.com quoted a total of $303.08, whereas Hotel Corque's website quoted $314.12.

I called the Hotel to have information on how to have the lower price honored, since it is not explained on the website. Not only was I quoted a much higher price for the reservation over the phone ($398+taxes), I was told by the attendant that Hotel Corque has no such guarantee, in spite of what the website says. 

As I protested, the attendant transfered me to a supervisor, Melanie, who confirmed that regardless of what the website said, no such guarantee existed and none would be given. As I raised the fact that the website was therefore falsely advertising a best price guarantee and questioned her lame attempts at justifying this, Melanie became combative, was extremely rude and hung up in my face.

I have printouts of the quotes on Hotels.com and on hotel Corque's website, and I encourage the relevant authorities as well as Tripadvisor to investigate this; such practices and customer service should be utterly unworthy of a Certificate of Excellence.",,,,,,,,,,,,23

We were greeted by a very friendly desk clerk who took all the time needed to make our stay comfortable. She gave us a map of facility as well as a map of local restaurants and she told us which were her favorite places to dine. Our room was very well appointed and clean. There is plenty of closet space, dresser space and a very spacious bathroom with a stall shower.

Ed B,97,"Pasadena, California",2019-07-31,COUPLES,2019-07-22,5,Best base for Solvang,"Stayed here after the great property reviews for a weekend cycling trip in Santa Ynez Valley. Wanted to stay at a hotel and this seemed like a good middle of the road nice place to stay. Location is close to perfect. You are literally within 4-5 blocks of most of the town's offerings and everything else is a quick drive/cycle away. 

The hotel has been nicely refurbished now that's its part of the Chumash Casino group.  We aren't gamblers, but did take note of the shuttle that was available. Check in was quick and efficient (not warm & fuzzy - but professional and friendly. Maybe people mess with them a lot?). Room was fantastic. 

Loved:
- Powerful (really) A/C in the rooms I hesitate to say what our room chilled down to - but frosty would be close. 
- Water pressure in bathroom. The tub is generous and is the fastest filling tub I've ever encountered. The standing glass shower was nice (a little snug) and easy to use.
- Pool. Not big, or small - just right. Depending on the hour you got all kinds of people. 
- Towels. They were really nice. In the rooms, at the pool - I'm just saying. Really nice towels. 
- Bed.  It was firm. Loved it. They give you enough pillows to sleep a squadron. 
- Cork46 does the room service. Yum! They don't overcharge for the service either. I appreciated that.

Cons:
- Nice flavored water ran low in the early afternoon. But that was mostly from people filling up their giant water bottles. I gave sideye. They filled em up anyway.
- Never saw the bellhop(s). Waited in the port cochere for 10 minutes. No big deal. Maybe they were guarding against the water thieves.

Do yourself a favor., For this pricepoint we did really well. Checked out the fancier places and decided I liked it here better.",Hallways can get a bit loud on 1st floor. Got really quiet around 11pm thankfully.,,4.0,5.0,5.0,,,ScottG3337,General Manager,2019-07-24,"Meerkat92101,

Go791442,6,,2019-04-30,FAMILY,2019-04-30,2,"Getting locked in the bathroom is not of concern, or not unusual","My sister and I stayed here last week (April 2019).  Check-in was generally neutral - not particularly welcoming.  Room was ok, but not what I'd consider updated.  Worn carpet, wall behind beds shows where previous headboard was (not painted recently),  but after my sister got locked in the bathroom, we noticed it appeared that someone had previously tried to pry it open (a painted-over gouge in the door).  So when they claim the place is a ""premier boutique hotel"" - uhhh, I guess that can mean a lot of things?  Fortunately I was in the room when she got locked in the bathroom by a defective latch.  Called front desk - they didn't seem too concerned, and didn't sound surprised, but sent a repairman to the room.  He came in with a screw driver in hand - he knew exactly what had happened, did not apologize, but told us she must have shut the door too hard? Seriously?  So we bought a screwdriver (in case it happened again), and tried to recreate the situation - shutting door forcefully, etc.  Couldn't do it.  So not sure what is going on there, but on checkout, I waited patiently for the young clerk to ask us about our stay - of course she didn't.  So I questioned her whether she'd ever heard of anyone getting locked in the bathrooms.  She quietly said ""a few times"".  WHAT????  So they knew, didn't care, didn't apologize. In fact, she was quite offended that I questioned her on that. What if I hadn't been there, or a child had been locked in and terrified?  Oops - guess that's ok with this hotel.  Never going back, disgusted by the lack of concern for guests.  Two stars because it wasn't horrible, reasonably priced - but I guess you truly get what you pay for.  Just bring a screwdriver, and if the slot in the screw on the room side of the bathroom door is horizontal, turn it to vertical to allow the bathroom door to open!  I'm sure there're a few other peculiarities of the place, but I'll let others discover those.",,3.0,1.0,,,,3.0,,,,,4
Del,2,"Buena Park, California",2019-04-30,BUSINESS,2019-04-08,5,Hotel Staff and Management Top Notch,"I have recently travelled to Solvang on a few occasions on business. In my last 2 visits, I choose Hotel Corque to stay overnight.

On the first stay, I choose this location because of its proximity to my meeting location, photos and reviews. From the start of arrival, my experience with the hotel staff was much more than that. It was everything personal. The welcoming and warm vibes from Yasbel and management were above par. The staff were extremely busy but extremely patient and detailed with myself and the interactions I observed with other guest. 

During this stay, I ran into some dissatisfaction with service received by the associated restaurant next door. Instead of talking about those specifics, it’s more important that I share how the hotel handled it: with professionalism, dignity, and integrity insuring the matter was shared with staff to improve my overall experience. Yasbel was a key part of this, apologetic and sharing what is expected of each member of staff. Yasbel asked that we try another visit to Hotel Corque should we visit Solvang again and in doing so, she would insure that our stay was improved.

Approximately 1 week later, I returned for another business trip. To my surprise and without no advanced notice to her, Yasbel remember me and made a point to follow up with results from my previous concerns. This included taking an interest in my meeting itinerary. More specifically, Yasbel provided a morning wake up call the morning of my meeting and insured I had enough time to eat breakfast before my big day.

This is truly an exceptional business practice rarely seen to insure guest have a more enjoyable experience.

In addition to this, during both stays, Yasbel offered many suggestions on places to visit and activities. There is no doubt that I returned to Hotel Corque because of the service provided by Yasbel.

The hotel management overall takes a lot of pride in the quality of service they provide to their customers. And customer feedback is clearly taken very serious.",,,,,,,,ScottG3337,General Manager,2019-04-15,"Harbingerhorizon,

Comfortable beds and bedding. Sound proofing is great. Spacious Santa Ynes room. Dual sinks were a plus. Great water pressure. Free infused water downstairs and coffee and Tea upstairs. I was going to remove a star for the shuttle but I will just report this here.I don't appreciate your shuttle bus drivers attitude. one driver saw us at the stop and ignored us and sped by. That is a problem I hope no one has to go though. Its rude for them to stare at you as they drive by the stop in front of the casino. Teach them customer service please.

We were there for a girls trip and had several rooms booked for an event. We got a really good group rate as well, thank you!

The only complaint we have (and I mean most of the rooms booked for about 20 women) : we could not check in a moment before 4pm!!  That is a VERY late check in time to begin with, and for the rooms to not be ready at this time was very frustrating. In fact, at 4pm we decided to get ready in their small 1st floor lobby bathroom! Suitcases open, makeup out while other guests were walking in and out. We only stayed 1 night for a dinner event, so to have to wait till after 4pm to get into our rooms was disappointing.

edieann,896,"Denver, Colorado",2019-01-31,COUPLES,2019-01-17,5,Wish we could have stayed more than one night!," A boutique hotel at extraordinarily reasonable prices. 

We had a spacious, quiet room with excellent lighting (one of my biggest criticisms of a hotel room is its lousy lighting). Electronic charging stations were built into lamp bases. It was a very nicely appointed space with chairs, desk, and luggage rack, although only one.

The washroom and shower were great: spacious with two sinks and plenty of counter space, nice toiletries, plush towels and it was sparkling clean. 

Our room had a king sized bed that was very comfy with excellent bed covers and a selection of pillows.

Our room felt luxurious as did the common spaces of the hotel itself. All the staff we encountered were very friendly and helpful.

There is an affiliated restaurant just down the street but breakfast is not included in the cost of your room.

We hope to stay here again😊

The hotel is labeled as a 3 or 3 and a half stars and I don’t understand why; it is in my opinion a very solid 4 or 4+ stars. 
My review is based on several stays. The hotel and the rooms are very clean. Furniture is comfortable, style is contemporary. Staff is courteous, location is excellent. 
What I appreciate the most about hotel Corque is that I’ve been staying there for years and although not much has changed in terms of look and feel, the hotel is very well kept. Furniture is seems to be constantly re-conditioned, wallpaper, paint always refreshed, bathrooms always seem in top condition. In other words, it appears to me that management of this hotel doesn’t seem to wait until everything is run down and ride what they have until it shows its age to start a complete renovation effort. This to me is what I appreciate about hotel Corque and gives me confidence in keeping it as my first choice when I visit Solvang. ",,,,,,,,ScottG3337,General Manager,2019-01-14,"spacecali,

The scenic drive up along the coast line into the endless fields and ranch farms to eventually ending up in the most adorable Danish village. Hotel Corque is very elegant and modern in comparison to a few other hotels in the area. Everything is within walking distance and the town is bursting with tourist photo opportunities. The pool side views from the 3rd floor room balcony are breathtaking. The cozy white robes make you feel as though you are relaxed and waiting for a spa day experience. The sleigh style king bed was stunning, we only wished our very own bedroom was that beautiful. The cozy fireplace in the lobby upon arrival and the beautiful front desks and employees are very personable and warm welcoming. The Chumash Casino is just under 10 minutes away and Hotel Corque has a classy shuttle service which comes several times during the hour for pickups and drop offs continually 24 hours a day.

Thank you very much for taking the time to leave your comments about your recent experience at Hotel Corque. Your comments are very valuable to us. I am certainly sorry to learn that you feel disappointed by the condition of the carpet in your guestroom. We do have some areas of our property that are showing a bit of age, but certainly our Housekeeping Team does keep our hotel very clean. Its our excellent service that we are also known for. We are currently planning, and working in real time with a designer, preparing for a renovation! Our property will become a shiny new property that I know you will love! From floor to ceiling, all of our rooms, suites, and public areas will be redone. 
I would like to connect with you to give you more information about our exciting project. If you would kindly let me know how to contact you, I will reach out to you! Scott.gold@hotelcorque.com.
Again, thank you for your time, and look forward to connecting soon!",59
nedarosa,198,"Los Angeles, California",2018-12-31,FRIENDS,2018-12-11,4,Wonderful! ,"This hotel is so much nicer than online pics - such a pleasant surprise!  Friendly front desk staff, great location, free parking, free hot tea and coffee all day and night on each floor.

The rooms are quiet with comfy beds, nice decor, quiet and updated bathrooms.  Adjoining rooms are also offered which was perfect for us.

Two complaints:  1 - not pet friendly which doesn’t make sense for such a pet friendly town and 2 - restaurant / happy hour place not open everyday.  For a town that basically shuts down at 6-7 PM, it would have been nice to have a place to hang out, have drinks, eat, etc.

Overall, a nice hotel, great location and well priced. ",,,,,,,,ScottG3337,General Manager,2018-12-12,"nedarosa,

Thank you for your review! I am delighted that we met your expectations on your recent experience with us. Our team works very hard to ensure the service we provide is memorable. I am happy to know that we were able to provide the adjoining rooms you needed. Thanks for mentioning the complimentary amenities we happily provide...our guests love them!
I am sorry that we do not currently accommodate 4 legged friends. We love them too, but just not ready to have them stay over. Also, please remember that although Root246 is closed on Monday's we do serve Room Service 7 days a week. Private dining can be a fun and relaxing meal! If you want to get out for a great meal on a Monday, we always recommend Willows steakhouse at the Chumash Casino. There are complementary shuttles that leave our property twice an hour. Trust me, Willows is a treat!

Our reservation that we had a confirmation for was fouled up and they tried to charge us again after it was already paid but our travel friend was told they didn’t even have Friday night of her reservation and sent her to another hotel but told her she had to come back Saturday! She preferred Hadsten House where there was a warm greeting with fresh chocolate chip cookies and breakfast included. We had none of that. The hotel appears understaffed with less than friendly reception, no room safes and the second floor coffee area was out of coffee on Saturday morning! The room only had one oversized chair and a desk chair. Would not stay again. Better value elsewhere. ",,,,,,,,ScottG3337,General Manager,2018-12-03,"jneiln,

Solvang is such a cute little town. Being Danish, it was fun to see the Danish heritage all over the city. The hotel itself is really well laid out and designed.

I usually stay here and always have enjoyed it but this time I felt like I just had to write a review. I met some friends for a couple days away and a PCPA performance at the Solvang Festival Theater (perfect location with a short walk). The rooms were clean and comfortable as always and I have always appreciated the bathrooms with their double sinks, nice showers and granite. This time however I feel like the service was really excellent (I don't usually give 5/5 ratings lightly). The desk staff honored my request for rooms near each other which I know is harder in smaller hotels) and were friendly and helpful answering questions. The final feather in their cap came this morning as 3 of us were sitting in an alcove in our hall drinking our coffee (the public area near and above the reception desk was a little to ""lively"" for first thing in the morning). A maintenance worker came out of a stairway and noticed one of us was sitting on the floor. Moments later he came down the hall carrying a chair for my friend. Well done!

We were greeted by the efficient, friendly concierge team in the impressive entrance hallway. Little hospitable touches were everywhere: complimentary hot drinks, fruited iced water, board games and lounge seating.

Our room was large with a huge comfortable king bed and luxurious fine linen bedding. Our balcony overlooked the pool and mountains. 
The bathroom was large and well appointed with walk in shower and tub.

The hotel is in Solvang, so we were able to have a walk round the town, which is worth a look being mainly a mixture between Danish-based tourist shops and winery outlets.

James W,12,,2017-12-31,NONE,2018-08-06,5,Our favorite Solvang hotel,"We'd first stayed at Hotel Corque a few years ago, around Christmas, and loved it. We booked a return trip for Christmas 2017. Sadly, the wildfires devastated the area around Solvang. While we were there, Solvang had become the hub for the many firefighters dealing with the blazes. Quite a few stayed at the Corque.

The rooms are comfortable. We don't always have the best luck with hotel beds, but Corque's were well above average. And their pillows were a cut above. My wife now covets those pillows. She frequently wakes with headaches, but she had none with Corque's pillows and beds.

We've never stayed in a ski lodge, but that's the vibe I imagine. At Christmastime, their decorations are seasonally appropriate, and sitting around by the fire in the lobby or playing a game of checkers or chess at the stations on various lobby floors made hanging around on a cold night fun. There's a restaurant abutting the hotel, with fantastic food in both the restaurant and the accompanying bar.  You're also within easy walking distance of Solvang's east side shops and restaurants, a little off the main strip.

The Corque's staff has always been friendly and accommodating. We love staying there.",,,,,,,,Scott G,General Manager,2018-08-09,"James W,

Pros:
- Walking distance to downtown area - we walked to all meals, etc.
- The pool. The pool and pool area is really nice. I was able to lounge comfortably and watch my kids swim. In the evening, the kids went back in the pool and I was able to watch them from the hot tub!
- Miguel, the hotel manager the day we checked in. He was really great with my kids, very helpful and friendly. Definitely made the stay more enjoyable and memorable.
- The room: The beds were really comfortable and our room was well laid out. Had a great balcony where we could lay out our wet bathing suits, etc.

Cons:
- The rooms and common areas (i.e the decor and carpet) are showing their age. Especially the carpet. If your definition of luxury is new and modern, you will need to adjust your expectations for this hotel.

The hotel is located a few blocks from the Santa Ynez Mission and in a great location to access all there is to do in Solvang. The rooms and the bathrooms are spacious and were kept very clean. Our group included two children (4 year-old and 7-year old) as well as four adults. Check in is at 4:00 pm so when I arrived at 1:30 pm I knew our rooms would not be ready, what I wasn't prepared for was how attentive and helpful all the staff was, particularly Miguel who I believe is the manager. Everybody was very welcoming from the staff opening and holding the door to us, to the courtesy phone call informing us that our rooms were ready. During our stay we needed access to a microwave and we were completely surprised by how quickly someone brought it up to our room at no extra charge. During our stay we also encountered problems with the TV in one of the rooms and after a phone call to the front desk, a technician was at our door within three minutes. The kids loved the pool which had some pool toys and beach balls to use, again for no extra fee. What compelled me to write this review was the overall attentiveness and hospitality that the hotel staff offered. Everyone that we met was always smiling and welcoming to my family, which has not always been the case at some other four and five star hotels that we've stayed at. I believe that Miguel put it best when he told me that something that he wanted his staff to understand was that the beds and lobbies don't make a hotel great it is how customers feel when they walk in that makes the difference. For me that epitomizes the customer service that Hotel Corque offers.

The hotel owned by a casino, where you can take shuttle to there. I personally would prefer stay this hotel and drive to casino if you need to.

It is literally a block away from the main street to walk down.  The entry of the Hotel is warm and inviting with a nice fireplace burning day and night.  We enjoyed the backgammon game in the lobby where there was other games with quaint and cozy seating options.  The second floor had good coffee, tea and hot chocolate packs. Our room faced the street (without a view) but we only stayed 1 night and the room was clean and comfy.  The beds were very comfortable.  I always bring my own pillow as the pillows always to seem too large.  The staff had a genuine friendliness to them and was extremely helpful in maps, location of wineries, dinner and printing out backgammon rules. There is a gym you can use next door for $12.00 a day.

Everything you want is within walking distance: The Mission, restaurants, shops, bakeries, bars and wine tastings. We didn't have to drive anywhere unless we were leaving the area.

We asked for dinner recommendations when we checked in and they said the place right next door, Root 246. I assumed it would be stuffy but the service and food were incredible. I believe they can also bring room service to the hotel.

The room itself was lovely, with a view of the pool and the mountains. We also had a balcony. It was kept pretty clean and the bathroom was huge. The pool area was great, with lots of cabanas and spots to lay out. It was pretty cold when we were there so we stuck to the hot tub. Both the pool and hot tub had wheelchair access.

The lobby was very cozy, with a fireplace and games, and lots of wood accents. I enjoyed the fruit-infused water, and the coffee or hot water for tea or cocoa on the second floor.

The double queen room was spacious. We had one with view. Bathroom was huge with double vanity. Room was exceptionally clean. Some furniture, especially the headboards were a little beaten up but the cleanliness made up for minor cosmetic glitches. 

The only thing that we did not enjoy--the restaurant is bad, but this is not a review for Root246 which is owned by the Hotel. Guest might want to refrain from ordering their breakfast from the restaurant. They goofed up our order and absolutely refused to send extra toast for my 9 year old who did not want any eggs. You only get 1 side of toast with 1 dish of eggs--no extras. What was worse was when they sent us the wrong order of eggs (with ham when we asked for veggies), the staff took away only the eggs and replaced them--by the time the proper order came, 20 minutes later, the toasts were cold but no replacement toasts were sent. Yes, the restaurant gave a 50% discount but when I am spending over 300 $ a night for the room, who cares about 50% discount--I'd rather have a room service that goes above and beyond to please the customer. And all of this after we dined at the same restaurant the previous night.

Carpeting in the rooms is getting old and dated.  Carpeting in hallways needs to be replaced.  Remotes on TVs are not working properly, we couldn't activate the sleep timer or ""closed captions.""   Slight amount of mildew in the shower stall, evidence of the property's aging gracefully.

All of the above complaints are very minor --- would have given FIVE STARS if they put a little fresh carpets & decor, and had there been a place to eat breakfast or lunch on the premises.

Hotel's restaurant (Root 246) is not open until 4pm.   This is not acceptable for a hotel restaurant.

Fortunately, the ""Santa Ynez Cafe"" is only 3/4 mile away (corner of Alamo Pintado & Hwy 246).
We ate TWO very good breakfasts at Santa Ynez cafe, avoiding the local tourist trap restaurants in Solvang.",,4.0,4.0,,,5.0,,,,,,147

Bruce H,47,,2017-10-31,COUPLES,2017-10-23,4,"Great Hotel, but not all rooms have views","First let me say that this is one of the best, and most expensive, hotels in Solvang.  We stay in this town 1-2 times a year as a base for wine tasting and other events and have tried several hotels in the area. The staff was friendly and helpful. The rooms were first class (big and luxurious bathrooms). We did not eat at the restaurant, but did have a few drinks at the nice bar. Salvang is a family friendly destination, so if you are looking for quite adult time at most pools in town, you may be out of luck.  My only concern was the view did not match the room description. The room description states “Enjoy views of the quaint Danish town of Solvang with rooms located on all floors of the hotel”.  Our room had a view of the bush outside the windows and the parking lot beyond. When I brought up the discrepancy to the front desk manager, he seemed prepared for this with a courteous but seemingly common response about how the parking lot wraps around the building. He did offer to help find a better room on our next visit..  I may stay at the hotel again, but may verify the location/floor of the room on prior to future stays.",,,4.0,5.0,,5.0,,,,,,38

I planned a little surprise that required a some assistance from the hotel.  Prior to arrival, I shipped up the necessary supplies and emailed instructions. Everyone was very accommodating and helpful.  After checking in, I snook away to the Front Desk to confirm the logistics one last time. The GM happened to be there and assured me that he and a few other managers were going to take care of this themselves. 
Upon returning from dinner, we entered the room that was dimly lit LED candles that led us to a rose petal covered path to the bed. On the bed were more candles and pinecones in the shape of a heart, with presents in the middle. The air was filled the romantic r&b music and the faint scent of roses and lavender - coming from the half drawn oversized bath tub. The bathroom was sprinkled with pink and red rose petals in and out of the half drawn bubble bath with champagne chilling by the tub. Also, to my surprise, there was delicious chocolate covered strawberries and cake waiting for us.  My expectations were blown away as my plan and design for the night, came to life, perfectly.
The team at the Hotel Corque really did an amazing job - going way above and beyond standard hospitality protocol.  I felt that they really cared and wanted the night to be extra special and it was.

It is located in one corner of the village, which means you can save time by walking to nearly all of the often-visited areas in the village, and can easily return to the hotel when you want to.  The hotel provides a free shuttle twice an hour to/from the Chumash Casino Resort about 4 miles away.  The resort has a pretty good international dinner buffet there ($25 per person) starting at 4pm.  There’s also a Mobil gas station there, if you’re looking to fill up the tank.

I was blessed with being able to get early check-in for my stay.  The room was quiet and nicely appointed.  It included a refrigerator, which came in handy because it was a very warm day.  The air conditioner was strong.  A very large TV was provided, as were 2 robes.  The layout of the bathroom was very nice.  But probably the best thing about the room was it was very clean, the cleanest one we’ve stayed in according to my wife, who’s very, very picky about cleanliness.

When my wife who made the reservations called she told the desk clerk she wanted a room with a balcony view.

Anyhow the place is very nicely decorated, the Ca. King bed we had was very comfortable, and the floor seemed VERY solid, so it probably didn't transfer a lot of noise to the floor below. 
When we tried to put items in the refrigerator we noticed the bottom latch to the door covering the fridge was popped out because the wood screw pulled out and the latch was blocking the fridge door from opening. I called the desk and told the girl who answered the problem. She said she would send ""Maintenance"" up right away. We left for 3 hours to go out. Got back, still not fixed, called again...girl says ""Oh sorry about that, didn't get to tell them, and they've left for the day""...but we can MOVE you to another room."" Fine...we get to the other room down the hall, put some wine in the fridge, it doesn't work at all!

We check the back wall and the fridge is not even PLUGGED IN! Does it take a wizard to make sure all appliances are PLUGGED IN? The mainetenance crew (Joe is terrific, love the guy) does a great job if the admin people would just get on the stick at some point and TELL them. Then we find that the fridge is so noisy that no wonder someone unplugged it.
That's my story and I'm stick'en to it.

Ken,137,,2017-06-30,COUPLES,2017-06-25,4,Probably the best hotel in Solvang,"My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Corque for one night in June and we were pleasantly surprised. When searching for hotels in Solvang, most hotels looked a bit shabby but this hotel looked the most modern and stylish and did not disappoint. 

Our room was decently sized with all the amenities required and the bathroom was nicely appointed as well. The room had a filter coffee maker but coffee and water was also available by the elevators which was a nice touch. There is also a small pool area outside with plenty of sunbeds, umbrellas and towels. 

The location is perfect for sightseeing in Solvang and most restaurants and bakeries are easily reached by foot although the quality and authenticity of the food is very questionable. The only exception is Olsen’s bakery which had a few authentic Danish pastries along with many Americanized versions. 

There is a free shuttle bus to the Chumash Indian Casino every 30 minutes which was much appreciated. The buffet restaurant at the casino offers the best meal in town and is also reasonably priced. 

Check in and check out went smoothly and all in all we had a nice stay. The only negative is the fact that there is no breakfast restaurant available although they were able to organize breakfast in the room (for a charge).",,,4.0,4.0,,4.0,,,,,,207

The front desk staff were the real highlight of our stay: very efficient, friendly, and knowledgeable about the hotel, they set the tone for a wonderful visit.

Our room was clean, quiet, and had plenty of light, and the bathroom was large and beautiful, with a separate bath and shower and nice toiletries. The room could use a few improvements during the next planned upgrade of the hotel. First, the mattress of the bed felt a little clunky: hard at the edges and softer in the middle, but we got a good night's sleep nevertheless. Second, some of the finishes in the room could be selected to wear better over time. The large leather headboard was starting to peel and crack near the pillows (likely because of the dry weather), and the walls above the desk were getting scuffed up by the lamp. 

The hotel's pool area was really pleasant and quite empty, especially in the morning, and a gym was available in the adjacent building for a $12 fee (per guest, per day).

We used the hotel as a home base for the Santa Barbara Wine Country Half Marathon. It was conveniently located close to the finish line; we were able to wake up, get coffee, catch a shuttle, run, shower, and get back to the post-race expo with plenty of time to spare!",Our top floor room was very quiet,,5.0,,,4.0,5.0,,,,,55

Staff and facilities are top notch. 

Corque is a block from downtown Solvang. WARNING: Solvang, AKA ""Little Denmark,"" has at least one delightful bakery, a candy store, a cozy European style restaurant, and a wine shop in every block. Temptation abounds!

My wife liked the lavender farm in nearby Ballard and she especially loved the Fess Parker winery north of Los Olivos. She loved Davy Crockett as a girl and, if the real Davy had owned a winery, he couldn't have done better than this.

This hotel had been recommended to us by the bride and groom, who reserved a wing of rooms for their guests. We were very happy with our room. Compared to most of the other inns in Solvang, the Hotel Corque is very modern, clean, well-maintained and more upscale, with lovely decor and extremely comfortable beds. We had a balcony room which I especially appreciated because I like to be able to open the window/doors and get some fresh air into any hotel room we stay in.  It would be greatly appreciated though if the hotel would offer a complimentary breakfast like so many of the other Solvang inns do. Both mornings of our stay we walked across the street and into the village and ate at  cafes we found, but it would have been more relaxing to not have to venture out of the hotel so early in the day in search of sustenance.  The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful with any questions we had, and I liked that on the second floor they provide an area where hot coffee and tea are available 24 hours for all guests.  If you want a  more upscale hotel than most you can find in Solvang, I think the Hotel Corque fits the bill.  We will definitely plan to stay here again if we are in the area.

It is easy to walk to all the shops and little restaurants in town. But we were there for mostly wine tasting in the area.  So I prefer to stay in a hotel in the area that offers a free, great breakfast.  I did not like that I had to go outside the hotel for a good breakfast before we went wine tasting in the late morning. Also I think the hotel is a little expensive for what it is.

I did research a few hotels in the area ahead of time and thought Corque would be a good choice.  Upon arrival, they did not have a King room available (only a King Suite at $230), so we opted for a double Queen room, which was perfectly adequate for our needs.  Our room (with balcony) overlooked the pool and mountains, and thankfully, there was no pool noise so early in the season (mid-March).

Room:  Clean, comfortable, with very little wear and tear; fridge and coffee available.
Bathroom:  Very nice, spacious, modern design, clean.

Pros:  Hotel is in town but a few steps away from the main hub, so the crowds thin out just before reaching the hotel lot.  Most rooms are set back from the street, so there is little street noise to worry about (at least in a room facing the mountains).  Complementary tea/coffee on 2nd floor.

Con:  Just minor things.  A broken handle on the drape pulls.  Also, there is no partition between the adjoining balconies (just a railing), so there is no sense of privacy when enjoying the balcony.  Check-in staff was not overly friendly; just OK.

Root 246 Restaurant:  The hotel’s restaurant is excellent.  Had a wonderful meal here!  Perhaps pricey for a family or regular night out, but it’s a great place for a special occasion dinner.  Lighting and atmosphere are amazing—warm, classy, sophisticated.

Enjoyed our stay.  Corque will be our hotel of choice whenever we’re in the area.",,,,,,,,,,,,58

Then we discovered a light out in the room - not a big deal, but it was fixed by a staff member within 60 seconds of a phone call to the front desk.  But the real problem came when we made up the sleeper sofa for our teenager, only to find the bed completely broken inside.  A rollaway bed for our 6 foot teen was all the hotel could offer that night.  BUT!

A challenging ride with an elevation gain of 5000 feet. The Danish capital of America, Solvang is a cute little town in the heart of the Santa Ynez Valley with rolling hills, scenic wineries and who knew - an Ostrich farm with dozens of ostriches running around! I did a double take and had to pull over, when I first spotted what appeared to be ostriches standing in a farmers field on Route 246! 

The best part of our stay was undoubtedly the lovely swimming pool with the relaxing hot tub. It was perfect after a long day in the saddle for our cycling race and we met the most fascinating people - most notable was our fellow racer and rocket scientist friend who was a consultant for SpaceX and had worked with Elon Musk. We learned all about delivering payloads into orbit. Oh the people you meet in hot tubs in California. Fascinating conversations with so many great people. The complimentary bath robes were a nice touch too.
The Hotel also put on a  nice BBQ after the race where bands played and later a DJ played songs like ""California Girls"" in the parking lot, which was filled with cycling vendors.  

The bad was the fact that service was usually without a smile and although their complimentary coffee and tea station was normally available around the clock, for the duration of the race it was off limits. It was taken down completely even well after the race was over and early in the morning and late at night when a quick ""cuppa"" would have been rather nice.

The ugly was the fact we were charged triple the normal room rate, due to the popularity of the race. For two nights we paid C$1000 and that did not even include breakfast. This seems a little steep for a ground floor room overlooking the parking lot!

That being said our room was pleasant enough with two Queen size beds and the ground floor location close to the front door, made getting our bikes into our room easier.
The bathroom was spotless and had a large bath tub and a spacious glass walled shower with two separate sink areas - one of each of us.

I've been to Solvang plenty times over as a kid growing up but he had never been so I figured a great place for him to check out the architecture, food and history and a great place for me to wine and dine it up right?! The hotel was conveniently located (not hard to find at all) and even though they have valet parking it's very easy to park right in the front parking lot of the hotel so that's what we chose to do. When we arrived our room was not ready yet and we were advised it would be about 10 minutes. We had just  grabbed some food so they offered to have us eat out by the pool.
Their pool is very nice and clean. They have a jacuzzi (which we did get to indulge in and loved) and both it and the pool are heated and relaxing. They also had cabanas and a lovely view. After we finished eating our room was ready and we made our way on up.
We had the treetop room with a balcony facing the pool right in the center on the 2nd floor (Room 309). It was awesome. Very clean. Very nice. The bathroom had a separate glass shower and an oversized bathtub which was equally nice. We only stayed for 1 night (as that's really all you need if you really feel the need stay over in Solvang) and that next morning when we went out for breakfast I had called down and asked if they could freshen up the room they nicely did.

Maybe it was because of deal but our room was awful.  It looked out onto the back parking lot, was incredibly dark, run down and drab.  We were willing to overlook that because it was time to drink wine!  Their sign out front advertised a special happy hour.  When we asked the concierge about it he informed us that the bar was closed for a private event for the entire afternoon and evening.  Umm hello, take down your sign!  We opted for their restaurant.  The food was good! We got the burger and it was great.  The next morning we tried to locate hot water for our daughter's bottle and the staff was rude and told us to go to a nearby coffee shop!

We spent the night in a double queen room and admittedly weren't here for long before departing for the rest of our journey, but the room was well appointed and spacious with comfortable beds.  The bathroom was also very spacious, with a large shower and oversize vanity area.  Very comfortable.

We didn't utilize any of the hotel dining options, instead opting to take a walk into town the following morning and lunch at one of the local Danish bakeries.  It's an easy walk into town and the village is really beautiful, so worth your time.

We booked only several days prior to our arrival on Tripadvisor/Booking.com and at that time there were only six rooms left. I booked ""The Mission Room"" or so I believed it to be an upgraded room.

A plus upon arrival is being greeted by the valets who also act as doormen. The room was a king bed with a balcony, but nothing extraordinary. It was also a disability/special needs room. I hope that someone wasn't inconvenienced by this room being taken.

Other than a torn, well worn and very dirty bolstered chair and coffee cups with some type of residue in the bottom the room was nice. The bed, pillows and bedding were clean and reasonably comfortable. While the write up for the room boasted of a grand view of the Santa Ynez valley it was indeed grand however, once you looked past the parking lot.  

My other complaint would be the lack of an onsite gym. They did however offer a discount one-day pass to a local gym. It seems to me charging $236 a night they could afford to set aside a room with a few treadmills, elliptical and some stationary bikes. 

All in all, it was average hotel. I say this primary due to there is nothing special or unique to make it stand out. Solvang is still a neat little town to visit though.",,,,,,,,,,,,22

For the record I've probably stayed at over 50 different hotels so far in my lifetime. This is my first tripadvisor review purely in response to the service my family and I received from Donna and I'd hate someone else to go through it. 
I personally witnessed her being rude to 2 other separate groups of people in front of me and then true to her form, she was unprofessional, not understanding and showed no interest in making the stay more comfortable for my family either. 
""Room with a view"" of literally a car park, was clean but was CRAZY LOUD!  People were running outside the rooms at 1am, floors were shaking and thumping so you could hear everything outside and above you. 
The whole exhaustive dealings with Donna made me want to cancel our remaining stay here, especially when she basically said it was my fault that our baby couldn't get sleep and we should of brought my whole family including our 9 month old baby to the front desk at 1.30am? Her tone and attitude was appalling. Donna also told me no one was staying above us but on night # 2 the same poor nights sleep again took place due to noise directly above us. 
Congratulations Donna, you single handily ensured we will never ever return to this Hotel again.

Linda D,39,"Billerica, Massachusetts",2016-11-30,SOLO,2016-11-13,4,"Nice, but not rave worthy ","The hotel is clean, quiet and beds are comfortable but some of the reviews I think rate higher than the hotel deserves, especially considering rates can be high at times. It's a very popular town, especially on weekends. Be careful if calling to reserve- I was routed to a central number and didn't realize they had another property (at the casino). The reservation clerk didn't say, either, so when I showed up I it turned out my reservation was at the other hotel! Thankfully, they were not full and the hostess honored the reservation and at the ""lower"" rate (though she acted as if doing me a great favor). The location is good at the edge of the shopping area and the pool looked nice but I didn't use. Nice toiletries but the shower had some mildew showing at edges. In conclusion, I think the hotel may be one of the nicer ones in Solvang but I wouldn't overpay despite its 4 diamond rating. If I were booking on that basis, I'd be disappointed. ",,,,,,,,,,,,46

Laurie S,4,"Los Angeles, California",2016-10-31,COUPLES,2016-10-21,4,Restful quiet hotel,"My husband and I stayed for 4 nights in October 2016.  The hotel is located in a great spot at the ""end"" of town somewhat near the Mission.  Easy walking distance to all the sites, shopping, bakeries and restaurants in downtown Solvang.  The hotel rooms are well kept, clean and restful/inviting.  Our experience with nearly all staff at the hotel was very positive.  The person who checked us in however was an exception to that.  She was brief, in a hurry and somewhat rude to us, she didn't tell us about the wifi connections/password or other ""checkin"" info. I later came to ask for an extra bar of soap and shampoo and told her our room number and she didn't make an effort to write down our room number or say that she'd get this for us she just nodded and grunted.  (She was seated in the lobby at the desk, with no other hotel guests in sight but she was busy talking and texting on her cellphone).   After the day passed without receiving the soap etc I went downstairs and again requested it from another staff member who was very kind and helpful and we had the soap in about 10 minutes.  All in all we enjoyed our stay at the hotel with the exception of this one particular rude front desk staff member -- all the rest of the hotel employees were friendly, kind and helpful.  It was unfortunate that the one employee made it unpleasant.  

All of the pillows on the beds were very heavy and huge -- and so puffy that we tended to take them off the bed - as we prefer flatter pillows but it was workable.  We were a bit amazed that a continental breakfast was not offered as this is a ""DANISH"" town with a bakery on every block - most other hotels in the town offers at least a ""Danish"" sweet roll and coffee.  There was coffee/tea stations throughout the hotel all day and night but not a ""Danish"" roll in sight.  There were menus for the restaurant next door but it was only open for ""brunch"", so if you are an ""early breakfast"" person you needed to leave the hotel even just to get a ""Danish"" pastry.",,,4.0,3.0,,,4.0,,,,,2

It can be seen in its buildings, cuisine and even in souvenir items sold in the shops. You would not think you were in America if you find yourself walking the streets of Solvang. 

Hotel Corque is ideally located. It is a short walk to the shops, restaurants and cafes. There is really not much to do in Solvang other than shop, wine taste and eat. 

The Hotel's check-in time is at 4 PM and we got in a bit early. They did not have a room available earlier so we were made to wait until 4. They did take our luggage and store them in their storage room while we went around town until 4 PM. The lady who assisted us seemed annoyed at the number of suitcases we had to store. We did get a room on the first floor as previously requested.

We were finally able to check-in at 4 PM. The room was spacious and well appointed. Big flat screen TV, 2 queen beds, desk and a very nice huge bathroom with strong water pressure from the showers. WIFI was intermittent  in the room but strong in the lobby and restaurant.

The hotel has a fine dining restaurant beside it. We had dinner there. The restaurant is quite pricey but it serves decent food with a really nice ambiance.

The hotel also offers free shuttle services to a casino 4 miles away. This could be a big come on for guests at this hotel because Solvang is asleep by 9 PM and there isn't really anything much to do after that.

Ashley M,11,"Los Angeles, California",2016-10-31,COUPLES,2016-10-13,5,Affordable romantic getaway for a night,"Stayed one night, 10/9/16, for a quick, romantic out-of-town getaway at a time when prices weren't ridiculous. Check-in was friendly and professional. The lobby, while small, is very smart looking, very stylish. We happened to have the room seemingly furthest from the elevators, but no big deal. The bed looked especially enormous given the small size of the room, but I liked the decor very much. Bed and pillows were comfortable, bathroom was clean and very nice, and the stay was quiet and relaxing. 

My only complaints are that there was a spot where the faux leather (?) on my side of the headboard--it looks nicer than my description makes it sound!--was subbed off, as if people frequently rest their heads against it while watching TV, and I couldn't get the drain stopper in the bathtub to work.

If you’re looking for a quality stay, you will be pleased. Here are some highlights:

•	The entrance is warm and welcoming with lounging chairs.
•	Attentive staff (friendly reception and greet you immediately upon entrance).
•	Plentiful parking.
•	Freebees: Wi-Fi, pool access, tea/coffee.
•	Nice restaurant next door (Root 246) with a bar and happy hour! (Dinners average around $30 a plate but you can share and get an appetizer).
•	Comfortable room and bed (good night sleep). Didn’t mind relaxing in there while my wife got ready. 

A couple places you can drive out to: the vineyards in Los Olivos (Firestone!), the tasting rooms in Los Olivos (Toretti!) and Chumash casino.  

To be honest, I cannot complain about anything. We only stayed one night and the day flew. I recommend staying two nights so you can enjoy the town and experience wine tasting in the vineyards at a slower pace.

travelingman010,129,,2016-07-31,FAMILY,2016-07-19,2,Hotel Corque in Solvang wasn't a great experience for many reasons.,"My wife and I recently spent two nights at the Hotel Corque in Solvang and it wasn't a great experience for many reasons.
We had made reservations a long time in advance asking for an upper level room.  When we arrived at about 3 PM, we were told that the only room available to us was on the first floor.  As it turns out not only did this room overlook the parking lot, but that at 7 am Sunday morning, laundry drop off and pick up was conducted right outside our window.  The man pushing the wagons did try to be quiet, but he wasn't.

After going into our room, I noticed that there was no safe to lock up our valuables.  I went to the desk and was told that ""not all the rooms have safes, but don't worry we have safes in the backroom.""  OK, this wasn't convenient, but what choice did I have at this point.  A few hours later, I came out to lock up my valuables in the hotel safe and was told sorry we don't have any safes available.  The concierge or manager Lawrence told me that there was nothing that he could do and it was the responsibility of the guests to take care of their own valuables.

Another issue was with a recommendation for a quick, easy restaurant to go to for lunch  at 3:30 pm.  Lawrence gave us the name of a place.  When we arrived there, we were told that the restaurant was no longer serving lunch, only happy hour food.  And, by the way, most of the other Solvang restaurants do the same thing.  Apparently, our concierge wasn't aware of this.  He didn't offer to call the restaurant or even suggest that we call ourselves, just to be sure that we could get lunch there.  
On the positive side, the room was clean and appeared to have been updated not that long ago.",,2.0,2.0,,,3.0,,,,,,89

The luxury and price reflects this, but if you are familiar with luxury resort experiences, the Hotel Corque delivers. We stayed in a King Wine Country suite on ground level, facing pool. Large patio with resonable privacy - a hedge blocks pool crown from looking in room. The bathroom is spectacular - huge tub - the shower bottom is river rock, nice wake up on the feet. 

The staff was always available and pleasant. Pool experience is well done with lounges, tables, and cabanas. There is limited room service menu from Root 246 next door. The breakfast room service from Root 246 was spectacular - best bacon ever.

PCPA (Solvang) theater is a couple blocks away. We dined at Root 246 and grabbed coats, blankets from room before walking over to see ""Shrek"" (OMG funny).

The entire hotel structure is small but very elegant and very pleasing to the eyes, since you are in danish small town, the facade of the hotel totally matches the entire town. When you enter the lobby you will be greeted by the friendly staff on their desks. Big beautiful chairs will greet you in their lobby. Free drinks are available. When we get to the room, im impressed with the interiors, modern with a hint of country. The room and the bathroom is very clean and inviting. No bath tub though. I was hoping to have a tub but its ok. The balcony is lovely too with two iron chairs over looking the gorgeous but small pool with jacuzzi. Didnt try their amenities because of our strict sched but will definitely would love to come back. Also the balcony overlooks the beautiful hills of solvang which is lovely. Outside the hotel you can walk around and do sight seeing, they are close to restaurants and shops which is very convenient. They also provide a shuttle going to the casino which is great! A 5 min trip to the casino is not bad. I enjoy it so much. We are filipino so my husband enjoyed cinema one while i enjoy the very comfortable bed! Will definitely coming back!",,,,,,,,,,,,1

We planned to stay two nights, but a family emergency cut our trip short; the hotel staff was very understanding accommodating in this regard also.
The grounds itself are well-tended and most of the time there is a door person at the main entrance to the lobby. In addition to a standard check-in desk, there are two additional desks that serve as both check-in and concierge service. Anything you want or need, the staff will make sure it happens. Check in and check out was painless and pleasant, and this was during a very busy weekend - Mother's Day and a popular half-marathon with this property being the official lodging for the event (which is why we decided to stay here).
The rooms are well appointed and furnished beautifully. We requested a view of the Santa Rita Hills and we were given a third floor king room with a balcony and the beautiful view we requested. Everything about the room made it so we didn't want to leave and looked forward to coming back to our room.
Both the bed and bath linens were exceptional, with extra towels, pillows, and blankets already in the room. The complimentary bathrobes provided during our stay were the most comfortable robes of any property I have stayed, including Trump and Lowes Hotels. 
We didn't order room service, but the prices were standard and the options looked delicious.
While we stayed at this property because of a racing event my husband participated in, we will definitely be back for a romantic get away. We plan to dine at the property's restaurant on our next visit as well.",Ask for a room with a view of the Santa Rita Hills.,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,,,,,,49

Check-in was easy and they gave us good recommendations for restaurants, sightseeing and horseback riding which is something we wanted to do. 

Pros
-location: easy to get to. Close to sightseeing, restaurants and shops 
 next to root 246 restaurant which is an attractive hip restaurant.
-Spacious rooms with 2 queen beds
-pool and hot tub ( we didn't use it)
-24 hour shuttle that takes you to and from the Chumash Casino
-Helpful front desk staff
-Coffee, water and tea at the front for all hotel guests to enjoy
-free parking

Cons
-housekeeping was subpar in cleaning our room: glasses were not washed. Used towels weren't changed. 
-They don't have an in house gym. We could use the one next door for $12

We were told they were hand tied and seriously THE most comfortable bed I have ever slept in, even better than mine and mine is comfy. Not so this time. I asked why the bed was not very comfortable and they had no real answer. 

The Friday night we checked in was disappointing too. Although one of the girls at the front desk the night we checked in was wonderful, I think her name is Sharena, but that Friday night others were cold and not welcoming. This is a boutique hotel, so you do expect a little more warmth. Saturday's staff was better. 

The rooms are very clean, pretty, and the bathrooms more than adequate. We had a lovely view out on the Romeo and Juliet balcony with a view of the Santa Ynez Mountains, so you see it's not all bad.

There is no restaurant in this hotel so if you want food you will have to go out for it. Solvang is full of restaurants. They do have a couple of vending machines. I understand they have some type of happy hour for a small charge.

Honestly, I guess because our first experience was so fabulous and this one was not, I probably will not go back to Hotel Corque. For what they charge for a room and what I experienced, I do not think it's worth it, for me anyway. My husband felt the same way.

Solvang is changing as well and this may have contributed to my disappointment with this hotel in general. I understand Solvang is great for wine tasting now, but I loved the little boutiques and the charm of Scandinavia, not so much of that as before.

At first we were worried that we might be able to hear noises from the lobby and he wouldn't be able to rest. Surprisingly, the room was really quiet bf took a good nap. However, there were kids upstairs running around about an hour after we checked in and we could hear the foot steps quite loudly. I went back to the front desk and talked to the front desk supervisor Lawrence to ask to switch a room. He immediately looked up a room on the second floor far away from the lobby and at the same time kept apologizing for the inconvenient (which is not even his fault! he wasn't the one who assigned us the room in the first place).
Lawrence switched us to a bigger room on the second floor which is super far away from all the noises, and thanks to him, my bf got a great rest the whole night and felt a lot better.

The lobby is cool and cozy and the rooms are nicely done.  Our room was a double queen, which was on the small size.  But the furnishings were very nice, the amenities good, and as many have mentioned, the beds were very comfortable.  If I was rating the hotel on the room only it would have gotten a 4.  However, I had to give the hotel a 3 for its service, or lack thereof.  

We arrived at the hotel at 4pm exactly to check in as we had a party to get ready for and needed to change and get ready in the room.  The hotel stated check in time is 4pm, so we assumed our room would be ready (this is already a very late check in time.).  However, our room was not ready.  So, we waited...and waited...until 4:30pm when we were told we were given a different room because our room was still dirty.  How is this possible when check out is noon.  No one cleaned the room within the 4 hour window?  Absolutely ridiculous.  Well, we thought, maybe they will give us a nicer room....no.  Then we thought, maybe they'll give us something nice like a bottle of wine or some fruit or chocolates...no.  We got nothing.  Totally disappointing.  

Also annoying, but I could have looked past, was the fact that the coffee in the lobby was always out.  How hard is it to check this and refill it when it's empty?  And, no matter how many cleaning people were around, the lobby was littered with trash - someone's half eaten food, a bag on the floor, napkins on the floor, etc.

The rooms were extremely comfortable with all the facilities you would expect from a 4to 5 star hotel, including an empty fridge! We loved it so much we stayed an extra night, and the staff could not have been more helpful, by allowing us into our new room four hours earlier than normal check-in (as our original room was booked for the extra night).

There is on tap tea, coffee and iced water, which you can serve yourself at any time of day and the ambience of the hotel lobby, which is extremely comfortable is very relaxing. The only drawback for some residents would be the absence of an on-sight bar/restaurant, but like many 'budget' hotels in Europe this is served by an attached restaurant next door, but it is not open all day. However, you are in Solvang, wine country, and there are plenty of wineries, wine tasting shops, bars and restaurants lining the pretty Danish inspired streets in this Southern Californian town.

In the morning take a nice walk to Paula's Pancake House (you will need to walk off what you just ""put down""). Stop into a couple of the local bakeries and pick up some amazing pastries and a couple of bottles of wine from the wine shop and walk back (stopping at the Solvang Brewing Company on the way back).  For a late afternoon ""pick me up"" stop by Solvang Restaurant for some ebelskivers (Dutch donuts) topped with raspberry and powered sugar and enjoy your wine at one of their outdoor tables or in their lobby (big comfy chairs).  If you want to venture out drive about 15 minutes to Los Olivos to Dragonette Tasting Room then stop off and eat at Los Olivos Cafe & Wine Merchant.

MissChristina13,2,"Newbury Park, California",2015-08-31,COUPLES,2015-08-09,4,A nice hotel but needs some improvement to be a 4 Diamond AAA rating,"I agree with fellow reviewers that the hotel offers nicer amenities than other hotels.  This is not a brand new hotel, it's been remodeled and the building is probably 15-20 years old?  It was previously the Royal Scandinavian Inn.  

Good amenities:  These include a more modern decor, robes, slippers, refrigerator, nice cotton sheets, and Thymes bath products.  There's even SB Roasting Co coffee in the lobby so that's a nice touch.  

The clerk at check-in was pleasant and even though we arrived 4 hours earlier than check-in time, they accommodated us and got us into a room.  Although now that I'm writing this review, I'm thinking that they hurried to clean the room for us (we were willing to wait until 4pm for regular check-in time by the way).

We stayed in the king studio room and the pics of the interior of the room (from their site) are representative.  I was under the impression that there were more views (tree line) around the hotel.  Be warned that at least two sides of the hotel are parking lot and the rear parking lot is just a continuation of several rear parking lots for businesses.  Yes, there are trees, but they're way in the distance.  I would recommend staying in the top level floor and specifically asking for tree side view only.  Another side of the hotel just faces their restaurant and adjacent businesses, so not a great view at all.  

For those of you who have never been to Solvang, be informed that it's such a quaint and small town that any hotel is within walking distance of everything.  I say that because it's touted as such and really, it's not unusual.  And it's very safe to walk around in the evening.

Although I didn't take their shuttle to Chumash casino, I noticed that it came quite frequently.  While checking in and then waiting for our wine tour, it must have shown up 3 times within a 45 min-1 hour time frame. 

Bad:  I consider comfort and cleanliness important when I get a room.  I'd say that our room was an ""average"" level of cleanliness.  I noticed some mold growing around the tile edges of the shower and when walking on the tile floor, our slippers made a ""sticky"" sound (and it was sticky dirty, not squeeky clean).  The bed and furniture seemed clean and the sheets were a nice touch, but the pillows were too over-stuffed and hard.  Perhaps I should've asked the lobby if they had softer pillows.

All in all, our stay was average to very good.  I'm a AAA member and choose my hotels based on their 4 Diamond rating and tourist's reviews.  I'd say that this is the first time I've stayed in a 4 Diamond AAA rated hotel and felt like it was closer to a 3 1/2?    Four Diamond means ""upscale in ALL areas, refined, and an enhanced level of quality throughout.""  In my opinion, Hotel Corque should improve their cleaning and represent their ""room views"" in order to validate the $190+ room and ratings.  I'm glad that I got a mid-week deal through a travel site.",Higher floors have better views &amp; ask for tree side view only,,4.0,,4.0,,2.0,,,,,2

To their credit after I complained of the noise (didn't sleep the whole entire 1st night), they finally got quiet around 12:30a on the 2nd night and lowered the volume on the music (lose the music!).

This was so close to a five star for me but the AAA rate included two lunch buffets in the price but you had to go to a neighboring casino and the lunch buffet started at 11am.

Large rooms, just needs a few tweaks and upgrades to become the area's top hotel destination. 

In Depth Review: Stayed at the Hotel Corque (pronounced Cork) for two nights at the end of January 2015. The hotel was quiet and finding it and check-in was easy enough and convenient. We used the bell-hop to help take our luggage up to the room. They are available until about midnight daily. He was kind enough to get ice for us and point out the features of the room. Tipped him $5 and he was appreciative. They also have complimentary valet service for guests staying there. Made sure to tip the valet every time they fetched our vehicle. It was quiet when we visited and they looked bored. 

Our room was located on the second floor and faced the front of the building over the parking lot. Not much of a view. The room was large, spacious, and it was modern and clean. A nice flat screen LG TV was included and they had a ton of cable TV channels. Upon first look, the room looked great. We were happy. As we started to unpack and get ready to go out to dinner, some of the flaws of the room started to show themselves. 

Area's of opportunity for improvement: 

- Get better mattresses. The king size mattress was way too firm for our liking and we both had a tough time sleeping. Not sure why others mention ""comfortable beds?"" Maybe we had an older mattress? It was certainly not that comfortable. 

- Provide some better sleeping pillows and an option that is not feathers. I am tall and have a tough time sleeping with feather pillows. Not enough neck support. I had to call down to the front desk at 2am and request a non-feather pillow. They brought two up to me. They were very small, but they worked and I was appreciative. 

- Poor lighting in the bathroom. They actually have ""Jack N Jill Sinks"" which is a nice tough. The mirror looks like it has a light that runs down the side. It still was too dark, gave off shadows and made styling your hair or putting makeup on a difficult task. 

- No wall safe. This seemed odd as the Chumash Casino is associated with this hotel. Almost all casino hotel rooms have safe as people travel with large sums of money when the gamble. We wanted to lock up our laptop, iPad and jewelry and were unable to. Most modem hotels have a safe these days, it's standard. 

- Provide some complimentary breakfast items. Most of the hotels in this area already do this. Nothing major, just put out some muffins, bagels, croissants, danish and fruit. They have coffee and tea only. It's a nice touch and does not cost you a lot of money. 

The rooms are very nice though. They are modern and clean. Not to mention, they are quiet. We did not hear the folks next door or in the hallway. The pool area looked great, although it was closed when we visited. You can walk to anywhere in Solvang from the hotels central location. Looked like the nicest hotel we say in Solvang. 

Overall, we would certainly stay at the Hotel Corque again. It is centrally located in Solvang and the Santa Ynez Wine Region. It will take you 10 - 15 mins to hit almost every major winery in the area. The staff was top notch, friendly and helpful. They made great suggestions on restaurants, tasting rooms and wineries in the area. The restaurant and bar located a short walk next-door was a nice bonus. Please note: the restaurant, bar and lounge next door close down on Mondays. Also note, most businesses in the area close down by 6pm nightly. It's a very quiet and charming area. 

Hotel Corque was nice, few tweaks, adjustments and upgrades and it will be top notch. They are very, very close as is. Great staff, kudos to the management for running a good operation!",Ask for a room on the top floor with a good view.,,4.0,3.0,,4.0,,,,,,11

Beyond that it's fairly average.  Two cavils from our perspective.  Firstly, we booked a couple of months in advance and requested two connecting rooms.  Given that it appeared to us that most rooms in the hotel are inter-connecting (our children's room had a connecting door - it's just that it didn't connect with our room!) it didn't seem a huge ask but we didn't get it.  They were adjacent but not connecting.  Then we were told on the 'phone that our rooms would have mountain views.  Well, not quite.  If you're on the ground floor (as we were) you can see the mountains (just) but mainly what you see is a huge car park.  We were also very close to the reception area (in fact, the first rooms you came to when you left reception) which meant we were also near a rear service door where we were regularly woken up around 5:00 am by noise.  So, quite possibly the worst rooms in the hotel which is odd given how early we booked!  (See room tips below.)  So why am I giving this hotel a 4 star rating?  Well, because of what's next door...!

I used Corque to book a room block for my wedding clients getting amrried at a nearby winery. We also booked a rehearsal dinner and after party.

Part One: Hotel/Rooms
The rooms are very clean, comfortable, and modern. To book the block, I dealt with Stormie...but seriously everyone their was helpful and accommodating. The staff is exceptionally friendly and helpful and stopped at nothing to ensure all guests had a fantastic experience. I heard every guest there comment on how wonderful and accommodating the staff were, and how lovely and comfortable the rooms were. Totally a five star experience.

Part Two: The Rehearsal
We planned the rehearsal for the patio at root 246. The food there is great and we were all very excited for their halloween costume-mandatory rehearsal dinner. Of course, having not had rain in 18 months, the night of their rehearsal dinner ti was set to pour. Dorene, who managed our rehearsal event, called me at 9pm the night prior to discuss rain contingency plan. She and I decided to wait until the last moment to decide whether or not to move it into a ballroom and she patiently held out. At noon, on the day of, we decided to go with the contingency plan and move their outdoor celebration to an indoor feast. Dorene, along with managers Mike and Dhea really pulled out all the stops. They transformed a ballroom into a halloween spectacular complete with uplighting and themed soundtracks played on speakers they brought in. They also lined the tables with lights and lanterns and even filled the extra seat with a headless scarecrow. My clients were so [pleased they decided this should have been plan a from the beginning. I was overcome with gratitude for their staff's hard work, creativity and ability to make plan b as good or better than plan a. It was truly unforgettable.

Part 3: the afterparty
Once again, Corque and root 246 came through with flying colors. They make amazing drinks...and all the guests were super impressed that the bartenders remembered their drinks from the night before....especially since the night before we were all in costume. They went out of their way to ensure everyone had a good time, and the party went on until they closed. It was an excellent finale to an incredible weekend. The bride ended up thrilled about the rain and because of the ahrd work and dedication of the Corque and their wonderful staff, all their guests had a remarkable and unforgettable time. 

Hotel Corque brought the magic!!!!

RichieSel,105,"Los Angeles, California",2014-08-31,FRIENDS,2014-09-07,4,Nice Hotel in a Quaint Town!,"Hotel Corque is a beautiful hotel at the end of Alisal Street, walking distance to all the shops and restaurants in Solvang. The lobby is beautiful with the huge chandelier and giant chairs, with fresh lemon water waiting for you thirsty from your trip or walking the streets all day. We got checked in right away, and found the room to be beautiful and with chocolates from the turn down service. The beds and pillows are very comfortable, and robes were laid waiting for us to use them to the pool or jacuzzi, which is very inviting in the hotel courtyard in the summer heat!
I love the toiletries, and the giant showerheads and glass shower. The room has coffeemaker, giant flat screen TVs, free parking and internet, and lots of plugs at bedside for your devices.
We got upgraded to a suite the next day, and Romario and his brother, the 2 gorgeous model looking bellboys at Hotel Corque helped us with our bags. The Chumash Casino is only 3 miles away, so if you can't stay at Chumash, this hotel is a great alternative, and is a destination by itself because there are plenty of places to go to for non gambling friends and family. There is a historic mission church, you can play golf or go to wineries, or feed the emus and ostriches at Ostrichland. The restaurant next door route 246 is excellent for dinner or Sunday brunch, but there are also lots of other restaurants to choose from..

Mission Santa Ines and  Solvang's afternoon farmer's market and concert in the park.  Every morning I walked over to Mission Santa Ines for 8:00 mass with the wonderful Franciscan Capuchin Fathers.

This hotel has by far been our favorite!  Usually it is out of our price range but they recently had a sale for $108/night (around $120 with tax) so we were excited to give it a try.  The staff was so welcoming and friendly, especially the girl at check-in, and she let me choose which floor we could stay on (we went for the top!).  She also gave us an unexpected coupon for free brunch/lunch over at the casino, which we took advantage of the next day and enjoyed it.  The room and bathroom was beautiful, tastefully designed and decorated.  The bed was very comfortable and the linens were of a high quality.  The robes that they provide were very soft! They offer them for purchase, which was tempting!  

We went down to the pool and while it was a little cold outside, the pool was heated and comfortable, and the hot tub was perfect.  One of the great things about the pool was the beautiful furniture they have invested in that really presents well.  There are plenty of lounges, a table fire pit that they offered to light for us but we declined, round tables with umbrellas where the whole family could sit, and these awesome cabanas with curtains for a little privacy or to block some of the sun. There were plenty of towels on the lounges for us to use.

We didn't go to their restaurant adjacent to the hotel, we opted for another fantastic choice in town (The Hadsten House was amazing!), but we did get room service breakfast in the morning and were very happy with the food.  I think the room service comes from the restaurant but I am not positive.

The hotel is located on the ""edge"" of the main town center, but it's a small town so it didn't take long to walk anywhere.  In fact, I liked that this hotel was couple blocks away from the main road through town (246), because there is more road noise and pedestrian traffic around the hotels along that route that take away from the sense of privacy.

All in all, Hotel Corque is the best hotel we have stayed at in Solvang.  I think it is a really good example of a hotel that could be just ok, like many other hotels in the area, but they have really invested in taking it to a higher level.  This has been accomplished through investment in quality furniture in the lobby and rooms, thoughtful bathroom and pool area designs, nice TVs, and a staff that values customer service.  Great job Hotel Corque!  I hope you offer another special soon for our next trip, as it was a fantastic value!","Rooms facing the pool have balconies, but they are not private balconies.

The pool was great too, with immaculately clear water and lots of chairs and even South Beach-style cabanas around it.

When we returned after 7 p.m. we met veteran hospitality person Miguel, who checked us all in the place.  The lobby is cute with a fireplace, a number of chairs, reading material and good coffee.  We did not use the pool or jacuzzi, but both looked clean and well cared for.  
Some in our party had a more difficult time checking in than others.  Did I mention the day of wine tasting?  At this point, I will go back to mention hotel Corque's employee, Miguel, who was extremely patient, professional and helpful during the check in process.  
The rooms were quite nice. We had a king bed and a view of the pool, parking lot and some hills.  There was a coffee maker in room as well as room service available from what looked to be a very nice restaurant and bar which was right next door to the hotel.  The bathroom was large with two sinks and very soft water which I do not care for.  No points off for soft water.  There was a large t.v., ipod docking radio, and most in the group of ten thought the beds to be quite comfortable.
I regret that we went to Solvang on what turned out to be a very busy weekend in the Central California wine country.  Thus, the rates at our hotel were a bit inflated.  On almost any other weekend of the year, I am certain the rates would have been significantly less.

Check in was easy…a nice gentleman gave us a bit of a price reduction and was very friendly. The room had a view of the mountains but also the parking lot. I asked for a quiet room…and it was..for the most part. I heard knocking of doors 2x.  Also the pillows on the bed were very low quality in my opinion; no head support. But the bed was comfortable.  The room was spacious and the bathroom was nice. Did not appreciate a couple of small hairs in the sink though….There was a flat screen TV, coffee maker, and refrigerator.  Parking is free.  I did not take advantage of other amenities on site: business center, fitness center, spa, and pool so I cannot make any comments about those comforts.
Lastly, we were considering staying one more night…I asked a young lady in the front desk if we could stay for another night (same room and same rate).  But since it was going to be a Friday, she said no that it was going to be 100 dollars more per night. She was somewhat aloof and did not bother to apologize (I was disappointed). Oh well at least checking in was a lot more pleasant than when we checked out…I am assuming that she will not last long in the hospitality business for long since she was NOT hospitable.

Schwenketta,6,,2014-02-28,FAMILY,2014-02-17,3,"Nice management, but not worth the $$$","You can't blame the management for who can pay to stay there - but a few things to note:

1) There is a lovely lobby area with giant comfy chairs and a fireplace - its inviting and we stopped to enjoy the area coming back from dinner - however, the staff sits at desks somewhat close by, and with no noise control or sound absorbers- you are bombarded with the loud voices of the staff checking everyone in - literally sounds like they are yelling in your ear.  My hair salon has sound absorbers all over the place so that the hard floors don't echo conversation - Corque could look into these. Or just check in people a little farther away at the counter?  It's just set up poorly.

2) The lobby aside - let's get to the hot tub.  When my son and I were heading down there at 7pm - he announced that there was someone smoking while in the tub.  So, I called the front desk and asked if smoking was allowed - if they had said yes, no worries - we would have just waited it out.  Their answer was this:  ""If it bothers another guest, we ask that they put it out"" - Ok, I said - well I was going to go down with my son, should we wait?  ""No, I will handle it, "" she said.  But when I walked down into the lobby - she recognized me and said this ""Oh - you called about the smoking?  When you get out there- just tell them it bothers you and they will put it out.""  What?  odd.  The manager gave her a look, and she ran out to the pool area.... and I guess ""Handled it"" - in 2014, I say all power to the smokers, but in shared spaces, it just seems like a thing of the past.  The trailer trash at the hot tub was gifting their selection of country twang on a portable speaker when we arrived, the young ""lady"" who I think was for hire - was tubbing in a see through lace teddy, and decided to sit outside the tub when we arrived to - I don't know - put on a show for my 8 year old?  So - here is some of the peeps we ran into.  I think she was pouting about the lack of smoking availability and knew we were the culprits.  Gave my little one an opportunity to learn about the other side of the tracks - and some giggles later - so everything's an opportunity.

3) The room service staff was awesome.  Quick, efficient - split an order between two rooms, as I ordered half of it for my folks down the hall - lovely, and coffee was excellent :)  

4) The manager himself - was professional, friendly and very kind.  I just think he needs to access some training for his staff.

The $330 a night price tag I would say is a bit high - having stayed at many 4star hotels for that same amount - there's an element of feeling like (while the rooms are nicely appointed) you are still at a motel like feel.  Part of it is the crowd, and the rest is the under-educated staff. (management and room service aside).

The hotel has a great down town location, literally a moments stroll from the heart of the very picturesque town of Solvang.

The room we stayed in was very spacious and well appointed... UK hoteliers please take note, we do love ""fresh"" coffee facilities, plump towels and pleantiful toiletries! 

Our room was on the ground floor over looking the front parking lot, at the end of the corridor which led on to a small court yard.  There was no traffic or pedestrian noise which disturbed us, even the adjoining restaurant across the court yard which had an outdoor dining area didn't disturb.

The rooms along with the rest of the property which we witnessed were immaculate in their presentation.

The only spoilers for us was the fact the property did not offer breakfast or an option to grab a muffin/pastry in the lobby with their complementary coffee... Shame.  But a very short stroll into the town to the many restaurants and bakeries took care of that!  

The pool area was also closed, much to our disappointment, given it was a lovely 24oC during our new year break compared to 5oC at home in blighty!  We were looking forwards to a lazy afternoon by the pool, but that wasn't an option, so it was a visit to one if the town's many wineries instead!

We chose to dine in the hotel's adjoining restaurant on our second evening - that was also a disappointment.  An attempt at fine dining was made, however service and quality of food did not live up to expectation and price (I work in the ""biz"" in a fine dining establishment and I'm pretty well qualified in my claim).  Aperitifs arrived with the entrée (poor appetiser choice, hence this) accompanied by wine chosen to accompany our meal... We asked more than 3 occasions where our aperitifs were only to be told there is a delay at the bar, all the drinks then arrived to take up most of the room on a very small table and to our neighbouring diner's inqusitiveness, we looked like alco's!

Included a fridge (empty!) so we could store sodas and snacks we brought with us (lucky - read more later).

We arrived Thanksgiving Day and the hotel desk recommended their restaurant Root 246 for its terrific happy hour specials.   We went to the bar at Root 246 and were told that the only deal was a Thanksgiving dinner fixe price meal for $65.00 per person.   We passed and ordered glasses of wine.  As we got ready to leave, a guy down the bar was having a burger and fries - not on the $65.00 per person dinner menu.   Then the bartendered offered up ability to buy one of the courses singly vs. the entire meal.  We passed.   

After a walk around the locked up tight town of Solvang we found one place that was open and serving dinner, Bit of Denmark.  As one of the few places open, it was packed.  We sat at the bar and ordered an open faced pork sandwich and glasses of wine.  We were lucky and were served pretty quickly since it was a cold sandwich.  The restaurant closed at 8:30pm.  So we returned to the hotel and had a picnic supper using snacks we had stored in the mini-fridge in our room!

The bathroom in our room was gorgeous and spacious but also tricky to get in and out the giant bathtub with no hand rails or way to easily get in/out.   If you get in the tub, keep a bathtowel nearby so you can wet it down and grab onto side of tub to climb out.  Note that it also takes 20 minutes to fill the tub, and the same amount of time to drain it out so plan ahead.

What's not to like:   when we reserved there was no disclaimer that any construction was going on at the hotel - the entire pool area was a dirtpile with the pool covered over and the hot tub a whole in the ground.

We would definitely return and stay here if in the area again, noting that:  restaurants close very early - plan ahead, and use extreme caution if using the lovely bathtub.",high floor rooms facing &quot;treetop view&quot; will give you a view of mountains and the pool.,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,,,,170

SDAim,10,,2013-05-31,COUPLES,2013-10-25,5,Really nice place to stay,"I stayed here with my husband and my two sisters visiting from out of town so that we could do the ""Sideways"" tour, since they loved the movie and had never done this particular wine country. On my prior trips to the Santa Barbara County Vintners Association spring wine festival, we've stayed at the Marriott in Buellton, and twice at a hotel in Lompoc. This time, since my sisters and I are partly of Danish descent, I thought it would be fun to stay in Solvang, and Hotel Corque got the best reviews. We were not disappointed!
     First off, I had researched and found a killer rate of $99/night on TravelZoo, but when I went to book it, TravelZoo had indicated that the offer was no longer available. I called Hotel Corque and spoke with a very nice kid named Josh, who gave me the $99 rate on both of our rooms -- one king and one with two queens. I doubt he had to do that, and I really appreciated the gesture. He explained that they were ground level rooms at that rate, which I never like, but I was willing to give it a try since I know what it usually costs to stay here.
    Upon arriving after a very exhausting and long 5-1/2 hour drive from San Diego, we were checked in promptly and were given really lovely adjoining rooms on the second floor -- not the ground floor! It was absolutely perfect. The appointments were gorgeous, and the bed was very comfortable. There was free, fresh coffee in the lobby each morning if you didn't feel like making it in the room, and the little refrigerator came in handy to store our leftovers from our wonderful dinners out (Los Olivos Cafe and The Hitching Post II). They even provided two small complimentary water bottles next to the coffee maker and another two were chilling in the fridge.
    Check out was noon, I believe, although we were out by about 10:30 so that we could hit our first winery at 11. After just having stayed at not one but two places back east that had brutal 10 a.m. checkouts, it was refreshing not having to call the front desk and grovel for some extra time.
    We will definitely stay here again as I also had a chance to eyeball a few of the other places I had considered booking (Hadsten House, Kronenberg Inn, etc.). I thought the other places were cute, but it was like comparing motels to a really nice hotel. In other words, no comparison. I can also say that although eating at Root 246 didn't work into our plans on this trip (it's closed on Mondays and maybe Tuesdays, as well?), I have eaten there once before and it was fabulous.","I think our room on the second floor overlooked the parking lot, so I don&#39;t know if there are ones with a better view or not.

Noahskultety,41,,2013-03-31,COUPLES,2013-10-14,3,"Quiet, peaceful, warm environment.","Hotel Corque give you a feeling if truly being away.  I suggest staying during the week when the hotel is a little more quiet. The one down side about this hotel is you have the few random people staying here thinking they are ""high rollers"" and are a little hard to handle due to the fact that Chumash Casino gives many discounted rates to the hotel if the play at their casino.  The hotel is in a great location to venture Solvang. You can wine taste and walk back to the hotel with ease. If you're a gambler but don't like the buzz of a casino hotel, then this is the place for you. Free shuttles take you to and from the casino at all hours.

The pool is nothing extravagant here, but it is very peaceful as long as the select few loud mouthed people aren't there. 

All together, it's a nice hotel, staff for the most part has it together and are friendly. Some of the management I the hotel are hard to judge due to the fact that they feel they are managing the Ritz Carlton and have a little pompous attitude, and at the same time, don't do too much to accommodate you if something is troublesome. 
Prior to my last stay, I never had a problem here, so I am hoping it is an isolated incident, however I must explain what happened. 
There was a loud party next to my room and they kept us up until 4:00 am. We went to the front desk to complain and they said they would take care of it. Finally after two or three complaints they took care of it, however, we were still kept up till 4 AM.
In the morning when the manager was in, I spoke  with him about the situation and how we were kept up late and did not get a good nights sleep. He was not very accommodating due to the fact that my club Playcard for the Chumash Casino wasn't as high as he felt that it should have been. He claimed that I I had spent more money at the Casino, he could've helped me. I simply explained to him that I was up there to make deposits and purchases for a wedding we were planning to have at their hotel. Therefore, through out my 2 day stay, I spent nearly $5,000.00 trying to get things together for a wedding. Since this situation happened, we have decided to pull our wedding location from the hotel out of fear that out 100 plus guests that would be staying there may get the same treatment we did when we had a issue. Another side note, I gave the hotel the chance to make things up to me by writing a long email directly to the hotel manger who I spoke with, and 6 plus months later, I have never heard back. Sort of sad they lost a $20,000 plus wedding over something so simple.
Aside from the problems of our last stay, the hotel all together is great. Would I stay there again? I probably would, however, an apology from the management would be nice. ",,,,,,,,,,,,28

The front lobby is stylish- and patrons will normally be checked in at a desk, versus standing in line at a counter.  We have always had very courteous and helpful service- so we are surprised at the comments from some of the other reviewers.  The last time we went, the lady who checked us in went out of her way to provide a long list of restaurants in the area that provide a discount using the Chumash Card.  The gentleman sitting at the opposite desk went online and gave us even more information while we finished the check in process.  Again- we have always had the kindest service from the folks at the front desk- whether we were in a long line to check in, or we were the only ones there.  

Ff you request a specific room type, you will absolutely be given the room of your choice (provided they have one available).  This hotel is a hot spot for wedding parties, so the summer and fall months can get a bit busy.  But call early enough and request a balcony with a view of the Santa Ynez mountains, and you're in.

We have stayed on the third floor, the second floor, the first floor with patio, and the studio with no balcony.  All of the rooms are lovely- and we have never heard anyone loud in the rooms above ours.  The decor is lovely, the beds are made with super comfortable linens and duvet; the only thing I would request is a couple extra pillows, as 2 pillows on the large queen size is just not enough to be cozy.

The bathrooms are wonderful- we actually prefer the set up without the bathtub.  This layout has 2 sinks on opposing walls with plenty of counter space- and the shower seems just a bit bigger than the bathroom with tub.  There is a vanity mirror, delicious smelling soap and lotion, and plenty of fluffy towels.

The room comes with empty mini-fridge, perfect for wine and cheese, but no mini bar.  This is one area they should consider.  There's a coffee maker in the room with coffee, tea and hot cocoa, and a large flat screen TV.  Only problem with the TV- there is no FOX News!!  

The adjoining restaurant, Root 246, is a great spot for bar snacks and yummy cocktails.  They're always coming up with new beverage combinations, and they have the best smoked ice cubes for the Old Hickory drink.  We typically have Sunday brunch here- it is a small buffet, but the food quality is top notch, and the service is impeccable.  A big shout out for Ida, Israel, Jessica and the tall male bartender (darn it, can't remember his name!) with the lovely smile always on his face.  The flatbreads are amazing with fresh arugula and the meat/cheese special of the day.  The merguesa (sp?) was spicy good, the burgers are great- and the prices are very reasonable for the quality of food.

All in all, this is an excellent hotel in the heart of Wine Country- and they provide shuttle service to the Chumash Casino, which is 4 miles down the road.  The hotel is clean, the rooms are spacious and comfortable, the staff is friendly, the restaurant has great food-- and it's a nice alternative to the cute Danish hotels.

One tip- if you do go to the Chumash Casino, make sure to sign up for their Players Card.  It's free to sign up, and I think they give you $50 in free play.  If you play enough, you earn points for discounts on rooms, spa treatments and buffets (this hotel only has Sunday brunch; the Casino has a large buffet for breakfast, lunch and dinner- try Thursday night for the Southern BBQ).  And if you can make a trip on Tuesday, they provide double your ""free play"" points.","The Mission View rooms on the right side of the hotel have better views of the Mission, golf course and vineyards.

They've completely re-modeled the place and it's gorgeous.  The rooms are very clean, the bathroom with its two sinks and glassed-in shower are wonderful.
Bed: comfortable with a variety of pillow ""textures"" and types to suit your preferences.  
WiFi:  works great.
Amenities:  small fridge, wine glasses, and all the other things a quality hotel offers.  Flat screen TV. Free copy of USA Today - a bit of a milque-toast publication, but I guess they don't want to get anyone agitated while on vacation.

Nice place... so why only a 4 out of 5?

The pool is very nice if small.  Since staying at some other resorts lately, I guess I've been spoiled by what a pool - or poolS - could be.  Why spoil the ambiance with gaudy signs advising ""No Diving"" etc.   - is that a state requirement or just some lawyer's idea of keeping the management safe from lawsuits?   Either way, having the huge signs really clashes with the rest of the property.  Maybe that's a trivial complaint, but there it is.
So OK, I'm a news junkie even when away on vacation. I watch a variety of news outlets and subscribe to everything from the far-left ""Nation"" magazine, to the Limbaugh Letter.
I watch MSNBC and Fox News, but wait...   I can get CNN, but when I try and access Fox News, it's ""no signal"" time.  The printed material in the room says it's on Channel ""6"" - but no signal.  The electronic menu says it's on Channel ""15,"" but again, it's not.  Are the Chumash censoring Fox News?   I think they might just be - and that bugs.

For what this hotel offers the room rates are very reasonable, However on this trip ( we stayed Weds & Thurs) the reservationist told us the 2nd night would almost be double because of an event in town of which she didn't know what it was. Since room rates are usually less expensive Sun thru Thurs. we were surprised but accepted the rate since we enjoy this hotel so much.

We were able to stay at the Hotel Corque for 2 years in a row after they remodeled. The bad news for us is that they have now completely priced us out of this hotel. Come on now by the time you pay all the taxes it is now well over $200.00 a night and this is for Solvang. For the past 2 years we have stayed at other hotels in Solvang but we do miss the Hotel Corque. Since they are owned by the Chumash Casino I think they are more interested in putting up their high rollers in the hotel. Oh they used to have a continental breakfast but they eliminated that also. So if you want to pay high rates for Solvang, yes stay there the location is perfect, but as far as caring for long time guests, they could care less.

As REPEAT GUESTS, we knew exactly which room we wanted to stay in for this big weekend.  Unfortunately, our stay was anything but relaxing and enjoyable.  Considering the Presidential suite is around $750/night, we were treated with absolutely no appreciation or engagement in terms of guest experience.

I placed multiple calls to room service Sunday morning, in which I was put on hold for so long that I eventually hung up.  What's even more shocking was no one even thought about calling me back to see what I needed!!!!   I was appalled that I can't even have a bagel delivered to my room.  We're in a $750/night suite and after repeated calls for room service, management can't seem to understand that we AT LEAST deserve a call back!!!!

Check-out time was noon and check-in time was 4:00.  UNANNOUNCED knock at our door 15 minutes after check-out time with a luggage cart to hurry us out of the room!!!!   UNBELIEVABLE!!!!  Then, at the front desk to check-out there was not a question of how was our stay, how was our weekend, and the lack of personality from the front desk staff was absolutely apparent when the only words that came out of his mouth was ""PERFECT, PERFECT""!!!!

Our experience at the Hotel Corque this past weekend in the PRESIDENTIAL SUITE was anything BUT perfect!!!

We arrived early and just wanted to park the car at the hotel and walk around Solvang.  The receptionist at the front desk told us our room was ready.  That was a really  nice surprise!  After our walk around Solvang we went for a very refreshing swim in the pool. The pool is located in an area with lots of sun and a great view of the Santa Ynez valley.  If you prefer not to swim you can lounge around the pool.  It's a perfect spot to just relax and let go of all your stress.  My husband and I woke up to the sound of mission bells and I went to 8:00 mass at Santa Ines mission.  The mission is  near the hotel.

The hotel is very centrally located.   (the town seems very safe and clean and a walkers paradise.)

The staff was kind and friendly, from the minute you pull up under the porte cochere, to the time you're sitting at a desk for check it. (And yes, I much prefer a face to face check-in sitting down at a desk.)  (standing at a counter for check-in seems very motel-6 to me., so I very much appreciate being able to sit/relax and check in with a friendly person.

Speaking of, a shout-out to Tommy!   Thank you for your services this past time at check-in.   To the Hotel Corque management....  a word of advice., that Tommy is a KEEPER!   Tommy is exactly the type of person I want checking me in to a hotel.    Kind, cordial and knowledgeable.

To include... waking up....  walking through the lobby.... saying good morning, only to have Tommy respond with ....  ""Good Morning Mr. - - - - -"" (and using my last name.)    Very smart young man.

I've stayed here one other time...   I was on the back, ground level with a walk out patio. (nice)
This stay, I was in the front, no patio and window facing the road.    With the window closed... you hear NOTHING, open that window and there were times it sounded as if you were on a freeway and yet oddly it's a two land road in a small town.      But in any event, with the window closed there is no noise at all and the room was lovely.   (thank you.)   (Id stay under the same circumstances in a front room -  any day of the week.)

One final tip for travelers.   I believe from time to time if one has a players card from the local casino (Chumash) they offer reduced rates here.  (I believe the hotel is owned by the casino)  And if one wanted to go to the casino, I believe it's about 6 miles away., with a shuttle service that picks up out front.

I've traveled all over the world, and without hesitation would stay at the Hotel Corque if my future travel plans included being in this part of California.","Ask for a room on the back, preferably ground level.",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,,,110

Rooms: The rooms feels new and clean. The room comes with a small frig so you can keep your drinks in there cold.  Our room had a balcony (i think all the pool facing rooms had balconies but I'm not sure about the rooms facing the other direction), which was great.

The check-in was fast and courteous. The room was a good size and immaculate. The hotel's restaurant was favorably reviewed by the L.A. Times a few years ago.

This hotel is a text-book example of what appears to be a decent property from outward appearances, but the service stops at the fake professional appearance of the staff; they are rude, incompetent, they lie about specifics regarding property maintenance and their stating they would correct deficiences, and the amenties you are paying for are not useable due to poor maintenance and lack of materials (towels) and personnel who really care if a guest is satisfied.  STAY ELSEWHERE - THERE ARE LOTS OF GOOD HOTELS IN THE SOLVANG AREA!! 

I stayed there for three nights; and for each day/night I was there, the pool and jacuzzi area were very poorly maintained.  The pool had debris floating in it each day, the bottom was filthy, and there were never ANY towels available for myself and several other guests who were as displeased as myself.

Despite numerous complaints by myself and other guests, all that any of us received were ""I'm sorry"", and lies of how the pool was cleaned each morning (It wasn't, and the few people who did bring towels from their room and left the wet ones there in the afternoon/evening had these same towels scattered on lounges, concrete, etc. the next morning.  

My wife and I tried to use the jacuzzi and pool four (4) separate times the first two days there, and had no interest due to the lack of cleanliness (trash in pool area and around it); combined with no towels.

On the last day, I complained to the supervisor on duty named Jennifer (whom I had to go through a desk clerk named Josh who could only apologize with no corrective action). Even after that complaint, and promises of this being corrected shortly, nothing changed - and guests that evening who tried to swim or use the jacuzzi found a filthy environment and no towels.

In the morning, when checking out, the small ""compensation"" of a reduction in our hotel bill that Jennifer had promised us the night before was not provided in its entirty; the desk clerk checking us out told me how wrong I was about the credit being right (couldn't function without a calculator for simple math, and then couldn't even punch numbers right and tried to bluff her way through her multiple mistakes).  Finally, the day supervisor Milton came over, realized that there was a mistake (constantly denied by this desk clerk and telling me I was wrong), and corrected it; but even he didn't properly provide the credit that was both promised by Jennifer and even stated in the notes of our room stay.","To get a good room, find another hotel!!!",1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,,,,,77

I was concerned with the location being that it was far from home. After seeing the hotel a day before I could see why they picked this hotel. My biggest surprise was when I met Doreen the hotels catering coordinater. The day before the wedding Doreen noticed that we were puzzled about the brides bouquet, and although it was late 8pm she asked how she could help. We mentioned that it was not what the bride expected and that we wanted to help, but we did not know any local florist and that it was late. She immediately offered her help and said that she only needed white roses and she could put together a bouquet. Her goal was to see the bride happy. We immediately left to purchase some flowers and returned back by 9:30pm. She waited for us and said that she would work on it and have it ready by 8am!    The bride was not aware of this, so once Doreen showed up to her room she was so  surprised  and greatful that she wanted to cry. I have attended and organized many catering events for my   business, but I had never met someone so concerned and caring. She made this event so   memorable for the bride and groom.

Lovely spot. Lots on good wineries that are easy to get to far outweigh a town that is seemingly aimed purely at tourists. They do not let you forget you are in, apparently, ""Little Denmark"". Still. Mrs Eyes Wide Open and this reviewer went to Solvang for a wedding, and picked this hotel mainly for its location to middle of town but also, relevantly, for its reviews on Tripadvisor. Tip? To get here, US Route 101 north from Santa Barbara is quicker than the smaller, more trafficked, US Route 154, tho - in small parts - the 154 has some OK views. 

The hotel itself was, in this experienced reviewers opinion, rather underwhelming. I read the reviews, and I see the positives, but quite frankly, there is some large gaps in this hotel's resume. Especially in this price point, which was eye watering relative to the quality it delivered.  Usual format for my reviews; the room itself, the good, the not so good and the conclusion; We would not return and urge others to very picky about which rooms upfront. Some tips below.. 

The room itself? Normal. Average. Flat screen tv, decent selection of in-room TV channels (different languages), in room a/c & heating, fridge in room that was empty (a good thing in my view) Water was free (funny how that is a perk, though probably because it was sponsored by the local casino). Wall 'art' looked like a piece of balsa wood though the attempt at a feature wall was noted. Power points plentiful, tho not in the most useful places. Bathroom/Shower was modern and had good pressure: the room we had had two sinks, with one having a make up mirror. There was in room iron and board, tho no in room safe. Alarm clock had iPod/iPhone charging (not 5g compatible tho). 

The good?
1) Free wifi with decent speeds. I have written nearing 40 reviews and this is a pet peeve of mine: this hotel gets it right, tho with this price point per room, you expect it to. 
2) Location: as others have mentioned, the hotel is in the middle of town, 20 foot from Copenhagen Street. That said, 'town' is maybe 4 blocks. So walking is not exactly challenging either. In the positives column.
3) If gambling is your thing, there was a shuttle to the casino. Easily accessible. 
4) Parking is free and ample. Plenty of parking for people with disabilities too. 

The good however, were (far) outweighed by the bad, not all of it the fault of the hotel to be fair, but how they handled it - as other reviewers have commented - badly needs tightening up. 
1) Front desk was a very mixed experienced. Check in good, especially so given it was quite late. Check out was nothing special, no questions about the stay etc. Complaining about the 2 yr old screaming at midnight received very short shrift.  
2) Re check in request for one king or one queen bed not honored. Other reviews mention this too: We requested but did not receive the room: instead, two double beds. Bed comfort, for this reviewer, as a result was not great. Subjective, agreed, but this reviewer has stayed at plenty of hotels to know. 
3) Guest placement: hotels fundamentally know who they are putting in what room. You do not, for example, put a young family with very young children in an interconnecting room. Young children scream. Alot. Inter-connecting rooms have paper thin walls (and these were especially so: you could hear conversations clearly next door). Hotel did not have ear plugs (we checked). And could not move us because, apparently, they were full. A bit better foresight and planning by the hotel would save everyone hassle: simple stuff in this reviewers opinion. We asked to move the following day and hotel management, bluntly put, did not seem to care. And did not offer any options or compensation. Tip? Do NOT stay in one of their interconnected rooms. Ask to move. 
4) Room itself was noisy: as other reviews mention, the lobby - bellmen free - is loud. The above said child could be clearly heard screaming before we even got to our ground floor room. And then we discovered it was inter-connecting. Tip? Do NOT stay on the ground floor. Avoid the noise.. 
5) No 'hassle free' check out. You had to line up, wait, sort it all out and then go. Again, small thing easily fixed. 

Conclusion? I can see the merits of the hotel and that is reflected in the positive reviews: that said, those other reviews miss some obvious flaws. Which is why this reviewer would not return. The tips above may remedy some of the issues, which I would head.",,2.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,,,,299
Kelly M,341,"Killington, Vermont",2012-09-30,COUPLES,2012-10-09,4,"Sweet place to stay in this area, modern & fresh",I visited Solvang with my mother and had to stay at the Marriott years back - it  was a bit out of town so I was delighted to find Hotel Corque for this visit. The hotel is modern and a welcome surprise in this old danish town.  The lobby is inviting with high back chairs and cork decor.  The staff were helpful and attentive.  Our room was a king balcony - unfortunately we overlooked the parking lot but off to the right you could see hills.  The room was clean and bed was very comfortable while the linens were top rate - very nice.  The pool area was small but good for just hanging out and they had a hot tub which later in the afternoon as the sun went down was perfect.  Walking around town at night after dinner was romantic and fun and if you are up for a casino run the hotel offers a shuttle.  We only stayed one night but it was excellent option for this town and the area.,I would have preferred a pool view with hills as opposed to our parking lot balcony - likely would have gotten a &quot;french Door&quot; room vs. balcony had I known it had that view.  Be sure to ask - we paid $20 more for terrace which was not very inviting.,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,51
JanetSanDiego,54,,2012-10-31,FRIENDS,2012-10-07,3,This could be a nice hotel!!!,"This could be a really nice hotel. But, upon arrival there was no bellman to help us with our luggage. We were to have a room with a king bed. Instead we were given a room with two queen beds. We went back to the front desk to change rooms. The receptionist was very short with us and said there were no more king beds available and that one had never been requested.
The rooms were nicely decorated with some great lighting accents. The bathroom is nice with two separate sinks. Unfortunately the shower is leaking and there is water damage on the walls, not very pretty!! The refrigerator was so noisy that we had to unplug it to sleep. There are no safes in the room. The balconies view the parking lot and are not private. If your drapes are open your neighbor can see in your room from their balcony.  If you look past the parking lot there is a nice view of the mountains!  The room smelled of such heavy disinfectant that we had to go buy a candle.

When they told me I actually booked hotel corque, I was quite irritated. Solvang, although nice, is not really a town for a single guy. I got to hotel corque, not knowing whether I wanted to check in or not, and the person at the front desk took me up to my room before I checked in to see if I approved. She was a tremendous help. Once I checked in, the room was nice. I turned on the tv and sat in the chair near the balcony window.  Within two minutes, I had kids from the room next to me standing on their balcony staring at me. I ended up closing the drapes as I also had a horrible view. The view was of a parking lot and large tent. I went to the casino for a few hours then came back to the hotel. The room just was not comfortable. I ended checking out at midnight.  The person Checking me out wasnt too concerned about me staying, he was more concerned about figuring out how to tax me since the tax doesn't post till 3:00 am.

However that is where it stops.  Service was sorely lacking.  First, the valet was gone at 10:00pm when I checked in.  I had to park on the street almost two blocks away and carry my luggage to the hotel.  (I was bringing up a bunch of sports equipment, so it was a chore).  
The guy at the front desk seemed really bored.  There was no welcome or smile.  Just give me your credit card and he flipped me a key.
The room was very small, dark and although the furniture was modern it didn't have a lot of personality.  The room smelled like cigar smoke and stunk.  I did go back to the front desk and asked if they had another room and the very bored desk clerk barely looked up and said the hotel was full and I had the last room.
We had dinner on Sunday night in Solvang and I came back with my son to use the pool.  There was a couple in the hot tub, the woman did not have her top on and they were more than making out.  I finally got up (as there were other young kids in the pool) and went to the front desk.  The girl basically said ""there is nothing I can do about it"".
The hotel felt a little dirty.  There was a lot of dust on the tables in the lobby and the carpet looked like it had not been cleaned in a while.
Although the hotel tries hard to be cool and hip it needs to follow through with the staff and keeping up with keeping it clean and fresh.",,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,,,,,1073

They were unhelpful to the point of being arrogant and were anything but accomodating. Please refer to my past review of this hotel. This time, it was worse. My partner and I decided to give the place a second chance and we booked two nights for our Anniversary. We each had our own discount coupon and so we booked the two nights separately. We spoke to Katie who absolutely agreed to allow us to stay in the same room for the two nights. We emphasized this repeatedly and she assured us repeatedly that there would be no issue. We spent the first night in a very nice room, we had requested the mountain side. The next morning when I went down to check back in on my coupon and credit card we were told we had to move to a ""lesser"" room. Our level room was not available anymore. We explained that we were told this was not going to happen and that we had unpacked and had slept in late...to no avail. Basically, take what they are giving us or we can check out and leave. We were moved to a room on the busy street side with all kinds of traffic and restaurant noise. I asked for the manager and was sent over to the Chumash Resort to see someone named Nino. He was not in that day and instead we were met by the assistant manager, Alan. He listened to our complaints from both stays and was very understanding and apologetic...even hinting that we would be ""taken care of"" due to their poor customer service. I have been to many of the major hotel chains and when we have had a legitmate complaint, we are usually comped a night or given some type of discount or meal coupon...something to say that we are valued customers. Alan informed us he would speak to Jim, the Hotel Corque manager and phone us later that night. We wasted most of that day trying to get what was rightly ours and what was promised to us. At nearly nine that night, Alan phoned to say that Jim was very sorry and that for our trouble they would give us....AN UPGRADED ROOM ON OUR NEXT STAY??? So basically the only compensation we were going to get was if we decided to give them more money to be treated just as poorly? My family has been in the travel business for over thirty years and this is just not how you treat guests...no matter how much they are paying.

Peregrinator_7,80,,2011-10-31,COUPLES,2012-02-11,4,Cute Boutique Hotel walking distance to town,"Booked this small little boutique hotel for a weekend in October for a wedding in Solvang, and it was recommended by the bride.  

Pros: 
-We were a little early to check-in, but they were able to give us our room immediately.  The room was on the 2nd floor facing the front of the hotel.
-The room was clean and nicely decorated (I posted some photos).
-The hotel is in walking distance to the cute town of Solvang, shopping, spas, wine tasting, restaurants, and sites.  Nice view of the mountains.
-Access to the elevators require guest keys, so that seemed like a nice security feature.
-Beds are comfortable, however I had a little bit of trouble sleeping with the fluff of the pillows.
-When we called the housekeeper for toothpaste, they came within 2-3 minutes with one.
-had internet access
-Check out was quick and efficient

Cons: 
-There is no fitness center or spa in the hotel, but the hotel attempts to make up for it by having a shuttle bus that transports guests every half hour to the fitness center and spa at a nearby casino.  I opted to jog outside and go to a nearby spa down the street to get my nails done for the wedding.  
-You can hear through the walls, but it was more of people walking around than loud noises or conversations.
-Numerous ads about the nearby casino seemed like too much for me

We stayed in the wine country suite- we actually stayed in 2 different suites as the first night we were next to a large group of women in the room next door. We could hear every word they were saying. The first room was one large open suite with the sitting area in the bedroom, a large bathroom with a jetted tub and separate shower and toilet area. Our second suite was their 2nd type of suite which has 2 rooms- a separate living area and a separate bedroom plus 2 full bathrooms with showers but no tub. Although we liked our first room, the 2nd room did not disappoint. Their suites are spacious and the bed was comfortable. We usually stay at the Santa Ynez Inn which is similiarly priced, but it was booked. I  prefer Santa Ynez Inn for even money as their rooms are gorgeous and the bathrooms are the best I have seen in my travels. Corque is contemporary- Santa Ynez is victorian so they are  two  completely different styles.

Angelscry21,59,"Westlake Village, California",2012-01-31,COUPLES,2012-01-29,4,Corque vs. Hadsten House,"My husband and I visit Solvang at least once a year to go to the different wineries and tasting rooms around the area. We've stayed at Hadsten House in the past, as well as a few other motels in Solvang. From reading other reviews it seems like many times it comes down to Corque v. Hadsten House on who is the reigning accommodation. So here is my personal opinion after just coming back from Hotel Corque and previous stays at HH......

Corque

When pulling up to hotel corque, I like that it aesthetically looks like a boutique hotel. Conversely, when pulling up to HH, it appears like a motel on the outside because frankly it is (or was...depending on who you ask). 

Customer service at Corque was great with one glitch. Although they were able to check us in 1 hr before regular check in time, they did not tell us ahead of time that they were giving us a handicapped room. When the woman told us a room was ready, I would've appreciated the preference of taking the handicapped room or waiting for a non-handicapped room to be ready. Since we were only staying one night, I decided to just deal with it. However, besides that, the lady was very nice and even called Tastes of the Valley for us to find out what time they closed on a Tuesday night. Costumer service at Hadsten House was also great. They had a cheese and fruit plate and wine upon our arrival.

Corque's lobby is beautiful and modern and I love the huge lighting fixture over the large chairs and fireplace. HH's ""lobby"" is more of a quaint little room, but still adorable. Corque's rooms are simplistic and modern and the bathrooms are updated. I know reviewers talk about the bathrooms having double sinks, but ours did not, which I was really looking forward to and was disappointed to see we only had one. I don't know if it was because we had a basic room or because it was handicapped. Either way, the sink was minuscule and there was a tiny table literally 2ft x 2ft to put all my makeup, toiletries etc on. Not practical for today's woman (handicapped or not). HH's rooms are also nice as well and have a more personal, romantic feel inside. The king size bed was absolutely heavenly to sleep in. And the fake fireplace they have is kitchy, a bit corny, but if youre able to not take yourself too seriously and just go with the flow, it'll grow on you. The walls, however, at HH are VERY thin. So keep this in mind if you are there celebrating an anniversary or something with the loved one ::wink wink::

We wanted to try Root 246 for lunch and when I went on their website, they had a fabulous signature Reuben sandwich that I knew my husband would kill for. However, when we got there, the menu had changed and no Reuben was to be found. Since the lunch options were sooo limited, we just went elsewhere to satisfy my husband's Reuben craving. I have heard fabulous reviews of Root 246 and will definitely try it next time we go. The restaurant attached to HH is pleasantly surprising. It feels very intimate, modern and dark and the menu rivals great american steakhouses in LA or SF.  Definitely a must. 

Regarding complimentary breakfast at Corque, I didn't see any and the concierge lady did not mention one, so I assume they have discontinued it. The complimentary breakfast at HH was also great, considering most free breakfasts consist up cereal boxes, aired out pastries and apples and oranges. HH's complimentary breakfast had eggs, bacon, biscuits, oatmeal etc. Taste wise it wasn't the best breakfast of my life, but definitely satisfying and very fulfilling. However, when staying in Solvang, you MUST go to Paula's Pancake House at least one of those mornings. Danish pancakes are oh so satisfying!

So overall, which would I choose? It's a toss up. I love the location of Corque better, but I love the feel of the rooms at HH better and the free breakfast and cheese/fruit plate sealed the deal. Yet, right now Travelzoo has Corque at only $89/night whereas HH is about $50 more a night during non-crushing season. 

We plan on going back up in March and will probably stay at Corque because of price and location. But when I think back to the times I stayed at both places, HH stands out more in my mind, despite the motel appearance on the outside and thin walls. 

Hope this review helped!",Ask for a room on the top floor so that you don&#39;t hear people above and below you.,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,76

Yesssss!!!!,"My husband and I were wine tasting in Northern Santa Barbara county with some friends this past weekend and spent 1 night at Hotel Corque in Solvang. What a gem of a hotel! The lobby is large and open with a beautiful fireplace as the focal point. Oversized chairs are placed in front of the fireplace for guest's comfort. Check in was speedy and the staff was very nice. Our room was on the first floor with a view of the swimming pool. The room was huge and decorated beautifully. There is a sitting area with a couch and chair, and a desk. The bed was so comfy and the linens were luxurious. I'm really finicky about hotel beds and this one ranks very high in my book! The bathroom was extremely spacious with 2 sinks, a separate toilet area, huge bathtub and separate shower. What I loved about the shower was the rain shower head and the flooring, which was a smooth stone surface. The towels were huge and soft. Very lovely! There is a coffee maker in the room for those who need their coffee immediately upon waking. When we got back to our room after dinner, our bed had been turned down and bottles of water were left on the side tables-a very nice touch!
There is not an in house restaurant at Hotel Corque, but conveniently located next door is a restaurant called Root 246 that serves breakfast, lunch and dinner and has a bar. Room service is available and our friends ordered room service and said it was delicious. We opted to go out for breakfast. Solvang isn't that big, but the hotel is located in an area close to shopping and restaurants and bakeries. We walked to breakfast and window shopped around town.

We couldn't be happier that we chose to stay a couple miles off the freeway in Solvang instead of staying in Buellton. The location of Hotel Corque is perfect. It's on the edge of town, about 1 block off the main road. It feels private and intimate, but everything in town is within walking distance. It's also adjacent to Bradley Ogden's restaurant, Root 246.

The hotel was recently renovated and they did an amazing job. Everything feels brand new and updated, but with the character of a classic lodge. The rooms were spacious and the beds, with headboards that looked like something from the Mad Hatter, were extremely comfortable. Nice bathrooms too. Everything was well appointed and every staff member that we met was friendly and outgoing. We stayed on the first floor, close to the lobby, and did not have any noise issues. 

We stayed on a Thursday and got a great rate. As we were checking out, I overheard that their rates for Friday were more than twice what we paid. Ouch!

TPSGrad,1,,2011-11-30,COUPLES,2011-11-14,2,Overpriced,"We stayed here as part of a wedding and got a discount ($199 per night). We arrived slightly early at about 12:00 pm and were told that they might have a room ready for us in the next 30 minutes as long as we didn't mind staying on the first floor. I asked them if all the rooms were the same and they said yes. Since I needed to change and a place for my wife and baby to stay before going to some of the wedding events, I just elected to go ahead and get the room.

I thought the room was nice but nothing extra special. It wasn't until I went to a few of the other rooms in our wedding party that I realized the rooms were most definitely NOT the same. Pretty much everyone else had a room with a balcony or patio and a view of the mission or the pool. I had a view of the parking lot and no balcony or patio. I went to the front desk and asked why I had been told the rooms were the same, since they clearly weren't, and I was told that even though we were paying the same price, people were placed into different styles of rooms based on what the hotel coordinator felt like doing and we still had to pay the same amount since it was at the discounted rate. Additionally, he told me that we were basically lucky because that room usually goes for $350 per night. For a view of the parking lot, really? 

The hotel was exceptionally clean, there was no cost for parking, and it was located in the heart of downtown Solvang. The staff at the tables in the lobby (concierge, I guess) always looked tired and had no problem slouching in their chairs with the look of ""I don't care"" on their faces. Plus, the maids spoke MINIMAL English which made it extremely difficult to simply get someone to clean my room. The front desk staff was somewhat helpful but not what I expected at that price.

Overall, my wife and I enjoyed our time in such a beautiful town but would not stay at this hotel again. Save your money and stay at the Holiday Inn Express or something equivalent then spend your money having fun. This hotel is nice but the price and staff need some serious work.",,1.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,,,3

Decor- Spectacular from the moment you arrive. The lobby is beautiful and comfortable with a comfy fireplace. The rooms are well done, too. Comforting and a great attention to details.
Bathroom-  2 great sinks, a comfortable shower with a super shower head, nice soaps, shower gel, etc., many puffy towels, unique lighting reflect nicely on this great bathroom.  
Other ammenities- Super large screen HD TV with an adequate # of channels. Bed and bedding were as good as it gets. Refrigerator (no microwave).  room was very clean
Pewrsonnel- Lobby personnel were extremely helpfulwith information about the town and surrounding area.  Even had a few coupons.
They are connected with a casino (buses leave about every 30 minutes) for about a less than 10 minute trip. High class casino with some good entertainment and an inexpesive fabulous buffet.
One small negative would be hearing footsteps from thje room above, but nothing from either side. Also, they do not have an exercise facility on the premises.

The first time we stayed here we got in way before check-in time. They couldn't let us check in early because they didn't have a room ready, but the gal at the check-in desk set us up with a ton of tasting coupons so that we could go check out the town while we waited for our room to be ready. When we finally got back to check in, we fell in love with the room right away. The bed is super comfy, the bathroom is awesome (especially the shower), and it's beautifully decorated. We had an amazing view of the Santa Ynez mountains from the balcony - great spot to sit with a glass of wine and we took full advantage. The continental breakfast was nothing extraordinary but there are a lot of little eateries in Solvang that we wanted to take advantage of so that wasn't a concern for us. I can't comment on the pool because we haven't used it. The location is fantastic - within walking distance of everything in Solvang and a quick 5-7 minute drive to Los Olivos which is where all our favorite wineries and tasting rooms are. They also have a free shuttle to Chumash Casino that runs 24 hours. I will say we haven't paid full price any of the times we've visited here, and I'm not sure I would. We booked through Travelzoo the first time we went and paid $75/ night on a weekend which is far less than their typical rate. I've looked into going other times and found their non-discounted rates to be pretty extreme. The budget traveler in me would look elsewhere during peak rates, but anytime I see a good rate I will be booking us a trip to Hotel Corque.",,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,,,18
brit_chick98,31,,2011-10-31,COUPLES,2011-10-11,3,"Nice and tidy, but lacking in amenities","We stayed at this hotel as we were attending a wedding close to Solvang.  We were originally assigned a disabled room (no idea why) and when we asked to move they did move us without any problems and said they upgraded us - I think an upgrade constituted a view of the pool?  We ended up in room 307 which was nice and comfortable.  

The hotel was modern, clean and tidy but what let it down was the lack of amenities.  We arrived late on Friday only to find that room service finishes at 9pm - the entire town was basically shut down so we couldn't get any food.  When i called the front desk I was told to drive to the nearby casino if we wanted to eat - not helpful after you've been in the car for 5 hours already.  We went to bed hungry.  

The closet had plenty of hangers and the bed was comfortable, there was also a fridge in the room but not mini-bar.  There was no gym - again, you were directed to the casino for that - too much work and you had to pay!!   There was a pool though with some nice outdoor seating.  The location was great, it was right down-town so you could walk about.  If you like ice cream and pastries you were all set, good luck finding a club sandwich and a diet coke though!  No doubt you would need to go to the casino for that too!  ;0)    That's Solvang for you though, not necessarily this hotel...

We ordered breakfast in our room the next day - because there is no restaurant attached to the hotel (it's next door) it was cold by the time it got to us, but it wasn't bad.  We asked for wheat toast which they told us they did for us as an exception as they don't normally do that.  Who doesn't offer wheat toast for breakfast?  They forgot my tea, so we had to call back and have them bring that.  They also told us our soda was coming but that it would be flat because the machine had no ice...?!  Urm, what?!  At $21 or $23 per person, plus tip, tax and delivery - a $60+ cold breakfast...hmmm

At $230 a night (discounted wedding rate) this was an expensive hotel all things considered.  As I say, it wasn't bad, it just wasn't great, it was just okay.   I don't know how this compared to some of the other Best Western type hotels in the downtown area though?  Maybe compared to them this was amazing?

VanNuys1,16,,2011-09-30,FRIENDS,2011-09-12,4,Could have been Four Stars if only......,"Arrived at the Hotel Corque on Sat. afternoon 09/10/11.  We were staying overnight for a wedding being held at the Firestone Vineyard in nearby Los Olivos.  This hotel had previously been a Fess Parker property and had been purchased by the Chumash Casino people.  They had refurbished the hotel and it looked great from the outside.  The exterior was clean, well manicured and inviting.  The hotel offers valet parking at no charge, but when you drive up there are no signs to tell you that and if the valets are busy and no one is at their podium, you have no way of knowing.  Self parking is available everywhere.  
The lobby was spotless, comfortable and inviting.  Besides a small check in/check out counter, there are also two concierge desks that do check in/check out as well.  That feature is very helpful during busy times.
There is a nice gratis coffee/tea bar in the lobby as well as many local publications on the area and its vineyards.  The Santa Barbara daily newspaper is stacked and available.
You must use your electronic room key to access the elevators in the lobby.  Personally, I welcome this extra bit of security, however one can easily access the door to the stairwell a few feet away without a key.
Hallways were spacious, clean and quiet.
Room was a king sized bed, nice flat screen t.v., refrigerator, desk, lamps etc.  Four bottles of drinking water gratis was a nice touch.  
Bathroom was great.  Two seperate sinks across from each other, plenty of soft towels, a large glass enclosed shower with, get this, STRONG SHOWER SPRAY!!!  Nice soaps and amenities also.
The Sat. we were there, the hotel was sold out with both young and older guests.  We were concerned with late night noise as there were many people staying in the hotel that were attending different wedding parties that evening.  We got back to our room around 1:00 am and didn't hear anything in our hallway the rest of the night.  That was GREAT! 
Kudos for a quiet hotel. Check out was no problem the next morning.

I would have given the hotel 4 stars except for some problems.
1.  The wedding we were attending was supplying large charter busses to take guests to and 
     and from the hotel.  The busses were making rounders at different times so that people
     could leave the hotel and head to the wedding site over a 3 hour period. 
     Upon questioning the hotel lobby staff about the bus service, they seemed lost and not 
     informed.  I then asked the valets outside about the bus service and they said ""the bus
     only comes once for the wedding party and then once more for the hotel guests."" 
     That sounded strange so when the bus come back I questioned the driver and got the 
     proper answer and schedule.  I feel that the hotel staff should know these things.  This 
     bus thing takes place all the time with different weddings taking place at different 
     vineyards.

 2. Apparently there was a private continental breakfast for the guests of the wedding we 
     attended.  The continental breakfast was on the 2nd floor of the hotel.  We were never
     informed by the staff during check out nor was there any signage to that fact in the lobby, 
     elevators or outside the front doors.  Needless to say, we left and found a cafe' on the 
     way home for some coffee and pastries.

I would recommend this hotel (even though a bit pricey) to friends looking to stay in Solvang.  The hotel is very convienient to all of downtown.

I don't care that there is not a restaurant, because you go to Paula's Pancakes for breakfast (awesome) and the Root 246 restaurant just next door is supposed to be excellent. We had cheese and wine there and it was expertly presented. My only concern was that when we checked in, we were given a first floor room with no view, just the parking lot, but when we asked for a higher room, right away they switched us. I heard this happened to a friend of mine as well. I wrote to the general manager to compliment him on everything good, and to ask about this. He called me right away and we had a pleasant conversation. He said the front desk can only offer rooms that are proven ready, and that new rooms show up constantly as being ready. I suggested that the front desk could give guests the option of checking in to a less-good room right away, or waiting some length of time for a better one. The difference in the view was such that I would have been happy to walk around or get a glass of wine next door.

We were awakened at 12:30 am, 2:00 am, and had noisy, and drunken bridal party goers in the hallway and in the room next door until 3:30 am. Since we were getting away for a one precious night without our children, we were very upset by this and complained to the front desk. They did compensate us by giving us 10% off the rate, but this hardly made up for the lack of serenity we had hoped for at 2 am. They also shared with us that the hotel was very popular for weddings- one there almost every single weekend. This would make me think twice about booking a room here.

lakotalisa,28,,2011-07-31,COUPLES,2011-07-27,4,Beautiful views but management needs help.,"The Corque is owned and operated by the Chumash Casino Resort and the first thing I would advise is that you try to get a Chumash Passport from the casino with the free room upgrade...if one is available when you check in.  I would also advise that you join the Players Club and book through them as you can get some great deals. This is not a boutique hotel. But it is certainly extremely clean and if you get a room facing the rear of the property, there are some great views. Solvang is right out the door so you can leave your car and walk the town.

We were advised to go do something like take in a movie. I informed them that I had a broken foot  and that I could not walk around and they still would not oblige us with a room. So we sat on a street bench for two hours people watching. When we returned at 4:00, the room they had for us was STILL not ready. We were informed that they had been booked out the previous night.

The next person assured me that all I had to do was bring in the coupons, the people and IDs in order to use them.  The first night was fine ($59), they remembered to put in that we had a coupon and their was no problems other than the bathroom didn't have a working lock and the room was not as clean as I would have liked. (public hair on the floor and toilet paper holder was what really grossed me out) 

The second night however, we had to talk to the supervisor because apparently no one had put in the information that we were bringing a coupon even though I had double checked to ensure they had. The supervisor was INCREDIBLY RUDE and not empathetic in the slightest.

The desk staff were polite enough, but we had several bags and I did not even SEE any bell staff at all, nevermind get any offer of assistance.

A ""hot tub"" with no jacuzzi jets (kinda creepy).  A business center with 1997-speed internet - no WiFi or even an ethernet cable jack in the room. You'd think for $239/night, you'd at least get HBO, pool towels, jacuzzi jets, and a decent internet connection...but no.  The biggest shocker for me with this hotel charging $239/night is that we were part of a wedding group...and the mother of the bride was running around trying to make sure everyone got a welcome bag...I found out later that she was doing this because the Hotel Corque (who was charging all of us $239 per night per room mind you) refused to peform the simple task of distributing these bags unless she paid a $4 PER BAG fee!!!!",,1.0,1.0,3.0,,,4.0,,,,,1

We stayed here many years ago when it was called the Royal Scandavian Inn.  Solvang does not have a lot of large hotels, so this one is larger.  It's 3 stories and has over 100 rooms.  I went back last summer with a group of girlfriends and, from the site, thought were staying at a new swanky boutique hotel.  Particularly for the price (approx. $350), I expected a little more.  Once I arrived, I realized it was the hold Radisson-esque hotel I had stayed at nearly 10 years before, just with a new paint job and more modern furniture.  The bare bones of the place still looks a bit dated.  Regardless, it served its purpose and, as opposed to other accommodations in the area, is modern, which is a plus for me.  It was enough of a plus that I decided to stay there again this past weekend (price this time was lower, likely due to the season).

Breakfast is free and available in a self-serve ""hospitality suite"" on the second floor.  Basically, a table set up with bagels, toast, cereal, fruit, juice, and coffee.  Nothing fancy, but I suppose adequate if you're in a rush and don't want a full sitdown breakfast.  The sign on the door said that the hotel is discontinuing breakfast in the near future, and will be available through somewhere else for $17-21/pp.  The hotel does not have room service, but does offer a delivery service of boxed meals during limited hours.

The hotel is located behind the Mission and at the beginning of the cute town.  It's a much better location than Hadsten.  The lobby was beautiful.  Modern, but with a cabin/lodge feel to it.  The rooms were clean and updated, and the bathrooms great as well.  Our room had a nice view, but we did face the parking lot.  No big deal.

The rooms are comfortable, renovated, and spacious. The lobby is interesting. Not quite as warm as a typical boutique hotel. We had some problems with our reservations. I understand the hotel used to have another name and it was recently purchased by the same people who own the local casino. There was a discrepancy with the room price. The internet price was actually higher than when I called reservations. This is unusual. The internet showed availability for the type of rooms there were not actually available. When we checked in they had a different price for our room from our reservation price. It took a while to get it resolved.
Our biggest complaint is the noise level from the street. They have a shuttle that goes between the hotel to the casino and vice versa. It goes all day and night. People congregated right below the rooms' windows and were very loud and drunk. Hard to fall asleep. If you stay there, make sure to get a room away from the street.
Also, they have a restaurant next door that they own. It's Root 246.

What was available with 10 days notice was very expensive and not high up on the recommendation list. However, there is a gem of a hotel in the Danish village of Solvang located about 30 miles North North East of Santa Barbara. This is the Hotel Corque. A recent restoration was nicely done and the hotel amenities were what a family with two teenagers was looking for in a great place. The pool is superb, the rooms are arranged with nice beds, flat screen TVs and bathrooms taken off interior design magazines.

The room (room 248) was clean and furnishings were nice, but the layout of the room just did not make sense to use.  The bed faced the sliding glass door.  I assume this was so we could enjoy the nice view from the bed.  However, the view was of the other side of the hotel, a poolhouse in the poolyard and the pool and a little bit of view of the pretty hills behind.  There was a couch that faced the bed and then a TV that you could not see from the couch and had to lay on your side to view from the bed.  The view of the hills and the TV would have been much better if the bed was on the next wall over.  Also, there is a big window covered only by retractable shutters from the bathroom into the bedroom.  I assume this is to enjoy the nice view from the bathroom also.  However, only the sink was situated behind the window, not the bathtub.  It would make more sense to have a nice view from the bathtub, right?  This also compromises your privacy in the bathroom.  Even if you've been with your SO for a long time, you'd still like a few minutes of privacy every day!  The bathtub was TINY.  I have heard tubs in other rooms are bigger, but we paid for the suite so expected something nicer.  Overall, the hotel is nice, he service friendly, the bed comfy and I think if we have been on the third floor it would have been a nicer view (we asked to change rooms but they didn't have any others), but paying $250 a night for the view of tourists in the pool and a little bit of nice hill was not really worth it for us for a strangely appointed room with a small bathtub.
One plus, the restaurant that is part of the hotel is awesome.  Root 246...try it!  Also, the hotel is within walking distance to all the Solvang shops and tasting rooms.  I would recommend this to friends, but with some reservations and explanations.",,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,,,,,1

You get guest passes to the local gym nearby which is not great but at least has plenty of equipment.  We had a nice porch that was a great place to sit in the early morning.  Only complaints are the breakfast is terrible so don't expect much and some of the people who stay there are interesting.  It seems the hotel gives a lot of free nights to the casino frequenters.

This time we were on the 2nd floor facing the main st., Alisal Rd.  No balcony, but we did have a set of French doors opening onto a wrought iron railing.  There was no road noise.  The recepttionist said this room had a ""tree-top view"" and indeed, it did.
I'm the ""slots"" gambler, and take the hotel's shuttle to the casino, leaving my husband happy to enjoy the view and the large screen TV for the evening.   
We've only had ONE mildly unpleasant experience.  We were on the second floor and there was a family above whose little children ran and jumped quite a bit until 9:00 p.m.  If it had gone on later we would have called the desk.
The hotel is located very near some nice shops.  My favorite is directly across the street called The Home Connection.  Beautiful shop with gifts for yourself, weddings, birthdays, babies, wine buffs, gourmet cooks, etc.  They gift wrap and ship too.

We were first given a room that was not to our liking -  it overlooked the parking lot. We returned to the front desk to nicely point that out and reminded the desk clerk that we had made the reservations a month prior and paid more for a room that overlooked Santa Ynez/Mission/Mountain view as stated on their website.  We were very nicely accomodated and moved. We thought. Cue to the next morning. But wait.....Did the new room have a view of the above? Well, no not exactly....we were more overlooking the pool - but I liked the corner privacy until the next morning............when realized we had the room directly over the 2nd floor continental breakfast public gathering patio. Not private. Not fun. A group sitting below us scooching their metal patio chairs and with a perfect view of us in our Hotel Corque white robes sipping coffee and reading our travel brochures. Ewwwww.

My husband and I had planned this trip to do wine tasting. We travel 2500 miles to do it.
We specifically wanted a nice hotel room that had a blacony so that we could share one of the nice bottles of wine we would be purchasing from the areas wineries after a day of wine tasting. In the morning, we were looking forward to the nice crisp CA morning to sit out on the balcony and have our coffee.  So when we saw on their website that there was balconies with views of the mission and Santa Ynez mountains it was a no brainer to book here even though we usually stay at the Wine Valley Inn.  So that is why we were just a bit disappointed in the location of our room.

It was a nice, modern room with a funky bed that was very comfortbale and a cool bathroom with not only separate sinks - but on opposite sides of the bathroom.

Yvette S,25,"Wake Forest, North Carolina",2009-12-31,FAMILY,2010-01-28,1,"Could Have Been Lovely, But The Bed Bug Bites Killed It!","The reason I gave this hotel a terrible rating is because after staying there two nights right before New Year's, I came home with a chest full of bed bug bites.  The bites were horrible and itchy for weeks and even now, you can still see some light discoloration of my skin from the bites.
When I awoke the morning of our departure, I had several bites, but they had not begun to itch or turn red and bumpy.  The day after we got home the bites were really beginning to appear and it took several days for all the bites to show up.
I called the hotel, as I just wanted to inform them what happened.  The guest relations rep was pretty ambivalent and didn't even ask what room number we were in.  I had to offer our room number right before we hung up.  I made it clear that I had not slept in any bed other than my own at home.  And as I've never had bed bugs before of since, I is clear, I was bitten during my second night stay.  Their response was very disappointing and needless to say, we will return to our usual Hadsten House for future stays.
As far as the hotel review, we stayed in a Santa Ynez room which was on the backside, overlooking the hills.
The room was of average size. Nicely decorated in a clean, modern theme. The room offered coffee, cocoa, tea and water. There was a small fridge which we unplugged due to the noise it made. There was a very limited amount of tv channels availabe. For a hotel like this, the offering should be satellite. The beds and pillows were on the hard side. Out of five stars - they get a 3, barely. 
The bathroom was nice, with two separate vanities. The shower was on the small side and there was no tub, which is fine with us. The vanity products were nice and the towels were soft.
A couple of things were wrong in the room that needed to be addressed. Someone had messed with the tv and cables and the remote would not operate it. This should be checked by staff when someone checks out as there are jerks that love to mess with the tv and radio's before they leave.
Also, both lights over the sinks were not working. Again, this is an item a guest should not have to call about. And what with the lovely lights they use in hotels now, you need all the light you can get.
The morning continental breakfast was just average. Standard fare of muffins, boxed cerals, standard fruit, coffee and tea.
We ordered room service one night from the attached restaurant - Root 246 - and the dishes came unattractively wrapped in foil. I've never seen room service presented that way. There was no silverware, salt, pepper or butter for the rolls. By the time we got the silverware, our soups were cold. See my review about the restaurant attached to the hotel - Route 246. We found the restaurant to be very over rated. 
If it wasn't for the bed bugs, I'd rate this hotel 4, but it is really more like a 3 1/2. I would not have been happy had we paid what the rooms were going for the day we checked in, which was about $250.00. I actually like the Hadsten House more - but they aren't in the best location and the rates happened to be higher when I booked this stay. If the Hadsten House was offered at the same rate - I would have stayed there.",,3.0,3.0,,4.0,3.0,4.0,,,,,87

We booked the most basic room which was recently remodelled (exactly like the internet pictures) and very comfortable.  Breakfast the next morning was more than adequate and service was attentive.  At least 2 other travellers I met in the elevator were equally impressed.
We ate dinner (well, appetizers and desserts) on the heated patio at Root 246 next door. It was delicious and Juan was one of the best waiters we'd had in years. Also, the turndown service (complete with chocolates) was a nice touch upon our return.
A note about Solvang...it was very picturesque and quaint, but I doubt I could ever spend more than one day there.  I'm 42 and I'm quite sure my mother would enjoy all the little knick knack shops more than I did.  Lets just say, if you enjoy Thomas Kinkade paintings you'll be in seventh heaven.  Also, a pastry (or two) from one of the bakeries is definitely worth the calories.

It was large and had plenty of room.  The staff was very friendly and I saw them out at the pool and overall just paying attention to their guests.

You could spend one whole day shopping in town and then a couple more going to wine tasting in the area.  It was amazing, and a beautiful drive to get there.  My only warning is if you are driving from LA, make sure you stop in Santa Barbara because there is not much between Solvang and Santa Barbara, and it's about 20 miles in between.

Instead of a run down, danish hotel, we enjoyed a modern, clean and up-to-date hotel.  It is exactly what Solvang needed.  The staff was extremely nice and even gave us an upgrade on one of the rooms for her birthday.  The rooms were big, clean and had modern amenties.  A nice change from the typical run down hotels you find in Solvang. The location is walking distance to the all the shops and restuarants in town.  They have a pool and jazcuzzi that is open until 11am.   All in all, we were extremely impressed and will definitely stay there again.

He values the income from the bar more than from the guests (actually I think he figures he already has their money). When I spoke to the front desk I was told complaints would do no good, they simply ""don't care"" (that's a quote, not my own spin). They're booked all the time in spite of being pretty lousy hotel, so why would they I suppose.

Well, we went out and returned around 3:00 p.m., and the room still had not been cleaned.  We finally just went to the service desk and got our own clean towels, etc.  Very disappointing!

Also, don’t go to Cabernet Bistro on Alisal!  The food is delicious, but they sneak in a 25% undeserved tip!  The service is very slow, and one of the staff was extremely rude too.  We wouldn’t have minded such a generous tip if perhaps there was a group – but this was for just my husband and I – and they didn’t post it or forewarn us they would do this – it just appeared on the bill.

As for this particular hotel I am fairly picky and I thought it was fine.   Clean enough although I did see a bug one day on the wall - I chalked that up to the very cold weather.   I didn't find the usual problems in vacation hotels.  In other words no hair in the tub that wasn't mine, no starchy towels from too many linens crammed into the washing machines...

The best thing about this is the location.  You can walk right up to various shops and the bakeries and restaurants are very near also.   I felt very restful here.

The restaurant looked a little bleak and there is so many great places to eat around town that  we did not eat there, however we had room service which turned out to be very good (simple but good burgers+some chocolate desert). The wine tour was great (even if the picnic was skimpy but that's not the hotel's fault). We went to 4 wineries and rode in a nice strech limo with another couple from another hotel.
The pool was nice HOWEVER if you are a couple looking for a quiet time around the pool/jacuzzi, it's probably not the right place for you. Lots and lots of children, young and old playing and screaming at all hours around the pool. That was a bummer as  it was quite hot.

Earlier in the year, we learned a new owner, Chumash had bought the property.  Since acquiring it, they were gradually fixing the property up. After about a year, you expect it right?

The room looks identical as the previous year: same comforter cover, carpet, wall paper, furniture...ugh. (I like Danish theme but change is good here.)  No major wear issues, carpet is reasonably free of spot/stains. Bathroom is clean a few marks on the tile but not ugly. Tiles are free of mold/mildew no odors.    

BUT the flippin A/C again. Lucky this year was again mild so the hottest it was was mid-80's. ""A new A/C unit was installed last week"". Like previous years, maintenance was up to our room in multiples attempting to get it working.  Sadly, it didn't.  The Meadows Restaurant also had this issue and was closed one day.  The next day is was blowing cold,  Yay! Our room...nay.

Staff was helpful and accommodating. After a maintenance visit, someone from the front desk would call to verify if it was ok.  What can you say when the it isn't but they do have service in mind. :)

Had two meals at the Meadows Restaurant and like past...consistent and good. Order turn-around was typical, about 8-10 minutes wait. The young waitress was friendly, bubbly and it made the mornings pleasant to see such enthusiasm.

We decided to try the Royal Scandinavian because of the price and location. Being from the Las Vegas area, we do expect a bit more from hotels/resorts, but this place suited our needs just fine.

While the property itself isn't too particularly impressive, the area and price is just right. We would wake up every morning and walk to one of the nearby restaurants for breakfast. (try the aebleskevers)

The rooms are clean, roomy, but nothing to really right home about. The hotel makes for a great base while exploring the area.

Two nights in Solvang is great for a nice getaway. Spend one day walking around town, sampling wines, and browsing the antique shops. It's great having the hotel so close to the main drag, so you can either drop off items your wife has bought or take a little break.

Spend another day taking a fantastic drive around the area. The vinyards, berry farms, horse ranches, and even an ostrich farm can take all day to visit. But a fantastic day for two.

We're planning on returning this month for another getaway. 

Looking forward to it.

Service: The hotel staff is very friendly and helpful. Our check-in process was speedy. When I asked them for recommendations on wineries and places to visit, they spent a good amount of time pointing each one out on a map for me.

Decor: The hotel was very beautiful during Christmas time. They had fancy Christmas trees in the lobby and one on each floor by the elevator. They have a lifesize gingerbread house and fire in the fireplace. The room is brightly decorated with yellow linen and scandinavian furniture. It makes you feel like you're really in Denmark.

Room: For a 3 star rating, I was very impressed with the quality of the room. The furniture is very nice and comfortable. My family complained about the pillows being too soft, but other than that, they were impressed with it. The bathrooms was clean and the water pressure was fine.

Amenities: When you check into the hotel, there is coffee and hot tea waiting for you. They are also available in your room. The hotel also has free wifi and a computer in the lobby. 

Restaurant: The Meadows Restaurant is located right next to the Hotel and has different themed nights. There is live entertainment and music on weekends and different deals for weekdays. 

Distance: This hotel is just steps away from any Danish bakery or souvenir stores. It is located in the heart of Solvang, so once you park in the hotel lot, you won't have to find anymore parking.

I noticed that on the Air Conditioning, it says it has a sensor that detects that you are not in the room so it will turn itself off. maybe that is why some of the other reviewers I have read here had trouble with the Temperature. I did have to get up at 3.00am and turn it down as it was stuffy and warm. but other than that, the beds were very nice. The meadows restaurant next door that the hotel uses for your complimentary breakfast is very expensive for dinner and the service is just so so. the restaurant was almost empty on the Thursday evening we were there, and at $28 for a small Filet Mignon, I can understand why. Perhaps they should lower their prices weekdays and that might fill up the place with the tourists that look for other cheaper places in town. Other than that, I would recomend this Hotel to other travellers.

Sharonae,18,,,,2006-08-21,4,A pleasant hotel and excellent location,"We've stayed here on two occasions for a total of four nights and have found it very pleasant.  The rooms and public areas are in very good condition.  There is no restaurant in the hotel, but Solvang is known for its food so a short walk [as close as across the parking lot] is perfectly fine.  Quiet, tidy, and comfortable with convenient parking around the hotel all make for an enjoyable stay.

We stayed in room 350 which cost $ 149.00 a night with the AAA discount. This room has a view of the Pool and Mountains very nice room with double queen beds. The room was clean and very nicely kept up. The decor was fitting, the bed a little on the stiff side but even though I have a badback I had no aches in the morning. This Room has a balcony in which you can sit out and take in the views. As mention in another write up I found no bugs or chocolate covered lamp shades, the room was very clean . Another thing I like about the hotel is that it is very close walking distance to the main shopping area of Solvang and to many resturants including there very own the Meadows resturant . I would gladly stay here again and would rate the Hotel and reception staff a close to 4 star rating. One more thing to mention was that my in-laws stayed in room 343 and also like it very much this room has a single king bed with no balcony or pool view but cost us $99 per night.

The keys did not work once we finally were checked in.  The champagne was not on ice in a hot room, on a hot day.  With no knock, we were interrupted by a housekeeper who came in our room, similed and attempted to make conversation as we both sat there, awe-struck!  After a disappointing dinner at the Meadows, we arrived to the rose petals on our bed.  They quickly turned brown and smelled like mold (with a dirty plate they left behind).  

As far as the room, we had requested a pool view on a very slow Monday night, only to get a room above the parking lot.  The light in the bathroom mirror did not work, the shower faucet fixture was falling off, and the sheets were stained on a bed that was hard and uncomfortable.

On arrival, the room was hot (near 80 degrees) we turned the AC on and sat out on the balcony for about an hour. The room cooled to 75 degrees.  We went to dinner and returned to find the room still at 75 degrees.  The front desk then informed us that they were having some difficulty with the air conditioner.  They recommended that we open our slider and let the cool evening breeze enter our room.  

The hotel is centrally located in Solvang.  We thought we would stay in Solvang because most wineries close around 5pm and besides dinner, there is not much to do at night in the wine country inn’s.  However, to our chagrin, Solvang shuts down at 6pm.  

The bed in our room was horribly hard.  My wife and I awoke in the morning like we’ve been beaten up over night.  I recommend asking for a pillow top mattress when booking this hotel.  Also, the pool is small and it filled quickly in the afternoon.  Overall, this is a quaint hotel in a quaint town.

Location of the hotel is great. Parking is free and plentiful. The room was quiet with no disturbances. 

We ate in the hotel one night and actually had a good meal of fish. Dinner for two of us (without wine) ran about $50. 2nd night we ate at the Vineyard in Santa Ynez.....now that was a great experience. You should eat there!

M-man11,180,,2005-12-31,NONE,2005-12-05,4,Much has improved here,"I notice that many of the reviewers have become increasingly more positive about this hotel.  Having stayed here last year (December) and this year, I am happy to report that there is much to like about the hotel.  The issue of cleanliness is extremely important to be.  Everywhere were maids and workers cleaning and polishing common areas.  Our own room got such a thorough cleaning that we had to wait over 30 minutes for our room to be ready on the second day.  (Perhaps the manager read the review from a guest who stayed here in April.)

Rooms are quite comfortable.  Even the standard doubles are reasonably large and there is enough space for two large suitcases. Lighting is good although we had to share the one light between our beds. Two large chairs are placed around the table for drinks or snacks.

The gingerbread house, created just for the holidays, is a crowd-pleaser, with many non-guests lining up to have their pictures taken.  There is therefore an air of festivity here.  With the annual Christmas parade ending just next door at the post office, the Royal Scandanavian is perfectly situated.  One can even walk to the nearby Mission Santa Inez (about 2 or 3 blocks).

The breakfasts are fine (try to get coupons for included breakfasts) and the service is helpful, albeit slow.  Much choice at dinner and the staff doesn't seem to care if one orders one or two appetizers instead of costlier main courses.  A verny nice wine list highlights local vintages.  One night, the winemaker for Ethan vineyards (Ethan himself) was working the bar at the hotel restaurant.  Great experience.

But there are still a few problems to resolve.  There are no guardrails in  the bathtub, a serious problem for anyone requiring attention.  Some of the screens need to be fixed so that bugs don't fly in the room during the warm weather.  If the hotel is full, the desk is often unable to accommodate the many guests checking out (everyone seems to want to check out at the same time!). Yes, noise can be a problems if guests decide to stand outside on the balcony for a moonlight chat or chant.  (A quick SHH! will work quite well.)

So do give the hotel a try.  There are many specials and rates available so that staying here can be quite affordable.

The only small complaint I had was that the hallway noise can quickly travel into the bedrooms which is what I found, but it wasn't too bad.  After a long day of wine tasting we went to bed around 8:30pm so if people rolled in around 10:00pm they weren't purposely trying to be loud but it did wake me up. Once they got out of the hallways and into their rooms it was quiet again.  The Meadows restaurant next door to the hotel is wonderful as well.

If you are, like me, a regular traveler just trying to get an honest opinion so that you don’t ruin your precious vacation time then read on…and for the record my, wife and I are not picky chronic complainers. Having stayed in all classes of hotels all over the world the most minimum expectation we have is one: cleanliness.  There is a difference between being worn and dirty. Since Trip advisor is wise enough to allow user photos we don’t need to go into too much detail. This hotel is a disgrace and should be avoided. Not only did our room #131 have bugs everywhere, it smelled so awful you could barely breathe. If you ever had a relative live in a room of your house that smoked cigars, kept a dog, was sick, or perhaps died then you’ll feel quite at home staying at the Royal Scandinavian Inn in Solvang, CA.  Sure everyone was friendly and pleasant when they told us that no other rooms were available that Saturday evening. In fact the entire area was booked. How convenient for the hotel – book sub-standard accommodations at $139 night knowing that your guests will have nowhere else to go. Someone at AAA must be getting a kickback for rating this hotel 3 stars. If you do any research you will find that it used to be the Sheraton Royal Scandinavian Inn but Sheraton was wise in terminating its affiliation.  There are very few true two or three star hotels in Solvang so be very careful. I did stay at the Holiday Inn Express in Solvang years ago without incident. Anyway, we checked out after one night and checked into the Marriott in Buellton 3 miles away.  Though we really wanted to be able to wake up and WALK to a shop to get a Danish and coffee we decided to sacrifice the convenience for cleanliness and comfort –which this particular Marriott excelled at. (Standard Room # 352 - $121 -including tax and AAA).  Finally, if Damon, the Royal Scandinavian hotel manager is reading this while posting his own “rave reviews,” I intend to follow through on my promise to dispute the room charge with my Amex,  write AAA to have the hotel’s status reviewed, and post this opinion on every travel site available.

There was no misunderstanding - nothing was said about changing the room.  They refused to do anything for me.  All rooms were full, they said.  At first, the manager refused to come out and talk to me.  I refused to leave and refused the standard room.  She finally came out of her hole to talk to me.  While I was waiting, I was also surprised at the lack of service to other customers.  People came to the front desk asking for help arrange a limo and were simply referred to the yellow pages.  Since this is wine country, I couldn't believe that they didn't already have some limo contacts.  I finally told them (knowing that the town would be booked) that I would take the room for $75, about half of what the rate they were trying to charge me.  The manager had left again, and the front desk girl said no.  I had to tell her once again to get the manager.  After huffing and puffing for 5 or 10 minutes, she finally relented.  

The place is adequate at best.  For the prices, you should have low expectations.

Coastal19847,1,,,,2004-09-21,5,Very enjoyable family stay,"My wife, 16 yr old, 9 yr old and myself stayed here for 4 days in June 2004. We had a very enjoyable stay and would not heisitate to return. Everyone was very helpful and the room was comfortable. We had a 1st floor pool side room and liked the ability to sit out on the little patio outside our room and watch the kids swim in the pool.
We liked that the views from our patio were of grass, trees and rolling hills instead of commercial properties and parking lots.
It sits right on the edge of the main shopping and dining area and just about anywhere in town can be reached with a 5 to 15 min. walk.

candaklo,13,"Charleston, South Carolina",,,2004-08-03,3,Royal Scandinavian Inn,"My sister, our cousin, and I stayed three nights at the Royal Scandinavian Inn.  We were very comfortable.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  We arrived late, so we were put in a room with a view of the parking lot.  They graciously allowed us to change to a room with a view of the mountains and the pool area the next day.  We wished we'd had a microwave and a fridge, but other than that all was fine.  The lobby area is beautiful.  We ate dinner one evening at the restaurant ""The Meadows.""  Most of the tables were in the sun, which was very uncomfortable.  There was no way to escape.  We suggested to the manager that they have blinds installed.  Food was very averge for the prices.  The motel was convenient to shopping, but not on the main street.

SpudChucker,31,,,,2004-07-07,5,Best In Solvang,"Our family has stayed in Solvang during trips to and from Southern California for over fifteen years yet we just recently stayed at the Royal Scandanavian for the first time. Now, we can't figure out why we neglected to stay here in the first place and we won't stay anywhere else again. The rooms are clean and some have excellent views of the hills South of town. The pool area is nice and the hotel is close to everything while still being off the main streets. The staff is professional and courteous. The upper floors have nice decks to sit out on and enjoy the scenery after a day of visiting wineries, shopping, or having dinner at The Hitching Post in nearby Buellton.

DaveAndBetty,69,,2004-03-31,NONE,2004-03-31,5,First-Class Experience,"We stayed here two nights in the last week of March 2004. The spacious lobby with a burning fireplace sets the pace for a first-class experience. Our third-floor room with a balcony overlooking the Solvang countryside provided a tranquil and refreshing view. The quiet location, away from Solvang's Mission Street, was easily accessible. 
The room's decor was attractive. Front-desk employees were helpful and professional. Room servcie was prompt and the meal was tasty. We have stayed here before and will return again.

Swimkat,4,,2004-01-31,NONE,2004-01-19,4,Wonderful little inn,"What a find! This inn is located off the main drag (Mission Street) in Solvang, somewhat aways from all the tourist shops. It has plenty of free parking, a very friendly staff, and extremely clean rooms. We were on the third floor, overlooking the pool and farmlands and found the average-sized room to be very adequate. It also sits just behind the Mission Santa Ines and a few blocks away from the Cafe Angelica (which compares extremely well with some of the best restaurants in the San Francisco Bay Area).We had a non-smoking room but could smell some of the smoke, we think from air duct circulation? Also, the hotel had a slight air-freshener odor, which was not problematic though noticeable throughout the enitre hotel.",,5.0,4.0,,,4.0,4.0,,,,,9
Seville68,16,"Perrysburg, Ohio",,,2004-01-08,5,Great Hotel,Stayed here just before Christmas 2003. We had a room on the second floor overlooking the pool. The room was extremely spacious and well-kept. The furniture standard was excellent. On check-in the staff couldn't be more helpful and again on check-out. The pool was a good size and very pleasantly placed. There isn't anything bad that I can say about this hotel. I would most definitely return to it.,,,,,,,,,,,,36
Getaway5169,1,,,,2003-07-03,4,"Friendly, helpful service","Our stay at the Royal Scandinavian Inn made our weekend trip to Solvang comfortable and relaxing. Rooms are an adequate size, furnished with tole-painted pseudo-antique furniture. The best point was the balcony that let in cool evening breezes and gave a beautiful view of the surrounding hills. Ask for a third floor room with south balcony. There is a restaurant that serves good food, including the nightly smorgasbord that focuses on a few well-prepared offerings rather than a weighted table of less-than-desirable dishes. The best thing about the Inn, however, is its friendly service. Every employee we approached during our three days went out of his/her way to be helpful. (If you're a cyclist, there's a great short ride (easy) from Solvang to Los Olivos (about 6 miles)where you can lunch at sidewalk cafe, taste the local wines and return downhill to Solvang. You don't have to be a killer cyclist to make this trip.)",,,,,,,,,,,,7
