Alex Sico,162,"Calgary, Canada",2021-11-30,NONE,2021-11-28,4,Satisfied overall,"The hotel was in a good location, relatively rapid access to everything we wanted to visit throughout our 4 day stay. The room was clean, and had everything we needed including a mini-fridge (not stocked), microwave, and safe. The stay was reasonably priced, adequate for the service provided. Slept well each night, the bed and pillows were comfortable. My only complaint was the price of the parking. It is gated and safe, but it turned out to be around 120 CAD for our 3 night stay. Various vending machines were available on each floor, which is a nice touch for people who like a quick snack like me. I never got a chance to see the pool or try the breakfast (which I believe was included with the stay) so I cannot comment on that.
Overall I was satisfied and I would return. I recommend this to anyone looking for a good location in LA, and a good night of sleep.","I recommend staying in room on higher up floors, quieter.",4.0,4.0,,5.0,,,,,,,173

He went beyond what we expected and did it with a positive attitude. He helped us in to our spacious room. The beds are a bit hard but after a few days it worked out. The pool was open but a bit chilly. A bit of a warning, covid cards are asked for all over Los Angeles FYI. The hotel was very close to a lot of restaurants so we didn’t need a car.

Cindy W,662,"New York City, New York",2021-10-31,COUPLES,2021-11-02,3,Keep your visit to 1 night only,"There is a reason why this hotel is reasonably priced…but I am not sure why it is ranked so high.

We were here for 2 nights to celebrate our anniversary and Halloween. But the hotel didn’t acknowledge our anniversary note during check-in. The process also took a while and the front desk made a copy of our IDs. Why was that necessary given that the room was prepaid??

Also, the staff wasn’t wearing masks while LA has the indoor mask policy.

I had to sanitize my ID before putting it back into my wallet.

Our room was small….but it was charming with a balcony overlooking the courtyard. The bathroom was dated and the tiles looked really sad. The room was lacking charging outlets and there wasn’t any working space as the TV took about half of the desk. 

The floor underneath the shelves were dirty and dusty. There were also dents and chips on the wall and the bathroom door. The floor overall was dirty too since my barefoot got dirty after walking on it.

The hotel is huge…with an outdoor pool and a very small gym. There is a sauna that I didn’t get to visit, but you need to reserve it with the front desk during COVID. The ATM didn’t work and the elevator takes a while to arrive.

Here is a tip, skip the expensive parking fee. Meters are free after 8pm on Saturday until 8am Monday morning.",Park at the meter on the weekend for free,,,,,,,,,,,276

Have to say I was more than pleasantly surprised! From the gated private parking to the spotless and comfortable guest room I was assigned, the offer exceeded my expectations. Staff were attentive and helpful, the halls and room were quiet, both bed and bath were clean (and there was daily maid service -- unusual in this times.) I was out and about a lot via rental car so didn't avail myself on many on-site services or facilities but was I used I was satisfied with. There's also a Metro station just one block away, I noted.",I had an interior courtyard view room (315) -- Very quiet!,,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,,,,,9
Andrew P,1,,2021-09-30,NONE,2021-09-21,1,TOTAL MISREPRESENTATION.,"This is my first review, and I'm happily going out of my way to write it. 

The Hollywood Hotel is absolutely nothing like what the photos show. My girlfriend and I were coming up to Hollywood for a wedding and were in a rush to get to our room and get dressed before leaving in our Uber. We had probably a total of 20-30 minutes in the room and immediately noticed how awful the quality was. Rust in the showers, stucco ceilings, paint chips all over, cramped room, and shared balconies. This is not a 4 Star Hotel.

Unfortunately we couldn't check out right away because we obviously had a wedding to run to.

Once we got back after the wedding we saw again how unsafe everything was, especially at night. The area is NOT a nice part of town and the whole lobby absolutely reeked of weed. We went straight to our room, packed, and checked out at 10PM that night to then drive an hour back to OC instead of staying in this awful spot.

I tried calling to request a refund because we didn't do it in the moment (we were exhausted and ready to go to sleep), and the front desk manager just kept saying ""the room was utilized, we will not be refunding you."" So basically we paid $200 for parking and 30 minutes to get ready. 

I let her know we didn't even sleep there and had no time to check out prior to coming back since... we were at a wedding... and obviously she had no sympathy for that either. I told her there is no way I am the only one to have had these same complaints considering their pictures online are a COMPLETE MISREPRESENTATION of what they actually offer, and she said ""you are the first sir.""

Don't waste your money or risk your safety, they won't do anything to help...",,1.0,1.0,,1.0,,,Gisel Miller,General Manager,2021-09-21,"Dear Guest

Dena checked me in and helped me with recommendations around the area, she was absolutely great. So was Nancy. They both cared a lot and were helpful.

The room was clean, classy, and had a Hollywood feel. If I were nitpicking I would say the room could do with more substantial pillows, they were a little too unstuffed. That's obviously not a reason not to go to the hotel, but in case the hotel reads this maybe they can buy firmer or more full pillows.",,,,,,,,,,,,8

At first I didn't think that the shower worked either. It was just very hard to pull on the water. The drain in the shower was also not screwed in so I warned my kids to be careful not to step on it as it could move and cut their foot. Besides those things everything else was great!

Beyond that, the manager and staff were incredible! They were very friendly and helpful! The manager and one particular staff spent significant amounts of time with us mapping out the easiest way to get where we were going. Also, they took the time to tell us about fun attractions and helped us secure tickets .

Cody,6,"Orlando, Florida",2021-08-31,FRIENDS,2021-08-23,4,First trip to Cali,"Admittedly, my friends and I were a little skeptical of this hotel at first. Living clear across the country, I relied on pictures and the reviews to base my opinion before arriving. It was the cheapest I could find for 5 days. However, my friends and I were pleasantly surprised. The area surrounding the hotel is less than desirable but I felt very safe staying here. When you drive around back, there is gate access for guests to park their cars. Its very secure. I never saw anyone come through the gate who wasn't supposed to. The outside of the hotel could use some TLC but our room inside was better. My friends and I are in wheelchairs so we had the accessible double queen beds. The tile flooring worked well for our wheelchairs. The bathroom was spacious enough for 2 wheelchairs to navigate if needed. There was a built-in shower chair with a hand-held shower head. Shower worked great. My only complaint about the room was the beds were too high for us to transfer easily. Also, the mirrors in the bathroom were too high. In a handicapped accessible room, you should be able to see your self in the mirror while you are getting ready. Not just the top of your head. Unfortunately, weed is legal in Cali so you def. Have to get used to smelling it everywhere...especially when you walk into the hotel. Not much they can do about that unfortunately.Lastly, shout out to Brian at the front desk...I hope he doesn't get in trouble for this but he didn't charge me for having a 3rd person in my room. I work in customer service and the first rule is to make the customer happy...Thank You, Brian. He was so kind and helpful. He was knowledgeable about places to go and see. I def. Had an amazing first time in Cali and I cannot wait to come back. I would recommend this place if you are looking for an affordable place to stay.",,,,,,,,,,,,2

Steve A,1,,2021-07-31,FRIENDS,2021-08-07,4,"Awesome Staff, Close to Attractions, Very Affordable","Visited Cali with a group of friends for 5 days. We had a lot we wanted to do, but no idea where to start. Dina (front desk) helped lay out our trip with directions and suggestions for best times to go. She was a rockstar and knew all the best places to eat/drink around where we were going. We had a blast! Pool was great too for when we had down time and their courtyard is very relaxing.

We walked wherever possible, but the location is also close to public transit. 1 bus to observatory or 1 bus to Santa Monica, etc. 

If you have a rental, you’ll be 10 mins or less from the Staple Center, Observatory, walk of fame, Chinese Theater, and much more!

Heads up though, they aren’t doing the sauna or free breakfast because of Covid, but there are many restaurants in the area including one in the hotel. They also don’t allow smoking anywhere on the premises, so had to walk out to the sidewalk.

Ashley T,11,"Clear Lake, Iowa",2021-07-31,SOLO,2021-07-17,1,Ants In Our Pants,"Let me first start by saying the only reason I’m rating this a “one” is because Gisel was amazing at check! She was training someone and answering phones! She was professional on every level! 
However, Our room was/is aweful! No control of AC, No where for Our Dog to go Potty, 1 spot to plug things in, Ants in bathroom, Half the lights on Bathroom  mirror didn’t work! Dou to not being able to control the AC we wanted to open the window. Our Dog was panting so hard, from it being so hot in our room, But there were no screens in the windows! The pictures on the website, are VERY deceiving. All though, the pool does mostly look like the photos! The Gift shop is VERY hot, and looks nothing like an actual Gift Shop! On the other hand, The Man working in there is so sweet and helpful! 
There is also water spots in the ceiling by our vent! Holes in the wall, &shower looks as if it’s about to come out of the wall! We paid over $700. For ONLY TWO Nights! Absolutely Ridiculous! 

We brought our Foster Daughter on her FIRST Vacation Ever! In her Whole life! We traveled Six Days to get here!!! We decided hey we’re in Hollywood, why not spend a little extra for her! 
I could have gotten better a Wyndham Hotel!!!

Melanie F,1,,2021-07-31,COUPLES,2021-07-10,1,Worst hotel ever,Do not say this location their AC does not work they have ants in the bathroom and in the bedroom the hair dryer is poor quality and almost caught my hand on fire and the front desk agents are very unpersonable and unfriendly if you stay in Hollywood or Los Angeles area do not pick this location is the worst place I've ever stayed even at a two-star I feel it would be a better accommodation for the rain you expect more for the area you'd expect more but you get less. You do not ever stay at this property,,,,,,,,Gisel Miller,General Manager,2021-07-12,"Dear Guest

Thinking this must be a mistake; I called the hotel back to learn that while we were flying, they cancelled our reservation and gave our room to someone else.

Tamara G,1,"Albuquerque, New Mexico",2021-05-31,NONE,2021-06-29,1,Broken Down Hotel,"Manager Cecile Eugenio  was the best thing as well as an agent by the name of Diana .  ​Cecile listened and seemed genuinely  concerned for our family and making our stay nice.  It was not a great stay though as the first night the hot water in the bathtub did not work and that was a huge reason for us staying here.  Next day maintenance couldn't fix the issue so we had to move,  in the next room the Refrigerator was not working or on, maintenance was able to get that working but it was later in the morning and all our refrigerated items became too warm and we had to throw perishable items away.  The 3rd day my husband was alone at the motel and he could not find his way to the room and the attendant that evening treated him like he was homeless and then called me to ask what room my husband belong in.  It was very frightening as my husband was not feeling well on this trip due to a recent fall in our bathroom at home.

The Manager Cecile Eugenio was the best thing there but as far as the hotel it is a shambles and I will never stay there again.",,,3.0,5.0,5.0,,,Gisel Miller,General Manager,2021-07-06,"Dear Guest,

We decided to stay at the Hollywood Hotel because of location and price.  When we arrived we noticed the hotel is very clean and all staff were very helpful and friendly.  Due to covid they did not serve breakfast, which was a bummer, but we hit a nearby grocery store for a few items we could microwave in our room.  There is a sundry shop if you forget anything and also have drinks/snacks, the courtyard is very nice and it looks like they used to service drinks/food before covid.  Hopefully it will return because it is a nice space.  I used it to sit and read .  Pool is nice and relaxing but it was cold....at least to me it was.  I've never been to LA before but be aware there is homeless up the street.  They seemed to be everywhere except for Beverly Hills though.  We didn't run into any issues but was warned by a few LAPD officers to be careful.  Overall, I think this is a great place to stay and I would recommend to friends/family.",,,5.0,,4.0,5.0,,,,,,26

While understanding that Covid had shut down some things…the best part of the hotel was under renovations which was their lounge and bar. We were super disappointed that there was no restaurant and no bar. Our room also had problems with the refrigerator not working. We spoke with the night managers Phil and Gustavo Who were beyond sympathetic to our need for a better room. Without asking to be upgraded, they offered to upgrade us to a much better room. It made all the difference. Our trip turned around and we had the best weekend we could’ve imagined. They were the sweetest and most understanding hotel staff that I’ve ever encountered and I’ve traveled quite a bit. ",,,,,,,,Gisel Miller,General Manager,2021-06-10,"Dear Guest

The international television channels- who knew French TV was good? and B. The beautiful courtyard ajoining our room.  An additional point given for the hotel being dog friendly.  Location is perfect for locals such as ourselves. It is a mixed, diverse neighborhood, so if you are looking for a 1960's TV set California, this isn't it. But the location ( just off the 101), proximity to attractions and cheap eats can't be beat. No, it is not on the beach. But the beach is just a short  Uber drive away, and this place is easily $100 cheaper per night.

James P,1,,2021-04-30,NONE,2021-04-12,3,Not Impressed,"We stayed two nights.Next time it will be a different hotel in a better part of the city. It is an older hotel in a not so great neighborhood. The parking lot is gated to keep out the homeless who live in encampments on the sidewalks outside the hotel. We were disappointed to be notified when we checked in that parking is an additional charge, $30 a day! and that their is no free breakfast because of Covid-19. At other hotels we stayed at a minimum,  provided  a bagged breakfast of muffin, juice and a granola bar. They should update their website to inform potential patrons of their current conditions.
The fountain which is in the back is not operational.
Even though we had a do not disturb sign on the door. Housekeeping entered our room and it frightened our daughter who was in there by herself doing school work. 
I emptied our coolers into the refrigerator only to discover the following day that it did not work and we lost all of perishable food! The rooms are not carpeted and make for a loud room.

Rooms are smallish but well-equipped, with a few glitches like a broken hair dryer and missing bathroom hooks. My main complaint was that we were not informed that the ""complimentary hot American breakfast buffet, featuring everything from cereal to omelets to coffee"" heralded on the website and reaffirmed in my reservation confirmation was unavailable due to COVID until after we had checked in.

Mara P,1,,2021-03-31,SOLO,2021-03-31,1,Wish I had done more research,"I am lying on a rock hard bed in the Hollywood Hotel right now. No sleep due to noise and concrete mattress and pot smoke filling up my room. People are allowed to smoke pot in front of the building, right outside the front door in the carriage drive. They are not on the public sidewalk but fully on the property of the hotel, and so the hotel could legally forbid this. I did complain but was told by front desk staff that I would just have to live with it. This place is like a homeless hotel. Drunk men singing ballads in the street at 3 AM, men yelling “Ma! Open up” and pounding on doors at all hours. Babies crying and dogs barking. The lights don’t work right in my room. Neither does the refrigerator or the thermostat. The water never gets hot enough to take a comfortable shower. If I were homeless I would be grateful for this roof over my head but would still long for real lodgings away from the squalor. As it is, I paid full price for this flop and so I’m feeling ripped off. The photos this place posts are deceiving. Google the address and use street view to see what the hotel really looks like. You are more likely to see a neighborhood thug with a machete than you are to spot an expensive sports car out front of this place. And the photos of the outside are actually photos of the back. The fountain doesn’t work, and the whole thing is surrounded by a car park and very run down in daylight. My room has a view of a laundromat (open 24 hours!). Sad. The front desk staff were pretty nice when I checked in, and my room was not very dirty. So those are two good things, which bring the Hollywood Hotel just to the level of decent housing for the homeless. Don’t say you were not warned.",,,,,,,,,,,,1

I knew that I have a 3 month assignment in one of the hospitals nearby. I thought I could bear a 2 hour commute 3 days in a week, but I was so tired that I want to just sleep. Not a lot of  better or safe looking hotels around the area; lo and behold I found a hidden hotel called Hollywood Hotel. The facade is hidden by tall greeneries and the parking lot is gated ( I feel secured knowing it’s LA) Checking in was a breeze. Shoutout to Pil. He has an excellent customer service skills and attitude. He was very helpful and I am grateful. I got the double queen and I have the city view. The room is so clean without any offending smell. The room has microwave, fridge and coffee maker. I practically could stay here longer like in a college dorm. I now know where to stay. I will always come back to LA and this will be my go to hotel.

carisa9,2,"Thousand Oaks, California",2020-09-30,FAMILY,2020-09-04,1,DO NOT STAY HERE,"The hotel wreaks of cigarettes and there are cigarette butts in the stairwell. The concierge is beyond disrespectful and un accommodating. We chose this hotel due to the proximity to Children’s Hospital. Upon check in we learned that they had canceled our reservation due to not having a card on file, even though we gave it over the phone. We never received an email or phone call that they were canceling. Due to this, they charged us more than our initial booking fee and couldn’t accommodate all of the days we originally booked. My husband had dropped myself and my son at the hospital for surgery, by the time he picked me up (approximately 2 hours later) we had decided we needed a new hotel because this one was not up to standards or what the website depicted. They refused to honor the original booking date or give us a full refund. My 8 year old is in surgery as I type this and this is the last thing we should be stressing over. Gisel the front desk manager should take a lesson in hospitality and compassion. Luckily we’ve already spoken to our bank and CC company to dispute the charge. Do yourself a favor and DO NOT STAY here. The area is also sketchy, we were hoping to be able to walk to the hospital but I would not feel safe doing so.",,,,,,,,Gisel Miller,General Manager,2020-12-21,"Dear Guest,

Tracy L,32,"Seattle, Washington",2020-08-31,SOLO,2020-08-10,4,Excellent for a Quick Stay,"I crashed here for a few days while my daughter recovered from surgery. Let me start off by saying HH is clean. Really clean. The floors in the rooms are mopped daily, and my room sparkled after every housekeeping stop. I felt safe: you must have a room key card or be buzzed in the main entrance, and the elevator has its own “secret handshake” to get to your floor. Every staff member was friendly and helpful. The rooms are a bit shabby: furniture dented, walls and doors with chipped paint, and my bathroom door did not close completely, but I’m coming back to clean because that’s the most important thing to me. Good place to stay for a couple of days, but I don’t know that I would base myself there as a tourist. The neighborhood is a tad iffy, a hospital district, so you don’t want to go out alone after dark. Close to a metro stop, and about 1/2 mile away (walkable in the day) is super cute Los Feliz. During the day I felt perfectly fine. I do not regret staying.

Our room was stylish, clean, and had a nice little balcony. While I didn’t expect to get much sun at the time, I ended up getting way more than a bargained for at the pool. The hotel was very close to some great food options in Koreatown and was just a short ride away from major tourist spots in Hollywood.

TravelsRwe,24,,2020-03-31,NONE,2020-04-15,3,Hollywood UnGlamour,"So I will make this as fair as I can be unlike some of the other latest dubious reviews - Driving up to the hotel you won’t see the waterfall as shown on the pictures as this is in fact at the back of the property; it’s fairly non-descript from the front with a drive up to the front lobby. Checking in was fine and the two gentlemen on the front desk were friendly, you do have to leave a small refundable deposit ($100 at the time of writing) for your stay, however I did feel uncomfortable with the hotel taking my passport and making a photocopy of it - I don’t know of any hotel outside of Eastern Europe who does this practice and see no reason for doing this with guests, that aside, check-in was completed and was I was shown where the lift was. My room (classed as Starlet Queen); was an odd combination of modern and updated, with a slightly run down bathroom. Good Wi-Fi, excellent choice of TV channels (yes I like TV!), microwave and fridge (didn’t use) and coffee maker. I have to say the coffee was lovely for being a known brand name (Starbucks) as usually it’s a bland blend supplied. The bathroom had a small makeover in relation to the mirror and taps, but the walls were not repainted nor tiled to an updated standard. The cleaning of the bathroom also left a lot to be desired. I don’t really mind if the odd hair is visible as this can’t be helped, however the floor really did look like someone had had body alopecia, never once was it mopped during my stay and it showed.  However my room generally was cleaned to a good standard throughout with towels refreshed and coffee topped up etc. Plug sockets however left a lot to be desired - one was hanging off the wall and certainly couldn’t be used safely, another was behind a heavy unit (where the safe and microwave are) with it also slightly hanging off the wall, the only socket safe enough was below the TV so charging items was a bit of a challenge at times.  The bed was very comfortable but the pillows less so as very flimsy and flat.  The worse part of my stay though is the noise from the constant door slamming - literally you’ve never heard anything like it and needs addressing - slam, Slam, SLAM! People staying really had no consideration for others and this continued late into the night and early in the morning.  The closers on the door are ineffectual, a sign asking  people to close doors quietly would be a great help as the first two nights I barely slept. On day three, and returning  after a day out, I went to reception and asked if I could transfer rooms, I was met with the most hostile receptionist (if you know the musical Oliver, then you’ll know the name of Bill Sikes’s girlfriend - should you never have the misfortune to be served by her)  - She couldn’t have cleared less, patronising in tone and manner, bluntly and loudly informing me in front of her male colleagues that I should have come to her in the morning (?!) and that nothing can be done, when I stated that they had other rooms on the website she just repeated herself louder and though it was funny. The final insult being that she offered me ear plugs - WOW! I just walked away as people like that are not worth dealing with. Breakfast was included (didn’t eat their) plus a bar area open for cocktails and drinks in the evening.  Checking out was fine and the two ladies very kindly stored my luggage for the day and were so pleasant and helpful. The area itself feels a little unsafe at night but it’s just that, a feeling and it’s fine. Some local food eateries are close by but there really isn’t much in the immediate area. The subway however is just a five minute walk (station Vermont/Santa Monica on the Red Line, usually every 12 mins or so); some people have pointed out the homeless and vagrants hanging outside the station but again, it’s like any big city and they do not bother you. So, with all of that said would I stay again? Here’s the thing, if you could fix the slamming of doors then actually I would stay again! My room was fine on the whole, and as I don’t drive pubic transport was close by and quick to travel, and by the time I left, I had actually enjoyed my stay - so make of it what you will!",,,3.0,2.0,,3.0,,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-04-29,"Dear Guest,

"Ms, Stickney",1,,2020-03-31,BUSINESS,2020-04-08,5,Pil the Customer Service Miracle Worker,"We were in a pickle for real. Stranded in LA since the COVID-19 hit and after 3 weeks of feeling like a nomad I was at wits end. Our apartment renovation and been halted and we had held up in Jesse's studio to respect the Stay at Home Rule.  
We learned that the hotel we'd called home for 2 weeks was closing so that the staff could remain on lockdown with their families. 
Now we were faced with finding  comfortable clean safe and affordable accommodations at the last minute and in the middle of a mandatory STAY@ HOME Rule.
We heard NO VACANCY four times before Jesse called the property and handed me the phone.
On the other end of the phone was a warm and upbeat young man. Professional positive and personable.  He told us his name was Pil.
I was fighting panic and was ready to get inside SAFE, Pil put me at ease right away and I was able to be candid about our dilemma.
Pile reassured us that he would find a way to assist us and that he did. He found a rate that worked for us
We drove right over to the property and met Pil, on point and SAFE which meant so much to us.  As he checked us in Oil wore his mask his gloves he took to maintain social distancing. He used a disinfectant wipe for the credit card the terminal and all effortlessly.
Pil offered us Customer Service at it's best. Above and beyond the call of duty.","I love the courtyard. The property  is wonderful, quiet and understated elegance. Reminds me of the Golden Age of Hollywood.",5.0,5.0,5.0,,,,,,,,2

I was very happy with the hotel staff for doing such a good job during that time. Some remodeling was occurring during our stay but it was not disruptive at all, mostly during the day. If you want to use public transportation, get a bus ticket for the FlyAway, it’s $8 and will take you to Hollywood and Vine and a short walk around the corner to the Metro and to the Hotel. Staff is very friendly and our room was spotless with twin queen beds that were very comfortable. There is laundry, a bar (Opens in the evening, a nice secluded pool with seating and lounge chairs, small dinning area that serves complimentary breakfast where Hugo can make you a fantastic omelette to start your day. The neighborhood is a little scary if you aren’t used to City life but you leave all that behind when you walk through the doors. LA was amazing even through our ordeal and the staff having to slowly disinfect everything. The furniture was all gone, dinning room cleared and they were still very friendly and helpful while doing all that. There is no HBO or other movie channel but I really didn’t care much. Professional and courteous prompt service. Great stay.

Within walking distance to the underground. We never felt unsafe at all as a few of the reviews have suggested.

Explorer780386,6,,2020-03-31,NONE,2020-03-18,2,The midnight check-in and disappointing experience,"We arrived at ‘The Hollywood Hotel’ just after midnight. I waited at the front desk for a time and when the hotel receptionist finally came around the corner he was dismissive and impatient. Our reservation was made through Expedia.com, so he was unaware of our request for a larger room and roll away cot. This seemed to annoy him. We headed upstairs to find that the card keys to our room did not work. We waited in the hall instead of going back to the front desk, because he said he would bring the roll-away bed. When asking for new card keys he gave me a look of disdain and then proceeded to try all four of the card keys, which as previously stated did not open the door. He used his manager key to let us in our room and told us we had to push the bed into the room and set it up ourselves. He turned in his heel and left presumably to make us new keys. After waiting 20 minutes, I went downstairs to pick up the keys. Already travel weary, I did not appreciate the attitude and inhospitable treatment. Especially upon finding out the next day that due to the coronavirus, the hotel was only at 18% capacity. 

The room itself was relatively clean, just worn as the photos show. Our showers were lukewarm and so was the room. Sadly, the airflow could not be adjusted. There was an AC panel on the wall, but no power to the unit. 

The outdoor spaces and pool looked beautiful in the photos, however due to rain they were closed to hotel patrons for the four days we were booked. The explanation was that someone could slip and fall. Isn’t that implied? it’s a swimming pool, water 💦 

After two days of rain, we left LA and went to San Diego. The Hollywood Hotel had us prepay for the roll-away cot and parking for our four day stay. When we tried to check out after two days, they said our 4 day reservation was non-refundable and refused to give us our money back for the 2 days we would not be using the roll-away cot or parking. 

The only bright star in this whole escapade and waste of hard-earned money was the breakfast. The Chef was wonderful! His omelets and maple waffles were delicious. He was personable, and the entire breakfast staff was very sweet.","rooms need updating, microwave was older than my teenage daughter",2.0,1.0,2.0,,,,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-23,"Dear guest...

Camilla,7,,2020-03-31,COUPLES,2020-03-15,2,Not like the pictures at all,"When looking at the pictures on Expedia or the hotel’s own website, the hotel looks really nice and almost luxurious but do NOT expect this. First of all, the room was old and in bad shape (See the pictures). Then the cold water wasn’t working so the water was boiling hot and it started to leak under the sink. We told the receptionist this and he said someone would come within an hour and take care of it. When we came back to the hotel several hours later in the evening, nobody had been there. Then we talked to the receptionist the next day and finally it was fixed. 
Also, the old hairdryer wasn’t working and sometimes the light wasn’t working. All in all, everything was just old, worn, and could use a renovation. 
Next time I would also pick another location as there were a lot of homeless people and people who made the area uncomfortable. ",,,,,,,,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-23,"Dear Guest...

YuyaK,4,,2020-02-29,COUPLES,2020-02-23,5,14 days of fun,"Stayed at the Hollywood hotel with my girlfriend for 14 days and sadly my vacation came to and end. But I have to give a lot of thanks to the Hollywood hotel for making us feel at home. 

The staff is the most friendly helpful and professional staff ever. They know all the trendy places in Los Angeles they make you feel like a VIP all the time. It was a pleasant feeling knowing we were safe at the hotel. One of our favorite staff Members was Pil it really felt like he was always at the hotel. He never missed giving us a smile of a hello no matter what was going on at the hotel. 

The breakfast here is amazing, but there are also plenty of local hot spots around the hotel if you want to have a variety. Ask the front desk they know all the places. 

The pool was definitely one of the highlights. A bit chilly but a great place to hangout and take in some LA SUN ( when it wasn’t cloudy) 

At first sight we thought we made an error choosing this hotel because of the outside and the homeless. But soon after check in, the staff makes you feel right at home.",,,,,,,,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-27,"Dear Guest,

Kathy W,48,"Essex, Vermont",2020-02-29,COUPLES,2020-02-02,3,Pay a Little More and stay elsewhere.,"We arrived Sunday 1/26/20. Poor check in experience. Our flight & Lyft has us at the hotel by 1:50. We were told to sit and wait until at least 2:30. We checked a couple of times after and still had to wait as the “Jr. suite” room we had booked wasn’t ready yet.. After 3pm we checked and was told it would be another couple of hours, or they could put us into a newly renovated room “for no additional charge”  Around 3:45 we finally got into room 209. The room A/C didn’t work. When we called the front desk to complain they told us it was part of their  “green Initiative ” We had to sleep with the balcony door open to cool down the room to our comfort level. Then, at least twice during our stay we had to close it as somebody was smoking outside and the smell was coming into our room.... despite the fact that it was advertised as a non-smoking hotel.
The room fridge was barely below room
temps. We asked that it be adjusted since the knob to do so,  was removed. We had to throw away food leftovers as they weren’t kept cold enough to be safe to eat.
We were a little disappointed that we had to live out of our suitcases for the week as there were no drawers for our clothes only a small rolling rack with hangers. Our TV remote didn’t work and had to be replaced.  Also our Safe wasn’t working and had to be fixed. 
Chef Bruno was rather unpleasant to my husband when he asked to put some sliced deli ham into his omelette , which had been done the morning before by the woman working. 
The bathroom shower took a solid 2 minutes of running to get hot water. 
Midweek they were sanding/grinding down the elevator doors on the lobby level. By the time we checked out on Sunday, the residue was still not cleaned up off the floor/left corner of the door. 
The only saving grace was The 2 friendly gals at the front desk. 
We had to search for the pool. It’s not in the building, you had to walk across the parking lot.

Small gym but suitable for several guest. Pool is very well kept tho to cold to swim in during the winter. 

Rooms are quite spacious, specially for a solo traveler. Cleaning ladies are very nice and polite. Free Starbucks coffee which was a pleasant surprise.

Staff is friendly and helpful. Pil went above the call of duty for me, so big thanks Pil.

Jodie PM,175,"Wurtsboro, New York",2020-01-31,COUPLES,2020-01-22,3,Ehhh... I'm not a fan,"First let me tell you that I am not very picky about hotels when they have reasonable rates, and this hotel does have very reasonable rates.   However, our experience there was mediocre, at best.  When we checked in, I had to sign documents promising that we would follow the rules.  They took a $100 deposit even though it was a regular credit card.  We had to pay almost $30 a night to park the car.  Everything was very persnickety.  The hotel is not in a nice area.  The subway is a block away, but there are homeless people living in tents on the sidewalk going to the subway.  The subway itself scared me.  We are from NY and often ride the subway without issue, but it is very clear that no one is patrolling these stations.  After that ride, we drove or took an Uber everywhere. When we asked at the front desk if the neighborhood was safe, we got a response as if he was insulted.  We decided to venture out and that's when we ran into the tents, garbage strewn all over the sidewalk, and people being very aggressive outside the subway entrance. 

The room was big and had a lovely view of the courtyard, which was very pretty.  It is old though.   The floor is linoleum or something like that.   The TV was not quite in front of the bed, but off to the side.  Although housekeeping did make up the bed and empty the garbage, they did not clean out the ice bucket and put it back.  The shower was fantastic. The water pressure was great.

As far as the breakfast goes, the reviews on here make me laugh.  It looked incredible, but looks can be deceiving.  There is an omelette bar and a chef there.   He was not friendly at all.  The rest of the food was ridiculous.  The bacon was sliced so thin, you could see through it.  I don't know how they accomplished that.   They had tater tots for hashbrowns.  They had store bought bagels, the kind from a package and a basket of bread to make toast.  They had coldcuts (???) and cereal.  The orange juice tasted like water with an orange essence.  Plus, the chef would make waffles upon request.  I mean, it was free, and food is food, but the breakfast at the La Quinta or Comfort Inn.

All in all, it was okay, but if I return to the area, I will choose a place in a safer, walkable neighborhood that is newer.",,,,,,,,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-30,"Dear Guest,

fit4life120,10,"Lancaster, Wisconsin",2020-01-31,SOLO,2020-01-13,3,Book if you are an early riser and not by yourself,"Beautifully remodeled rooms, beautiful building, nice staff, good continental breakfast. Not a place to be walking out after dark, especially alone. I was alone on this trip and didn’t even feel comfortable driving near it. Drug users and homeless everywhere. I think you may be ok during the day but being single I did not try it. 
Also, if you’d like to sleep past 6:30 without doors slamming constantly, you should find a different hotel. The beautiful, heavy doors have nothing on them to keep from slamming loudly. They have a sign saying to respect the others but obviously that isn’t working. They need to actually put something on them. 
All in all, it was a great nights sleep until 6ish. 😁 the bed was very comfortable if you like a more firm mattress.

The hotel is kept in a clean ,tidy and comfortable condition all over and the decor is really good . Reception and shop are brilliant for tips and advice for getting around and restaurant choices .

This is what lets the hotel down.  We had no problems with noise in the street or the corridor as per some other reviewers.  The bed was fine and so were the sockets.  Our rooms (we had two) were actually pretty large. The swimming pool area is very nice and well-kept.  There is ongoing work to improve the decor.  

The staff at the front desk and Hugo at breakfast are full of tips and advice.  It's well worth picking their brains.  

The location is great!  There are bus and train stops within a 2 minute walk.  We got in to Hollywood itself and out to places like Santa Monica/Venice Beach quickly and at minimal cost.  It was also easy to get Ubers out to places like Long Beach as the traffic was good around the hotel.

When pulling up to the hotel from the main road I was concerned with the appearance and dated exterior. The nice fountain pictured is in the back gated parking area. I was greeted at the front desk by Pil. He was lovely, friendly and put me at ease with my choice of hotel. The room was basic and dated but cleanliness was no issue. I got a room facing the courtyard and it was very quiet the entire 2 nights of my stay. On to the reason you want to stay here. The free breakfast is fantastic and Hugo's reputation is well earned. Friendly and happy to serve up delicious omelets or waffles. In addition to the fresh made items there are pastries and breads and cereals and yogurts. Plenty for all.

Check in was at 3pm but I arrived 2 hours early. I was kindly greeted by Nicole and Beatriz at the check-in desk who helped me get a room as soon as possible. When I got to the room it was spacious enough. Had a bit of difficulty starting the shower (because I am dumb haha) but after a call to reception, Nicole came up to show me how it worked. Hotel had a laundry room and free breakfast was decent. Not a huge selection of food, but good enough! Hotel is located 5min walk from Vermont/Santa Monica station if you want to travel by metro. Goes quite a few places including Hollywood and is really cheap! Otherwise you can use uber or Lyft if you're not bothered with pubic transport. One evening I wanted pizza and reception helped order it for me. Any queries I had, the staff helped out and they were all lovely. Think they speak Spanish too - very useful for those who can speak Spanish and not English. Had no major problems at the hotel. Only small problem was there were works going on around the hotel therefore could be loud during the day. But when you visit, that should be all done. Did get woken up at 8am one morning by some hammering, however, when reported to reception they did explain that the works shouldn't start until 10-11am and apologised for the inconvenience.

Jeff from Perth,9,"Perth, Australia",2019-12-31,NONE,2020-01-01,2,Good access to Metro but otherwise a bad location,"This hotel does not live up to its promotional photos and advertising. 
The Pros: room and bathroom are clean. Cleaning staff are very friendly. Bed is very comfortable. Close to Metro red line. Breakfast was limited although you can get fresh omelettes made to order.
Cons: Location although close to the Metro and the LA hospital district, is not particularly good with homeless people sleeping on the streets outside,  derelict and 
 run down buildings nearby.
Hotel  interior everywhere except reception is old, dark and jaded.  Rooms and passageways are dark due to poor lighting. No ceiling lights just low wattage wall lights.
No carpets- floors are vinyl timber look. Floors and rooms are cold. Furnishings are all dark. Inside generally is a bit depressing. A/c is slow to kick in and has noisy ceiling air vents- if it is windy outside they rattle loudly. No plates or cutlery just disposable thin plastic cups. Shower is over bath- our shower head had very poor pressure although the other taps were fine. Very few power points. To charge more than one thing at the same time was a problem.  Sliding door to the balcony had a very suspect and unsafe lock.
Only one elevator down to the basement breakfast room and it was so unbelievably slow every morning I was expecting to find someone in it who had died of hunger.

The hotel provides its guest with a full breakfast which is a big surprise in today’s hospitality practices. We literally had a chef fresh cook us omelets and a waffles of different sizes. BIG PLUS. 

But the biggest selling point is how safe the hotel made is feel. 24 hour front desk help. And at night you need your key to come into the hotel the doors don’t open automatically. For 2 young females enjoying Hollywood safety is important and the Hollywood made us feel just that.

Tasha C,4,"Central Point, Oregon",2019-12-31,FAMILY,2019-12-21,3,Universal Studios vacation!,"This was a hard review.... the staff, especially Nicole and Beatriz were great!!! The room was pretty nice for the most part and clean. The breakfast was pretty good, especially the made to order waffles and omelets! This hotel is close to the metro which is a nice way to skip on all the traffic!! There is a RiteAid right next door, gas station a block away, and a bunch of quick food options close by. There is also a little shop on the first floor with GREAT prices on everything!

Now for the little less than satisfying...

The rooms had NO AC and were kinda stuffy. You could open the windows for a little airflow but there were no screens on them so that can only be for so long. The Courtyard was pretty but basically closed down with no cushions on any of the furniture. The pool was really quiet so we never actually went down to it. The property is a little hard to distinguish from the street as we were looking for what appeared to be the front from the pictures and that was actually the back of the hotel that was only accessible through a large metal gate after pressing the intercom to speak to the front desk. There are several tents around on the sidewalks and while noone approaches us at all, with a 7 year old in tow, it was a little off putting. We still felt ok walking around at night just definitely aware of our surroundings. The Metro is a couple short blocks away and while very convenient, it is also very enlightening! Other than a ride service, this is really the only option of getting to and from places unless you have your own car. 

Overall not awful, but definitely not the best either.",,,,,,,,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-04-01,"ear Guest

Jassim Al-Kanani,647,"Harrow, United Kingdom",2019-11-30,SOLO,2019-12-11,5,Fantastic stress free holiday hotel!,"Stayed at the Hollywood Hotel over the thanksgiving period. Arrived on the first night and was given a room which had one or two problems. Contacted the staff on the front desk who immediately arranged for me to change rooms. The new room was very clean and was superb. Put the original problem down to one room maybe awaiting renovation. The new room had superb beds, very good tea and coffee facilities and a large bathroom with a very powerful shower. I was aware of the charge for parking in advance and was quite happy to pay for a central location and had already received a very good rate for the room. When you add the two prices together it’s actually a very good price. The neighbourhood seemed very well policed and is conveniently positioned between two Metro Stations. Although I had a car; some journeys were twice as fast by Metro, such as Universal City. Breakfast being included in the room rate was excellent and Hugo cheerfully prepares fresh omelettes and eggs the way you like throughout the breakfast service. On thanksgiving day he prepared Pumpkin Waffles for all the guests! A really nice guy and a superb ambassador for the hotel! Nicole and Beatriz were kind and friendly and the hotel owes its first impressions to their fantastic professionalism. They offered brilliant advice on local roads, shops and how to best time visits to local museums and attractions. The hotel’s staff are it’s greatest asset and I would be very happy to stay again!

My travels have taken me to several hotels but I do admit this hotel provides a pretty good breakfast for it being included for the price of the room. 

I wouldn’t recommend the train to get around if you are alone but Uber does pick you up right at the door and drops you back off as well.

Worldtraveler2911,61,"Saskatoon, Canada",2019-12-31,COUPLES,2019-12-05,2,Average stay,"Average stay at the Hollywood hotel. Location wasn’t the best you have to rent a car. They have parking in the back but what they don’t tell you is it’s $30 a day. Breakfast was free and good. Omelette station, fresh waffles, fruit bagels cereal toast ect. The hotel is old and you can tell. The room wasn’t nice. It was small and old. Had an awkward pillar in the middle of the room that was in the way. The bathroom needs an update.  No counter space for make up room, the ceiling in the shower is cracking and crumbling. The beds are hard didn’t have a good sleep. With parking
We ended up paying $200 a night. Pretty pricy. The staff wasn’t helpful at all. Asked for a plate to microwave left over pizza and they said they didn’t have any... they left a dirty old ice bag in the room so I called and asked for a new one and they said they didn’t have any.... also room service was non existent. Didn’t get our beds made. House keeping came and took our dirty towels but didn’t leave new ones or make the bed or take the garbage out lol so I took the garbage out and left it in the hallway... ugh wouldn’t stay here again. Go here if you’re on a budget but $200 is pricy. ",,,,,,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2019-12-12,"Dear Guest,

Nicole W,64,"Arlington, Virginia",2019-11-30,NONE,2019-12-03,4,Good Place to Stay in LA,"We took a trip to LA for a little getaway from the fall chill.  We experienced lovely weather and a good experience at the Hollywood Hotel.  We ultimately chose this place due to the great price.  The room was pretty basic but was clean and the bed was comfortable.  We liked the fact that the room had a mini fridge, good wifi, and a TV that connected to our Netflix account.  The room got a little chilly at night but luckily they had a space heater in the room.  We were on the 3rd floor and our room overlooked the courtyard.  It would have been nice if the balcony had chairs or furniture... but it didn't, which we thought that was kind of strange.

We went to the pool in the evening but it was way to chilly to get in.  Too bad it wasn't a heated pool and sadly there is no hot tub.

We enjoyed the free breakfast every morning which included, made to order eggs, waffles and other options.  The tater tots were terrible (freezer burnt) the coffee was nasty, and another complaint is that it was hard to find a clean table each day.  Other than that the breakfast was good and the staff were very kind.

The location of the hotel is good.  It's a nice central location to a lot of attractions but isn't really in walking distance to many things.  We didn't have a rental car but we didn't spend too much on Uber/Lyft rides to a lot of sights.  We went to Santa Monica one day and that was a LONG and kind of expensive car ride (but totally worth it).

Overall this is a great priced hotel and not too far away from a lot of things.  We saved a lot by staying here which gave us more money to play with around town!  I loved LA and would consider staying here again if I'm trying to save a few hundred dollars.",Ask for a courtyard view,,4.0,,4.0,,4.0,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2019-12-06,"Dear Guest,

Rodrigo,1,,2019-11-30,BUSINESS,2019-11-23,1,Bad experience,"Stayed at the hotel with my wife for 16 days and it was kind of a disaster. It all started in the first week, the hotel was going through a remodeling work and guess what? They did not tell us that before we booked and pre paid for the room. At first I gave the front desk a call, and they lied saying it would only be for a couple of days. After a week the loud noises kept on bothering us, how about waking up on a Sunday at 08am with a few construction workers hammering stuff 01 feet from your door room ? I had an argument at the front desk and demanded they gave me a new room, but they said I would have to check out and wait on lobby for 4 hours before getting a new room. After insisting they told me I did not have to wait and they moved me to a new room. In the both rooms I stayed the showers did not have hot water 💧 only after 08pm. I would not recomendo anyone staying at this hotel, especially, if like is you’re a foreign. The staff does not clean well and they also don’t speak English. The only good thing about the hotel was Hugo, the omelete guy. The area is also full of homeless people and the parking costs 27 bucks a day, yeah that’s right. I’m truly thinking about suing the hotel once I get back to Brazil. I paid a lot of money for my stay and to be able to sleep well. But I Didn’t.  that’s it. It’s the worst hotel I’ve ever stayed in the USA 🇺🇸",,,,,,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2019-12-19,"Dear Guest,

Cons:
- nothing looks like any of the pictures.
- had to move rooms twice due to rooms being dirty and so loud.
- advertised double glazing and it is false. All front facing rooms are so loud with traffic and homeless fighting outside.
- rooms are very tired and bathrooms are in need of a lot of work.
- terrible and dirty bedding
- not near anything and very hard to get anywhere without driving
- location is terrible and worse than advertised.
- not at all eco with plastic cups etc in rooms.
- black mould in bathroom with a patchy shower that only sometimes works.

Pros:
- Hugo, the breakfast chef is lovely
- Pil was the only staff member to understand my wife and I didn't want to stay in a loud dirty room for our honeymoon.

Manager was extremely rude, inconsiderate and unaccommodating to all our concerns. Baby crib was dirty and held together with packing tape. Scary black mold in the bathroom. Squeaky doors. Room was super cold and only had a tiny space heater that took hours to get the room to an acceptable body temperature. Room has no closet and no draws, we had to keep our clothes and items in the suitcases. Disgustingly dirty poolside chair cushions and pool area swarmed with mosquitoes making it literally impossible to lounge poolside. Not eco friendly, all cups in the room were paper and plastic. That's just the start of it. This hotel needs a major renovation and customer hospitality attitude adjustment. It was sad and we demanded to check out early.

Goodgrub71,11,"London, United Kingdom",2019-10-31,SOLO,2019-11-11,5,A hidden gem,"So my cards are fully on the table for this review.
The location is ok, not great but ok.
The hidden gem for this Hotel is its staff.
They are so accommodating, even when you think that they have probably been asked the same questions multiple times, they go out of their way for you.
Helping with excursions, your onward journey, nothing was too much for them.
Had print outs advising me of Metro stations, advice on local food.
The breakfast was ok, its the omelette bar that takes it to another level.
The guy whose name I forget, always greeted you warmly, he knows a few languages and I could see him speak French with some other visitors.
Was nice to see, as much as we all love to go on holiday, its always nice to bump into someone who speaks your language, it engages you with that individual.
Was my first trip to Los Angeles but it will not be my last.

Mark Klein,3,,2019-11-30,NONE,2019-11-11,5,Great Value - Great Location,"Spacious, comfortable, quiet rooms in a three story property (walk up or ride elevator) with courteous staff and onsite parking available if needed.  The rooms either face a center outdoor atrium or toward exterior neighborhoods.  Southside third story exterior rooms have a great view of downtown Los Angeles.  Safe walking  neighborhoods for exercise, although not particularly scenic.  Small fridge and microwave in your room for beverages and snacks.  

Outstanding breakfast included with made to order omelets by Chef Hugo, plus Belgian Waffles, seven cereal varieties, yogurt, fruit, four juices, bagels, croissants, four breads, sliced meats and cheeses, coffee, tea, and large comfortable seating area.  Breakfast is when you realize how well this hotel appeals to International young couples, families with children, and traveling friends. This morning we were woven together with several countries and languages: Japan, Mexico, Germany, England, a Slavic country (could not detect native language), and of course the U.S.

An easy drive or shared ride to Central Hollywood attractions, and just a bit further to visit movie studios.  Lots of fun dining locations in nearby Los Feliz, Silver Lake, and Eagle Rock.  Griffith Park with multiple attractions and L.A. Dodgers stadium also just a short drive from the hotel.  About 30 minutes from downtown L.A. and all the energy of Staples Center and L.A. Live.  

If you're not trying to spend several days at the beach, this is a great place to enjoy L.A..",Third floor Southside exterior rooms have nice views of downtown L.A. (with clear air),,5.0,5.0,,5.0,,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-27,"Dear Guest,

Traveler11375,34,"New York City, New York",2019-10-31,FAMILY,2019-11-11,5,Loved the Place!,"We stayed 5 nights at the Hollywood Hotel and would absolutely stay again! It is located at about the midway point of any of the attractions of LA.   The rooms are very spacious with very comfortable beds and and beautifully decorated.  An added bonus is the delightful breakfast included with your stay.  In addition to the many breakfast items available, there is a chef who makes eggs to your specifications daily.  A very nice touch for the hotel to offer!

The hotel staff is very friendly and helpful.  Pil (yes, that's his name) gets a particular shout-out.  He made suggestions to restaurants and for places to visit.  His smile and very friendly demeaner were truly appreciated.

He helped find me a room when I had accidentally booked the wrong dates. He recommended a great dinner spot and was just generally awesome. The hotel on the other hand, was a different story. My room was quaint and cute and fulfilled my need but the rest of the hotel was dark and dirty and weird. My shower kept just randomly running at anytime. There was nothing to wipe any of the equipment down in the gym - no paper towels or spray. I let the very nice girl at the desk know and I told her the hand sanitizer was empty. She looked like she scribbled something down on a piece of paper but the next day it was still empty and no paper towels or spray. I’m not a germaphobe but that’s nasty. My bathroom floor was really dirty and I could hear street noise all night and saw two girls fighting in the street. That’s Hollywood, I guess.

Check in was very smooth and we had room 111, which was a ground floor opening onto the courtyard (though we never used it), exceptionaly clean and a comfy bed. i must say though that i would not like to have had a ground floor room at the front of the hotel, which was right next to the road and having a balcony that you would not be able to sit at or open, due to dust and traffic.

One of the main advantages to this hotel is the cost, with an exceptional breakfast and staff and the fact that the metro is literally across the road. We were able to travel downtown Los Angeles, Hollywood and Santa Monica easily. The neighbourhood is very run down, as are many areas of Los Angeles, with many homeless people and I am not sure I would have felt as safe if I had not been travelling with my husband.",,,4.0,,3.0,,4.0,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-27,"Dear Guest,

ehancock89,1,"Nashville, Tennessee",2019-11-30,COUPLES,2019-11-03,2,Shocked after reading reviews and seeing it in person.,"I chose the Hollywood Hotel after reading all the good reviews on here. But after arriving and seeing the hotel and my room I was shocked. The pictures look great online but in person it’s a little run down (you also can’t tell that the balconies are shared) My wife usually lets me do all the planning for vacations and I’m normally on top of it. But we both agreed after this trip that my streak was over. Overall the room was dirty with stains on the bed and even the lamp shade. There was mold and rust in the bathrooms. It was a toss up on if we had hot water in the morning. It was annoying at first, but it actually became comical towards the end of the trip. My sole purpose for writing this review is to give a little warning to the other husbands out there that think they’re getting a steal on the cost.  Pay a little extra and stay in a nicer hotel in a safer part of Hollywood. This hotel would be better suited towards college kids trying find a cheap hotel in Hollywood but not so much a family or a couple. Lesson learned on my part.

On a positive note, Beatriz was very sweet and helped us check in early. ",,,,,,,,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-04-17,"Dear Guest...

MittyT,1,"Cambridge, Massachusetts",2019-10-31,SOLO,2019-10-22,5,Unexpected surprise,"The hotel is unexpectedly comfortable. The area is questionable but the staff helps you feel welcome. Pil is above the rest. Through my stay he was the only one that never asked for a review. When I approached him he was genuine and helpful even when worked back to back days. 

The hotel provides breakfast but as much as it’s hyped up the chef is kinda of rude if you ask him for any extra. Since the area is downstairs you do walk away with a heavy odor or musk. But it’s worth it since you get home made breakfast.

The pool is spacious but you will get killed by the mosquitoes. But Pil did warn us and gave us some mosquito repellent wipes. 

Overall the Hotel is comfortable, the staff is pushy for reviews, but regardless some staff do earn it, like the maids, the cooks and some front desk staff. I wound come back if I’m Hollywood.",,,,,,,,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-27,"Dear Guest,

They make eggs to order, any style and they are cooked to perfection! The room is well designed and very cozy, bathrooms are beautiful, showers have great water pressure and also maintain water temperature very well (for those who like hot showers like me). Didn’t get a chance to stop by the bar but saw it and it looked very nice and cozy. Location is a little far from the airport but it’s near West Hollywood and also close to all points of interest. The hotel provides a tour service with guideline tours which was amazing! They pick you up and drop you off at the hotel so no Uber is needed. Loved the fact that the tv’s have google cast tv so I was able to watch Netflix from my phone and play it on my tv! WiFi worked excellently.

emileigh39,16,"Halifax, Canada",2019-10-31,COUPLES,2019-10-15,5,Gisele is our hero (seriously!),"We stayed here for 4 days from the 7th-11th. I was definitely apprehensive about staying here because of the mixed reviews on yelp/trip advisor but we were totally pleased with our room and stay here. 

First off, a lot of negative reviews center around the neighborhood, we liked it. It’s somewhere between little Armenia and Los Feliz, so it’s not particularly touristy which we liked!! The food and shops nearby are all very reasonably priced because they’re not inflated because of the location. It’s also in a great spot if you want a good view of the Hollywood sign, and it’s not a far drive from the walk of fame and the more touristy areas. There are lots of great restaurants nearby within walking distance, I suggest trying some of the el Salvadoran and Mexican food in the area.

I used the pool once and it was clean and not too crowded. There’s a beautiful courtyard which we had a view of from the balcony, we had takeout food one night and ate it out there and it was serene. Our room was modern and clean, it was a reasonable size with a large balcony (although the balcony didn’t have any furniture on it which would’ve been nice). Another nice touxh was that the bath and shower amenities were very high quality and smelled great. 

This is more like a 4.5 star review rather than a 5 because it wasn’t without its flaws ... the first being the very slow elevators, the other being that the electrical port in the lamps was very worn out and didn’t work very well. The tiles in the shower could use a redo as they were a bit dated. 

We just wanted to thank Gisele personally in this review since we didn’t get a chance to in person! We went to a music festival last weekend and on the way to the festival my boyfriend left his phone in the Uber, rather than having the Uber driver drop the phone off all the way to the festival (2 hours away), we asked gisele if it was ok if he could drop it off at the hotel and we could come get it Monday when the festival was over, she was totally fine with this and kept it safe for us until Monday. We needed a spot to stay on Sunday night as we had to leave the festival early, and liked this hotel so much we booked another night here. We’re planning another trip in January and would not hesitate to rebook.",,,,,,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2019-10-17,"Dear Guest,

Nice and friendly staff, great breakfast, pub in the evenings, souvenir shop, pool area, big parking with automated gates. The area outside the hotel didn't feel like something we wanted to explore by foot so we used the car every day.

The biggest downside is the very expensive parking fee of 30 USD. There are parkings on the streets outside so if you're ok with finding your own parking spot and walk to the hotel you got some big savings heading your way. There is an ATM at the hotel which charges 5 USD for withdrawal. Water automats on every floor.

The Rooms
Great beds and good daily cleaning. We did not like the shared pathway outside our balcony door, although we rarely noticed anyone out there. Also the entry to the shower was way to small for big sized persons. Safe and fridge on the room. 

Food
The breakfast is awesome! The omelette chef Hugo makes The Best omelettes I've ever had, and the waffles with new flavor every day, were great. My wife choose the scrambled eggs which, of course, were great as well. We Love You Hugo <3 <3 <3 

Distance
45 minutes from LAX with multiple routes to choose from. 15 minutes from Hollywood & Highland, another 15 minutes from Universal City, 20 minutes from Los Angeles downtown and about 40 minutes to Santa Monica. All distances with car using Google navigation with real time traffic updates.

NostromoLondon,187,"Sanderstead, United Kingdom",2019-09-30,COUPLES,2019-09-30,3,Mixed Bag,"Stayed here for four nights on holiday with my husband. 

First the good points:
Room was pretty spacious and well equipped. Nice toiletries, plenty of towels, fridge, microwave (although this needed a clean), Starbucks coffee for machine.

Complimentary breakfast with freshly made eggs; omelettes, scrambled, fried etc and also waffles made to order. Wide range of bread for toast. Bagels and muffins. Fruits. Potatoes and sausages. Cheese, ham, preserves etc and coffee. 

Staff were pretty friendly and helpful. 

Good location near metro and the area overall was pretty decent.

Now the bad:
Husband accumulated over 60 insect bites by the pool one afternoon. No advice on check in or warnings or the mosquito epidemic which they were aware of. Also no pre preventative measures taken by hotel around the pool. Response when raised was pretty much we don’t care. Nothing we can do. Having travelled extensively to mosquito ridden countries we’ve never experienced attacks like this. 

At least warn people that there’s an issue.

Beds were very hard and pillows like paper.

Attempting to retrieve bags from the store when leaving was a hassle. 

A few small improvements could make this really good.",,,,,,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2019-10-14,"Dear Guest..

We do apologize for the fact that your stay did not match your expectations! We are so sorry for the mosquitos.  We find mosquitoes in Los Angeles all spring and summer long, due to the rise of temperature. This is unfortunately something that we don't have under our control.

HannaB,1,"San Bernardino, California",2019-09-30,COUPLES,2019-09-29,5,Great Vibes,"Came in for a show at the Greek, for the price, amenities and closeness to the show we booked for 1 night it was the RIGHT CHOICE. The hotel is wonderful and the rooms are so quiet. At check in we met the famous Pil and to be honest he does live up to all his reviews. He set us up in room 129 and it was like a heavenly cave. After the show we slept like babies in our room. 

Then to our next surprise THE BREAKFAST OMG it is to die for. Freshly made omelets and waffles. Coffee (which was much needed ) fresh and HOT. After a full belly we walked up to reception and Pil was still there. 

We loved it so much we booked another night. Needless to say we recommend this hotel highly and will make it our go to for all our stay in Hollywood.",,,,,,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2019-10-14,"Dear Guest,

Juli Vazquez,1,,2019-09-30,COUPLES,2019-09-28,5,Great Staff/Reasonable Price,"My husband and I visited this hotel for our 4 year anniversary, as most Hollywood area hotels were extremely pricey I decided to book our stay here as the price seemed reasonable and the hotel had great amenities. Upon arriving staff was friendly, room was clean, small but I was more concerned about the cleanliness of the hotel and it definitely exceeded my expectations. Fitness center, free breakfast, and gated parking (downside is you have to pay but it’s totally worth it because neighborhood isn’t the greatest), and room had good amenities (mini fridge/microwave). Our morning maid was the sweetest, and Hugo the chef was amazing, super friendly and had the best attitude making everyone’s eggs/omelettes. Did I mention they make your eggs/omelettes/fresh waffles in front of you during breakfast ☺️ Should I mention this hotel has amazing staff, I accidentally dropped money in the lobby and they immediately called me and returned money as it was caught on camera, kudos to you guys for being so honest and trustworthy!!",,,,,,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2019-10-25,"Dear Guest,

Kerri K,1,,2019-09-30,FAMILY,2019-09-26,1,This is not a family hotel!!,"I looked at reviews on this hotel & they were all pretty good with the pros & cons so I decided to go for it! This is NOT a place to take your family!! There aren’t any restaurants in walking distance & if there were you sure don’t want to walk there with your family.....it’s a very shady neighborhood. You have to Uber or Lyft to get to any kind of restaurant or bar.....or anywhere. I was able to look past that until the rest of the amenities fell through. Every single vending machine on every floor was either empty or didn’t work......we couldn’t even get a water or snack for the kids. They also advertised they had a bar/lounge. Upon arrival they informed us it wasn’t open till Wednesday, when Wednesday rolled around they were still not open. The people walking around once the sun went down we’re something you don’t want your children to see. My husband & I saw drug related activity off our balcony that as an adult I did not want to see. It’s a beautiful hotel.......if your going to advertise being a family hotel you need to make sure it’s for families!

In reality it wasn’t very nice! Our room, and therefore all our belongings became infested with ants from their drains (pics attached). Most of the facilities are okay but the rooms are in horrible decorative order and didn’t feel very clean. This therefore made me not want to use the pool. If you get an outside room rather than a courtyard it’s also incredibly noisy!
The hotel kept turning our electricity off so our phones wouldn’t charge over night. I rang 4 times to ask them to stop turning it off until they admitted they were via their computer systems, very strange!",,,,,,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2019-10-14,"Dear Guest..

sarahtilley82,9,"Everett, Washington",2019-09-30,NONE,2019-09-22,2,Beware!  The pictures are different online than what you see in person!,"My husband and I came to Hollywood celebrating our wedding anniversary.  We stayed Sept. 14th-19th.  This hotel looked really nice on the website and got mostly good reviews, included a buffet breakfast, a pool, a restaurant along with a courtyard bar and A/C.  I thought it was a great deal.  We arrive and were told that the restaurant was closed due to a power outage.  Also only ONE working elevator for three floors!  That was very inconvenient because the elevator that was working was very slow so we took the stairs a lot.  The courtyard bar was having happy hour between 2 to 7pm daily.  First day we go out there, there was no one around and we noticed there were appetizers sitting out that was covered in flies!  We decided to check out the pool.  Pool area looked nice...BUT you couldn't sit in the lounge chairs without getting eaten alive by huge aggressive mosquitos that left huge bites on you.  We stayed in a standard queen room with a balcony overlooking the street.  Our room was clean, but noticed there was chipped paint throughout room, black scuff marks on the walls, rust on the ceiling of the shower area, etc.  Our balcony didn't have chairs out there to sit in, the bed was the worst - felt like we were sleeping on a slab of concrete and woke up sore each day.  You either need a car, take the bus or get an Uber/Lyft to get to major attractions.  There is a Rite Aid about a block away that you can get basic needs from which was convenient.  The breakfast buffet was great and had a large variety to choose from.  The staff was nice and the maids did a great job cleaning our room each day.  This hotel also charges $27 a night to park your car.  Overall, I wouldn't stay at this hotel again.

The Hotel is lovely but I still feel a little over priced, the area it is situated in has an extremely high amount of homeless people on the street so going out on the evening was a little concerning.

We stayed for 3 nights and was happy with our room, the pool area was nice to but quite small and a little dated with bad taste of 80's music playing.

The bar staff were great and we stayed one evening for the comedy which was pretty cool to but some comedians were too political and that isn't comedy for me.

Hotel is close to a metro station so easy to get around.  Nice spacious parking area if required too.

Ellie,7,,2019-08-31,NONE,2019-08-27,4,A reasonably-priced hotel,"Our family of 3 decided to stay at the Hollywood Hotel for our 1 week trip to LA. We booked early so we had a 50% discount of the regular price. The free breakfast was one of the biggest highlights, as it offered many different filling options! There was a huge selection (around 7 or 8) different types of cereals, bagels, breads, tater tots, and you could also request the chef for eggs cooked in which ever way you like (scrambled, omelettes, poached etc.), as well as waffles (including flavours like chocolate, strawberry, and cinnamon switched between the days). Breakfast was served from 6:30 to 10:30, which was more than enough time for us to grab an early bite and head on out with our bellies full. 

The room itself was very clean and was decently sized (we got one room with 2 queen beds). The bathroom was small but had a nice walk in shower (although the shower can vary room to room). There was an ironing board and iron, although we didn't use it. There was also space to hang your clothes which was very nice. The hotel itself was very old, and none of the rooms had lights on the ceiling, instead having several lamps around the room. This would've been fine, however, not all of the lamps had been working. There were around 5-6 lamps in total, and in the beginning only half had worked, but when we told the staff they fixed all of them except for one. Another issue we had was the safe, which wasn't working the day we checked in (previous visitors left the safe locked). We called the staff and they sent someone to come and fix it the next morning. It worked in the end, and although it was small, it carried the few valuables that we had. There was also a hair dryer in the bathroom, but it didn't work, although we didn't need it often. The nightly fee for parking was a bit much, but there's public parking right next to the hotel (free at night, meter during the day) that we used for the two nights we rented a car. We didn't like the way that the hotel seemed very dimmed in the hallways but we didn't spend much time there so it didn't matter that much. The elevators were also very slow to respond which is why we ended up using the stairs quite a few times instead. It was quite frustrating having to wait for the elevator for so long. 

There were also several food options near the hotel, like fast foods, pizza places, and Chinese food. The neighbourhood wasn't the prettiest place in LA, but it wasn't entirely unsafe and it was a relatively convenient location as well. The metro was a short drive away (~5-10 mins max), although we mostly travelled using Uber. 

Overall, this hotel provided a lovely stay for our family! The breakfast was very filling, and the staff was all very friendly and helpful. The rooms were very clean as well! I highly recommend if you're looking for a more affordable hotel in LA.",,,5.0,5.0,,,4.0,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2019-08-29,"Dear Guest,

We didn't complain but were given a new room the following day. Due to a housekeeping mix up, the new room wasn't cleaned and we were forced to take a noisy street level room next to the stairwell. The following day, the guest clerk who had arranged for us to move to a nicer room greeted us with the news that due to our inconvenience, he was arranging for us to move to a suite. He was very embarrassed, and actually had come in the night before at midnight to sort out what happened. He had left clear instructions with the evening desk clerk, but there was nothing they could do. Not only did he go above and beyond - we had never complained - he escorted us to the room himself and had taken it upon himself to be sure it was 100% ready for us. He also checked with us each time we crossed paths to make sure we were okay. He went above and beyond, and reinforced my opinion that this will be my go-to hotel for every LA trip.

Very friendly employees. They have a laundry room which come in handy during a vacation in case you didn’t pack extra outfits. Breakfast was horrible, very untasted. We tried it the first day, but we skipped it then.  ",,,,,,,,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-04-01,"ear Guest

The hotel is good. Room is quaint but clean, bathroom could use a little updating. The beds are interesting when you first sit on it feels firm, but once you lay down they're comfortable. The staff was super friendly we were greeted by Pil who helped us with check-in.

Complimentary breakfast was good.

Felt safe parking the car in the onsite parking lot, as the area is not that great. It is located in a good spot though. We visited Koreatown and Universal Studios, the hotel is about 15 mins. from each location.

Dreamer284545,17,,2019-07-31,FAMILY,2019-07-27,5,Recommended,"My 18yr old daughter and I chose this hotel because of it's proximity to a lot of tourist attractions since we were going to be using public transportation, the hot breakfast that was included and the reasonable cost.  Check-in was easy; the hotel staff was pleasant and helpful.  Beatriz helped us when we had a 3-hour wait before we left for LAX, and Nancy gave lots of great recommendations on traveling around especially since we were relying on public transportation.  The other hotel staff was friendly, engaging and always welcomed us back to the hotel whenever we were out. Our room was clean, had a safe, fridge, microwave, tea & coffee maker.  There are also laundry facilities on site which we used while we were having breakfast.  The breakfast had a good variety of food from cereal to bagels/toast to waffles and omelets...and the omelets were excellent.  It was fun to order a different omelet every day.  There was a nice outdoor pool and a large number of loungers.

Negatives:
1.  Pillows should have pillow protectors on them.  Also, some of the pillows needed to be replaced as there was very little stuffing left in them.
2.  It would have been great to have use of the pool up to 10 pm.  Many times we came home from sightseeing about 8:30 - 9:00 pm and there was no chance to take a quick dip.

Positives:
1.  Friendly, helpful, engaging staff
2.  Excellent omelets
3.  Proximity to bus and subway transportation
4.  The excellent soundtrack being pumped throughout the pillow area
5.  A bonus was the cold water provided poolside
6.  Riteaid (located a block away) offers a discount to hotel guests

binsy46,40,"Melbourne, Australia",2019-07-31,FAMILY,2019-07-24,3,Pretty Average,"Staying for 6 nights with my son.  We took a fly away coach from Lax to union street station which was $10.  We got on the red line underground line to Vermont/sunset station $2.75 each then walked down the hill to the hotel.  We’ve never been before, we are pretty resourceful and we found this trip from Lax pretty easy.

Room was ok nothing special but clean.  Was overlooking the car park.  Beds comfy and room service made up our room.  The air conditioning in the room works well but is the loudest air conditioning unit I’ve ever heard. Microwave, fridge and safe in the room.  Some sort of coffee maker but the coffee is horrible.

Pool is clean, sun beds clean and towels provided.  Pretty quiet round the pool.  Used the gym which is pretty small with minimal equipment but has What you would need.

Breakfast is fine and will get you by.  I know it says free complimentary breakfast but nothing is for free and I would suggest that they account for this in the room price.

Metro bus stop outside.  We walked to Hollywood walk if fame (disappointing) which seemed to take forever but is walkable if you really feel the need to go. Took bus 704 west off sunset which took us to Santa Monica pier in about an hour and you can get off in the way.  Fair full day cost $5.00.

There is nothing to do in the local area, I certainly would not be walking round here on an evening.  I ran across the road to the local liquor store for chocolate and I did not feel safe.  There is very little food options without a car.

I wouldn’t stay here again but it would be more to do with the location rather than the hotel itself.",,,,,,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2019-07-29,"Dear Guest,

hleahh,115,"West Hartford, Connecticut",2019-07-31,FAMILY,2019-07-22,2,Hmmm... not as advertised ,"When we got to the hotel, it was not as nice as it looks on the website. Our room was not in great shape. Aside from being small, a bit shabby, lacking the advertised amenities, it also had lots of little bugs in the shower. My husband thought they might be fleas but we don’t know. When we checked in, it was already quite late, but my husband did not want to bring any bugs home with us. So we he went down to the desk to ask about a new room, but they did not have a another available room with 2 queens. After some talking, they did graciously give us 2 rooms with 1 bed each so we split up with our kids.  The two new rooms did not have bugs — hooray! But they were a bit shabby. The room my husband and daughter had clearly had had updates, but it still did not have a great paint job, tiling, etc. The other room was again very shabby.

By morning, a manager came up and graciously offered to let us out of our second prepaid night. 

We skipped breakfast here because we were just too grossed out by the hotel. Then we checked into the Hyatt Place in Glendale — a huge improvement! Honestly, the Hollywood Hotel has lots of potential; it just needs some careful renovating.",,,,,,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2019-07-29,"

SAORI Y,19,"Auckland, New Zealand",2019-07-31,FAMILY,2019-07-18,3,スタッフの対応がイマイチ,"2歳の子どもと一緒に8日間宿泊しました。朝ご飯つきはありがたかったですが、オムレツを焼いてくれるシェフの方がかなり愛想悪いです。ビュッフェの内容は、パンとベーコン、ハッシュドポテトとチーズという非常にベーシックです。部屋はWIFI環境が悪く、中々アクセスできませんでした。また、フロントデスクの対応も悪く、なんだかなーといった感じです。ホテルにコインランドリーはありますが、しっかりとメンテンナンスされておらず、コインを入れて洗剤を買おうとしても販売機から出てきませんでした。フロントに聞くと「在庫切れです」とこれまた不愛想に言われ、結局ホテルの向かいのコインランドリーまで行く羽目に。オフィシャルサイトから予約したため、特典付きだったのですが、この特典についてもフロントデスクは全く把握しておらず会話にならなくて残念でした。
We stayed with toddler for 8 nights. It was good to have free bfast buffet, but the chef who cooks omelette was so unfriendly and looked so mad or something. not for 1day but everyday. The menu of buffet was quite basic- bread, bacon, cheese and some potato. Wifi was quite slow and lost network quite often. The staff at front desk was unfriendly and unhelpful. There was 3girls and one of them was looks like trainee. other 2 girls were just taking care of that girl and the guests in the queue were ignored. They have coin laundry but not managing well. I put coins in vending machine to buy detergent but nothing came out. It's ok that they don't have stock, but they could place any paper or tag which says 'out of stock'",,,1.0,3.0,,3.0,,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-04-17,"お客様へ、

This hotel was perfect for what we needed. We came early to lounge at the pool, then checked into the room, then went to the game. The pool area is nice. The outside of the hotel and the hallways could use a make over, but rooms were somewhat recently redesigned and modern looking. Neighborhood was ok, not sure I would have walked around too much at night. We took an Uber to the game which was only about a 10-15 min ride with game traffic. Also, the room came with free breakfast which was really good and I considered a huge plus. Overall we booked this hotel because it was cheaper than others in the area and I was very happy with our stay. Would stay again if ever in the area and had a need.

Tom S,14,"Boston, Massachusetts",2019-06-30,FAMILY,2019-07-07,5,This Hotel is a find in L.A.,"I have seen the Hollywood Hotel come up on searches before, but I thought it was too far East to be convenient and, for the price, I was sure it just could not be that good.  Wrong again Mister !

This hotel is a little gem.  Clean and very well-appointed rooms each have quality linens and the center courtyard, which the guests actually use, is open to the sky and allows your room to get a fresh air breeze.   Large palms and comfortable seating make this a natural destination for your reading or catch up on e-mails time. ( Oh yes, and the WIFI is free. )

The bar downstairs is great - live comedy on Wednesday nights.  I caught a couple of fresh young comics trying out their material; it was so fun, so L.A.  In the morning the hotel offers a free breakfast which is not just a bowl of fruit loops, I mean custom omelets, big waffles and bowls of fresh fruit, I was so pleasantly surprised.

Good water pressure leads to a great shower and the Pool out back is amazingly lovely catching sun all morning.

The staff was polite and professional, and, for the price, this very family friendly hotel is a great find.",Ask for a room that opens onto the courtyard.,,5.0,,3.0,5.0,,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-27,"Dear Guest,

They also helped with the parking - there is a secure car park at rear costs $27 a day. Our room felt small compared to other hotels we had stayed in and the decor was 'tired'. There was very little space for our suitcases and hanging space for clothes was a rail over a sideboard and the ironing board and iron were stored in the space.. The bathroom was also small. We overlooked a small courtyard which is very pleasant  - they advertised a welcome drink between 5-7 but this never materialised the two nights we stayed. The breakfast was okay - reasonable choice and the chef on duty works really really hard cooking fresh omelottes and waffles. There are several places to eat within easy walking distance - there's a Wendy's, and then Le Figaro, a fabulous French bistro and an Italian. Lovely food. It's also not far to bus stops and the metro. The pool area was okay - the sunbeds are heavy and difficult to move around. Towels are provided. The staff were great apart from an older woman whoi we overheard speaking to others and we thought her very rude.

If it weren’t for the few jerks I’d give this property a five.  If you have a car, prepare to have to pay $27/night for parking.",,,,,,,,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-27,"Dear Guest,

Phylde,89,"Hesperia, California",2019-06-30,FAMILY,2019-06-17,3,AVERAGE,"We made reservations with this hotel because my husband was having 2 procedures done at Kaiser Sunset which was a couple of blocks away.  We booked with a non-refundable rate.  After we made the reservation we got a email from the hotel showing all of the ""extra charges"" like parking in their parking lot $27 + tax a night. We had a 7lb dog with us & were told there was a $50 + tax a night cleaning
fee for her.  We got there after 3pm & checked in, went to WaBa & got take out.  Came back, ate our food & went to bed. Our little dog slept in her canvas crate & was not out in the room.  The next morning my husband had his first appointment at 7am so we left at about 6:30am & I told the front desk we didn't need housekeeping.  Our dog was left in her crate the whole time we were gone.  My husband wasn't released from the hospital until 7:30pm.  We checked out before 8am the next morning.  Our dog is a little Diva & she will not walk on tile or wood floors so she was either in her crate or on her little blanket.  When I was checking out I asked if we could get a refund on one night dog cleaning because the room hadn't been cleaned.  Plus you would not have been able to tell that a dog had been in the room.  I was told no, that is their policy.  We didn't get to take advantage of anything else but the room & ice machine.  The hotel is older & in the downtown area. We ended up paying $535 after they added on all their extras.  When you look at the web site it doesn't say there are extra charges for a lot of things.  They should be more upfront, in my opinion.",,,,,,,,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-04-01,"ear Guest

Michelle216,42,"Bunbury, Australia",2019-06-30,COUPLES,2019-06-14,1,Dreadful Hotel. ,"This hotel is one of the worst hotels that 
I have stayed in lately. ( I am a frequent traveler) I would not recommend it to anyone. 
The area is a medical district. Not for tourism. Very seedy. 
Far away from tourist areas. 
Reception are very abrupt. Not at all helpful. 
The building is old. Maintenance is ok. 
What you expect for their ratings. 
In the rooms you have soft plastic cups. And only one each, per stay. 
No glasses available. I was told to go buy them at the nearby store!!
Car parking is us$28.00 per night. (Compared to us$25 per day for our hire car)
The last day, we returned to our room & found the housemaid had locked herself into our room. And when we entered, our bags had been searched!! Thankfully only a small amount of money was missing. 
The only positive; The beds are ok. 
Quite soft. And breakfast is fairly good. 

But please do yourself a favor. For what works out to Au$200.00 a night, stay somewhere else. ",,,,,,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2019-10-29,"Dear Guest,

We were late arriving and yet Brian had everything ready for me to make check in very smooth. He was so helpful and had great advice on where to go, how to get there, and what to do. He was so informative and was just so peasant.  We had spent the day traveling on Route 66 and he made sure to give me the history of the hotel being on Route 66 and told us to make sure and visit Santa Monica Pier.  Started our first night in Hollywood out great!  Felt safe with secured parking.  The room was larger than expected and even had a balcony. Love the toiletries that are provided. Smells so yummy!  Everything is clean and beds are comfortable. Having a microwave and mini fridge is convenient for a family. Has a very old Hollywood feel to it. We are very happy!  Free breakfast and free WiFi. Highly, highly recommend.  Thank you, Brian, for starting our Hollywood vacation off the best way possible.",,,,,,,,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-27,"Dear Guest,

Henry W,1,,2019-06-30,COUPLES,2019-06-08,1,Terrible Customer Service ,"We had issues to check in to the hotel as the first name showed on the booking confirmation is not matching my legal first name. 

The front desk officer, Ali and his supervisor didn’t try to help us solve our problem. Just told us to call Agoda and change the booking name. We felt he is unhelpful and we are very disappointed with this type of service. 

We had to call Agoda multiple times to resolve this issue and finally we asked Agoda to give the hotel a call to explain the situation.

So, at the end we are allowed to check in but we are extremely unhappy with Ali’s behaviour!

The worst part during our stay was the power was disconnected at the middle of the night, and I had to run to the front desk multiple times and asked for assistance. Ryan, the front desk officer told me that he didn’t has a solution for me and I had to deal with this situation as the technician can only come to fix it at the next day. So, I requested him to find another room for me. At the end, we moved to another room. However, the nightmare wasn’t stop. There was no water from the shower in the new room! But we were just too tired to make another complaint since we were going to check out in the morning. 

What a terrible experience!

We are glad that we only stay two nights in this hotel!

Daniel C,3,"Palm Springs, California",2019-05-31,NONE,2019-05-22,4,Pleasant Surprise,"I was pleasantly surprised.  I expected a motel-like property. However, it is a small full-service hotel.   It is a well kept, yet a little dated.  My check-in was positive.  I was greeted by the desk receptionist, Pil.  He was very positive and helpful.  What's more, he went out of his way to help me with a future stay.  I must spend three days in the area because my partner was having surgery in a hospital a few blocks down the street.  I asked if there was a  lower rate for such circumstances.  I had already booked on-line.  He spent some time on the computer and offered me a room at a very reasonable rate compared to my own booking.  It certainly relieved some of the anxiety I was already feeling because of the surgery in the next few weeks.  I appreciate going out of his way.  What's more, I enjoyed the hotel stay.  It included a very nice breakfast with an omelet and waffle station manned by a cook/chef who prepared at the station.  He  was quite personable.  Staff was friendly and greeted people as they walked by  Rooms were basic yet clean and comfortable.  Included is a gym, nice pool area, beautiful courtyard with a bar open in the evenings.

Lew B,140,"Palm Springs, California",2019-05-31,COUPLES,2019-05-17,1,Terrible,"The expression ""you get what you pay for"" certainly applies to the Hollywood Hotel.  We usually stay at high end hotels.  This was a quick trip to LA for a few days where we knew we would be out most of the time.  We booked this as it seemed to be a cost effective place.  Even though the price was reasonable, it was not worth it.

We knew this was a budget priced hotel and did not attempt to compare it to the high end, luxury hotels we usually frequent.  However, terrible is terrible.

We had booked a queen suite.  The bed was not a queen, but a full size.  For two adults, it was extremely tight.  We complained to the manager who argued that the bed was a queen.  It absolutely was not.  

The suite had one chair and the bed.  There was no other place to sit.  

The outside of the building is attractive.  However, the room and bathroom were old and worn out.

The positives:  the breakfast was excellent (included in the price.)  The coffee in the room was Starbuck's!",stay somewhere else,2.0,2.0,,,,2.0,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2019-10-29,"Dear Guest,

The room wasn't what I was expecting  the bathroom was outdated and run down but overall the room was clean and the workers cleaned my room everyday which was a plus and they were friendly. Breakfast was good. I went to the bar downstairs and every drink I ordered I found a bug in it (fruit fly maybe)  but the bartender was nice and always made me a new one. overall the hotel and workers were nice and The hotel itself wasn't a bad experience. The area itself is disgusting!!! Homeless and DRUG ADDICTS everywhere, Garbage on the streets definitely not what I was expecting I am from New York where I'm ""supposed"" to be used to this but I never seen anything like this.

Ashleigh K,7,,2019-04-30,COUPLES,2019-05-13,5,2nd time here we love it!!,"So... I never usually write reviews unless I feel somewhere really deserves it.

First shout out to Nicole on reception, who got us checked in early for no extra cost around 9am after getting off a 13 hour flight from Australia. Nicole greeted us with a smile and we felt like we truly were starting our holiday.

We have actually stayed at the Hollywood hotel previously two years before. We loved it, and came back and spent two full weeks at the hotel this time as oppose to only the 4 days previously. We even got the EXACT same room 240, which we loved because it was more private away from the others so we could sleep. 
The only downfall was when people wandered up and down the corridor talking on their phones they tended to head to our side of the hotel because there was a small patio by our room.

Housekeeping were in top form. Every day we had our bed refreshed, our bins emptied and bathroom cleaned. These little touches make you feel on holiday. We didn’t need the air con apart from one night, it was a noisy system so maybe that would be a problem but for us we only used it once. 

Breakfast was great! Omelettes to order, cereals and croissants. It was great every morning having something to eat before leaving the hotel. 

Now I hear people say on here it’s a pretty seedy area. I used to live in LA, so I was aware of my surrounding more so than a tourist would be, I guess. The area is really like anywhere down town Hollywood to be honest. 
Most of LA has its areas, Anywhere after dark comes across intimidating, if that’s the correct word. We walked everywhere so we walked home at nights from the two train stations near by the sunset/Vermont and the Santa Monica/ Vermont line which runs into the Hollywood strip/ universal studios/ down town LA. Both only 10min walks to the hotel. There are also bus stops. So if you don’t have a car, like we didn’t you can always use public transport. It is there . Uber for later nights.

We used the little shop in the hotel too which is very reasonably priced compared to some shops and the gentleman in there is wonderful and was even recommending newer hikes to us we hadn’t done in the years previously 

Since we were there two weeks, by the second week it felt very comfortable and relaxing to me. 

Even on the day we left our flight wasn’t till late evening, so Nicole put our bags in storage so we could come back for them. 

Final shout out to Pil, who always greeted us ladies with a hi and a smile no matter the time of night or day and nothing was a bother :) 

Thanks folks for another wonderful stay. We hope to be back with you soon! ",,,,,,,,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-27,"Dear Guest,

We immediately recognised the infamous Phil who checked us in. He is a top bloke and always said “morning” to us. 

Hotel is clean. Pool area is lovely, secure and comfortable.

Breakfast is a lovely added touch, especially considering it is free. We ate breakfast in the hotel twice and was happy with what was on offer (Hot drinks, juices, omelette station, waffle station, sausages, mini hash browns, fruits, yogurts, cereals, variety of breads, cold meats and cheeses. 

Hotel room was comfy and clean. Maid service cleaned it daily with fresh linen and towels. Very friendly. Great air con, iron and ironing board already in the room which is an added bonus! Balcony overlooking the tranquil courtyard. TV is good size and supports google chrome cast.

Jillian Iva,2,"Seattle, Washington",2019-04-30,BUSINESS,2019-04-26,5,Top notch customer service at a relaxing hotel,"My friend and I who have not connected in some time came to LA for a movie premier. We wanted someplace close to the Hollywood happenings but that was also not over the top expensive. The Hollywood Hotel went above and beyond to make our stay great! The gentleman who helped us is named Pil, and he was awesome, warm and accommodating from the moment we walked in the door. We had an ADA room since they were sold out, but he said if we weren't happy to come see him the next day, and he'd happily switch rooms for us. Pil even took time to show me room options the next day, but we decided to stay in our room as it was very spacious. Pil was great to remind us daily to not miss the awesome free breakfast (omelet bar, waffles...the works!). 

I was surprised how quiet the room was, and the pool did not disappoint!! We booked for three nights and really enjoyed the days by the pool. Our thoughts were to splurge the last night and stay at the Roosevelt, but after such a great stay, we decided to stay one more night and booked the hotel for a fourth night. Pil went above an beyond to get us a great rate in an awesome room...and it was an upgrade (hello jacuzzi suite)!

I'd suggest to splurge and get a Luminary room. They've been in the process of remodeling their rooms, and those are the most up to date. Our original room showed some wear and tear, but was super clean and the beds ruled. Again, Pil went above and beyond to show me the rooms and explain the layouts, so that's why I have that info. He's the best, and we so appreciate his level of customer service!!",Choose a Luminary room if you can.

K1MMY,16,"Cardiff, United Kingdom",2019-04-30,COUPLES,2019-04-25,4,Comfortable stay,"We stayed at the Hollywood Hotel for 8 nights. It's located in East Hollywood and only a few minutes walk to the Metro that allowed us to travel to Hollywood/Universal City and other locations quite easily.
Hotel staff were very welcoming and always had to the time to say hello as we were passing through reception.
We stayed on the 3rd  floor, standard double room which overlooked the courtyard. Rooms were a good size, clean with a comfy bed, power shower and large bathroom and good A/C. Some of the decor looked a little tired in places and the Google cromecast hit and miss at times.
We had breakfast a couple of times. Was okay but nothing to shout about so we ate out mostly.
Lovely pool area with plenty of loungers, music playing and clean towels to use. 
Hotel comes with guest laundry which was really handy to have at $3.50 per wash/dry. Floors also have vending machine with water/pop/snacks and a small shop too.
All in all, a very comfortable and pleasant stay. Would definitely recommend to anyone thinking of visiting LA. Thanks :)

william a,1,"Woodridge, Illinois",2019-03-31,COUPLES,2019-04-10,4,Staff and location win at this well-restored hotel,"We arrived late at night and pretty exhausted. Pil, who with Brian was on the front desk, was welcoming, patient, helpful and very friendly. We asked for a quieter room than what we had reserved, but after telling us the house was nearly full, Pil did manage to find us a room that was, until the next day at least, very quiet. The following morning an incredibly loud family arrived across the hall, revealing that the doors are the weak point in the sound-abatement strategy. 

We were sick and in bed the following day. The staff could not have been nicer: they turned down the piped-in music in the courtyard on my first request and offered to get us any meds or comfort foods that might help. I discovered several restaurants in the immediate area and brought back a lunch that we ate in the beautiful courtyard next to a bubbling fountain--perfect for beginning the healing process. 

The room was clean, if on the small side, the queen bed fairly comfortable, and the bathroom roomy and sparkling clean. Internet service was quite good after a slow log-on process. 

The breakfast was not up to the standard of the rest of the place. Custom omelettes were a nice touch but the rest of the offerings--no fresh fruit for instance--were not very different from the last Fairfield Inn I visited. 

Overall, a nice, even beautiful place, well-situated near restaurants and Griffith Park; but the friendliness of the staff made it memorable for us.",,,,,,,,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-30,"Dear Guest,

arorabajaj,29,"Lucknow, India",2019-04-30,COUPLES,2019-04-09,2,Average bed and breakfast,I booked this hotel after reading reviews on tripadvisor. The only plus point was its proximity to the metro station. Rest I did not feel it was a hotel. It gave the feeling of an avrage bed and breakfast. Right from the staff at the front desk to the house keeping all are always ready to say no. We asked for an extra stool to keep our luggage as I had a back problem and could not bend. The plain answer was no. The room size was good. But there are no cupboards. Its all in the open. The bed was ok although the pillows were horrible. Requested to change them but they did not. They say that breakfast is free however there is nothing much than an omelette and waffle station. Breakfast is till 1030 but if you reach till 930 the fruits and breads are all finished and nobody even bothers to replenish them. Cold cuts are there but with constant flies wandering over them. Sometimes we even had to clean and clear the tables ourselves as there was no one to do so. Totally not worth the price you pay for. Especially after returning from Vegas were the hospitality was impeccable. Would never like to return again. And would certainly not recommend.,,,,,,,,,,,,15

Distance to walk of fame is about 10 mins in an Uber which cost about 8 dollars or so, no biggie.
This is a family run Hotel and the difference is huge when it comes to care and service
The Hotel is spotless with the cleaners doing an impeccable job every day , thank you ladies
The reception staff are really helpful and Pil in particular went above and beyond to make sure I got a great rate for my extended visit, thank you Pil and the other lovely receptionists.
I need to mention the Chef, He makes by and far the BEST omelettes and waffles for breakfast , handling a whole room of breakfasteers with patience and courtesy, Thank you so much
I guess you can tell that I would DEFINATELY recommend this hotel to anyone looking for 5 star service at 3 star cost ❤️",,,,,,,,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-27,"Dear Guest,

Noelani Youngblood,6,,2019-02-28,SOLO,2019-02-23,5,Excellent Customer Service,"I originally planned to stay in an Air Bnb but upon arrival (after a very long drive) the key provided to me was not working. Not from the area, anxious and looking for a decent hotel nearby, I sought out Hollywood Hotel. From the moment I walked in, I was greeted and helped by Brian at the front desk who helped me find a room that fit for me at an affordable price. Being that it was 1am when I finally arrived, I assumed no one would be willing to hear me out or help me find the right room. Brian was more than ready to help me get into a room—in addition to listening to me vent! The room was very well laid out and I felt very at home. It was more than enough space and very clean! While I do not travel to Silverlake often, I will be booking here from now on when I am in town :) thanks for everything!!",,,,,,,,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-27,"Dear Guest,

im-Betty-kitten,7,"Hove, United Kingdom",2019-02-28,FAMILY,2019-02-18,1,Do not stay here!,"Frankly one of the worst hotels I’ve stayed in ever. Upon arrival the hotel staff almost seemed put out to check us in. Our room was spacious but not the cleanest - we found a pair of socks from a previous owner under the table and the bathroom was looking pretty shabby. Breakfast was included so don’t be conned by buying rooms with breakfast as extra. Unfortunately the breakfast wasn’t up to scratch and the staff were the rudest people around. In particular the chef who had something against anyone who asked for anything despite it being his job! The worst thing of the whole stay was coming back to find, what looked like an ecstasy tablet on my 6-yr olds bed. Luckily he didn’t put it in his mouth but this made us feel extremely uncomfortable and the attitude of the staff was, to say the least, bordering on disinterested despite our concerns. We asked for an investigation which they have refused and failed to answer emails and messages repeatedly. A warning to other travelers.",,,,,,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2019-10-29,"Dear Guest,

We always travel with the idea that our hotel room is a place to rest at the end of an action packed day and this hotel provided us with exactly that.  Very quiet at night which is perfect and the block out curtains mean we had a great sleep.  The pool is clean and super inviting after a long day of exploring.  Breakfast can get a little boring after a while, esp if you dont want EGGS again but its a small issue and didnt effect our stay at all.  We also managed to catch the comedy show which was a blast.

This hotel in Hollywood fit the bill perfectly, and I was very pleased with my choice.  

First, the rooms were spacious, very clean, and well-appointed.  My room opened into a lovely central courtyard. The hotel's location, on Vermont near the Greek Theatre, Sunset, and other hot spots, could not have been better. 

The staff at the hotel was very friendly and nice.  The gentlemen in the gift shop - an older man, I didn't catch his name - made my day with his friendliness and boundless knowledge of Hollywood and the things to do.  Parking is plentiful and very secure.  

Highly recommended!",Ask for a room connected to the courtyard.,,5.0,,5.0,,5.0,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-27,"Dear Guest,

Angelica checked me in fast and professionally. I got a 2nd floor queen room with a shared balcony. The room was small but lush and very comfortable. The bathroom was very nice and clean. 

WiFi was fast and reliable. The best part maybe was the free breakfast downstairs. Omlette and waffle station was amazing! I got up at 630 every morning to have the hearty breakfast. Best of any hotel I've stayed at.

tlagyn,599,"Franklin, Tennessee",2019-01-31,COUPLES,2019-01-20,3,Historic Route 66 Hotel - It's OK,"I picked this hotel specifically for its location near a niece and nephew we were visiting.  It is a nicely kept very retro hotel with historic appeal.  The staff are very nice and accommodating.  There is secured gated parking and There is a very safe feeling at the hotel.  The rooms are very small and poorly lighted.  The beds are extremely firm and pillows are small.  Breakfast included in a basement ""restaurant"" (think embassy suites - type breakfast but a bit more limited selection).  I ended up not using the TV as it spent most of the time in a ""no signal"" mode.  It is convenient to Hollywood and the studios etc.  Close to Children's Hospital.   Overall, a decent place with historic value, in need of some painting in halls and maybe an upgrade of furniture. Glad I experienced it but probably would not stay here again.  Plenty of higher quality hotels no too far away and about the same cost.  But if you like the historic value, worth the stay.",,,5.0,,4.0,3.0,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2019-01-22,"

Marka M,1,"Nashville, Tennessee",2018-12-31,COUPLES,2019-01-09,4,Great customer service!,"I booked this place through Hotwire.com. My wife and I was a little sketchy about the place prior to our trip after viewing the google maps satellite photos that pictured homeless individuals living in their tents on the side of the hotel on Vermont Place but we decided to risk it and kept our reservation and we are glad we did. The satellite photos I seen was out dated (Thank God) and the area is safe. When we arrived Pil at the front desk was very friendly, down to earth and delivered great customer service every time I seen him. One of the perks about this place is the free breakfast! It is not your average hotel free breakfast buffet. There were tons of selections to choice from. The chef Hugo was awesome and makes delicious omelettes EVERY TIME! The only thing I would say needs improve is the rooms need renovating or at least the room me and my wife stayed in. Dont get me wrong, the rooms are decent but I expected it to be little more modern. Other than that, we enjoyed our stay and would book this hotel again.

RandipC,15,"Reading, United Kingdom",2019-01-31,FAMILY,2019-01-06,2,Shows promise but management don’t care about customer service ,"This hotel put a dampener on our LA trip. I would NOT recommend it. 

There were some positives:
* The rooms were clean. 
* The room had a microwave and fridge. 
* The shower was hot and powerful. 
* There was ample parking
* It looked like lots of the hotel had been refurbished recently. 
* The omelette chef made a great omelette and was very cheerful/friendly in the morning. There were also 10 different cereals to choose from so it looked like there would a great breakfast. 

However, the customer service was poor. We had one significant issue and a several minor problems, all were dealt with a take it or leave it attitude. 

One day after being at a theme park all day we came back to find our room door open. The maid had not pulled the door shut so for the best part of the day anyone could have helped themselves to our belongings (passports, jewelry, etc). 

The management apologized but didn’t see the severity of the issue and tried to spin it into a positive. 

Other issues we had were: 
* It took over 30 mins to check in - not enough staff at the desk. 
* Room was very cold and the marble floor added to this issue. There was a small portable radiator but it took hours for it to have an effect on the room. The hotel couldn’t provide any slippers or any other solution. 
* Sound traveled easily - one night we were awoken by noisy guests returning to their rooms and on the final day we were awoken at 7.30 by construction noise
* Each day there were flies on the open bread and fruit in at breakfast buffet
* For 2 of our 4 day stay, the shampoo and conditioner were not replenished. Reception said they’d send more but this took nearly an hour. (This may sound trivial, but we all wanted to shower before bed and this meant we had less sleep; by the end of the trip we were very tired).  
* Pillows were very soft
* Lifts were slow and old. 

Also the surrounding neighborhood did not feel very safe. So we would only drive to nearby coffee shops etc. 

Overall the hotel shows some promise but the management have a “can’t be bothered attitude”, so I would suggest you stay clear.

H Winters,5,,2018-12-31,FAMILY,2018-12-12,5,Incredible service! Will recommend and stay again!!,"Our family has stayed at the Hollywood Hotel during both of our trips to LA. We thoroughly enjoy the service that the staff provides to each of its guests. Pil, the manager, is incredibly attentive and more than willing to go out of his way to help at any time. Hugo, the omelette guy, is always smiling and works as hard as anyone I’ve ever met. The rest of the staff are just as great as Pil and Hugo. Room was always clean, breakfast is great, and the location is perfect. You simply cannot beat the Hollywood Hotel for the price anytime or anywhere. Thank you!!

1NicePerson,318,"Alexandria, Virginia",2018-12-31,SOLO,2018-12-11,5,"Four and one half stars, rounded up to five","Don’t judge a book by its cover, nor by the photos on the website!  As you approach this hotel, it appears as grungy as the neighborhood, and I must have overlooked the rainbow fountain at the entrance.  A drab façade with faded and graffiti-touched signs is what greets you.  But inside the hotel is fresh and lovely.  If it were located just a few miles to the west, the price would be triple what I paid.   My room faced the courtyard and was quiet and comfortable.  The amenities were impressive, especially the toiletries in larger sizes than you find at 5 star hotels.  Breakfast was also very nice, served on real dishes and not paper plates.  Omelets and waffles were made to order and delicious.  
The wifi worked well once connected, but I had to reboot my laptop two or three times to get past the “connected, no internet” status which was rather frustrating.  And you are required to log in every time you reconnect, not once a day as in most hotels.  Also, unlike most hotels, check-in was surprisingly complicated and time-consuming.   Although I booked via the hotel’s own website and my receipt clearly showed my name, address, phone number, etc.,  the front desk agent handed me a paper and pen and asked me to write all that down again – not sure why.  She took a photocopy of my ID (which also showed my address) and then led me through a series of questions on an electronic display having to sign periodically that I won’t smoke, won’t overstay my reservation, won’t do this, that and the other thing.   At other hotels, you just present your ID and credit card and that’s it, unless you're applying for a job there.  And lastly, the building has four floors and over 100 rooms, but only one slow elevator.  So be prepared to wait.   
As for the location, I took Metro Green, Blue and Red lines from LAX to the hotel and do not recommend it due to the difficult connections and time-consuming crowded route.  A better way is to take the Green Line to Vermont/Athens station and then bus 754 to Vermont and Santa Monica or bus 204 to Vermont and Lexington (even closer).   I returned to the airport that way and it took 85 minutes.  
So, if you’re OK with East Hollywood and the other quirks mentioned above, this is a fine choice indeed.",,,4.0,,4.0,,5.0,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2018-12-21,"Dear Guest,

Mathieu V,43,"Paris, France",2018-11-30,BUSINESS,2018-12-01,2,Extremely disappointed !,"I've been really disappointed by the hotel. First of all, I paid a reservation through Booking.com and I had to pay the full price when I arrived at the hotel. So in the end, I paid the amount of the reservation in extra. But whatever. For this kind of prices, I was expecting a better room. You'll see in the photos attached, stains on the walls, ugly bathroom, stains on the bathroom's mirror, not a wonderful smell. The only good thing was the bed, which is good. But that's, I think, the minimum. Parking is expensive for an uncovered parking. I won't go to this hotel again.

Alyssa0546,5,"Austin, Texas",2018-11-30,FAMILY,2018-11-30,5,Everything we needed for a good deal.,"I was a little skeptical about the quality of the rooms after reading some of the reviews. I was able to get a good price on the rooms and knew there would be a steep parking fee, but the cost was outweighed by some of my other options. Plus, breakfast was complimentary and those same reviews said that the breakfast was the best part so I took the chance.
The hotel is VERY conveniently located to all the major attractions of Los Angeles and Hollywood. It's about a 30 min drive to Santa Monica and 45-60 mins to LAX depending on traffic. Great food, attractions, and shopping is all extremely close by, but not walking distance. The Metro is across the street with tons of bus stops in the area if you aren't renting a car. Lyft and Uber are also all over the place in the city and our highest trip was just $14.
Check-in was easy and we arrived early. The young lady at the front desk gave us a more  quiet room facing the parking lot and we had no noise disturbances. The rooms themselves had hardwood flooring and clean white sheets and towels. I've never felt a hotel bed that's super comfortable while also trying to stay within my budget, but we slept well and the beds were always made with towels consistently replaced. The bathroom was not upgraded like the main area, but the water pressure was incredible! Coming back home was a disappointment in comparison.
As predicted, fresh omelettes and waffles were prepared by chefs for free breakfast with lots of cereal and bread options to choose from. There was also fresh fruit, yogurt, juice and coffee every day.
Overall, this hotel was perfect for what a family of 3 needed to be comfortable, fed, and close to all of the things we wanted to do.",,,,,,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2018-11-30,"Dear Guest...

KateF,63,"New Brunswick, Canada",2018-11-30,COUPLES,2018-11-19,4,Hollywood Vacation,"I recently stayed at this hotel for four nights with my partner in November. Check in was easy and we had a room on the second floor with a small balcony facing the inside terrace/garden space. There were no chairs on the balcony so we didn't spend much time out there. This location is pretty good for Hollywood, it's a very short walk to catch the metro bus. We mostly used uber to get to Hollywood walk of fame or sunset Blvd. We did a tour of the hills and Hollywood which the company picked us up at the hotel, that was great. 

The rooms were smaller but clean and comfortable. Room was cleaned great every day, lots of cleaning staff. Quiet hotel, no noise at night. Continental breakfast was really good and it was great considering LA is so big to try and find a breakfast place.

The pool area is really nice, I found the Mosquitos really bad but no one else seemed to mind. Lots of towels and the chairs were super comfortable. The vista theatre is just up the street which was awesome as well.

This is a good hotel option if you want to stay in the middle of what LA has to offer. We took the metro to Santa Monica/Venice and it took about an hour, not bad. Also if you have a car the parking is good and gated. This is good quality for the money. ",,,,,,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2018-11-26,"Dear Guest,

New tiles and floors, shower stall, sink, furniture, everything new. The staff were really nice too. I got the free breakfast everyday--it was great to have available, but not spectacular. The only reason I give this place it a 4 star rating is because of the area. This is not a good area. I don't think you'd get mugged, but I wouldn't walk around by myself. There is a lot of homeless tents on the sidewalks and people spread out on street corners selling things. I had a car so I would just leave the area. I took a drive up Hollywood blvd and saw the sights. It wasn't far. I was there for a convention in the Convention Center. It was a 5 mile drive through some ""interesting"" areas. Overall the hotel is cute, and has security gates all around it, so I felt safe when I was there, it was just the area that was pretty sketchy.",,,,,,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2018-10-24,"Dear Guest...

Troy C,9,"Melbourne, Australia",2018-10-31,SOLO,2018-10-18,5,for the money and the staff it is not such a bad little hotel,"Not a bad hotel at all for the money and close to the train line at least. The owner is such an amazing German lady who is so dedicated to the business, that her and her sister start work everyday at the most awful hour you can imagine and you will not get her age right at all. The breakfast is fine and has enough range to have you fed and happy for the day.

Angelica, Nicole, Pil, the manager and the other 3 reception staff I saw less often, were all miracle workers and such a helpful and lovely team, well to put up with my constant blah blah and cheeky jokes, they are very good staff.

The breakfast staff were great and the omelette and waffle maker man was a great man for me to laugh with in the morning.............and yes they have land octopuses in Mexico, as he would be one of them. I had a crash course in speaking Spanish from and learning about Mexico, California's neighbor.

There were a few issues with housekeeping but I do not believe in whining about human issues that are easy to happen in such busy places and if you want to pay $10,000 a night go for it but realistic pay packets prevent such deluded ideals and even in those places things can still go wrong there too and when I am disabled and have stuff all over the room, I can see why, however I still believe that many people that stay at hotels can whine about garbage that is not that much of an issue.

I did an um and an aah over very good or excellent, however I decided on excellent as there are mostly good things and very minor things that I am not too sure are bad or not, so excellent it is Angelica, the beautiful natured senorita, OK Nicole you too and Pil........sorry not beautiful for me, but a man with staying power and sense of humor due to my blabber mouth.

They helped me immensely with advise and without this front house team and their good management, I would have had trouble in LA.

The best of LA was this hotel and that is sad, as LA has to lift its game, as the city needs a major clean up that they can afford but will not do so.

I do not like America much as they have far too many issues in all sectors but this hotel seems to leave those outside as much as possible, which is great.Sure others may have had things go wrong that I did not know about, but I was there for 10 nights and not too much bothered me, so mathematically it is a hotel with not too many issues.

I hope this reaches the staff, managers and owners and I hope they look me up when they come to Melbourne, so I can tell what is the best, as my blabber mouth and energy knows where and what is good and bad.",,,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2018-10-22,"Dear Guest

Obviously there is a refurbishment going on. The young men on the desk were so friendly and gave us great ideas for eating out. Our room was spacious and quiet. We loved the free entertainment in the bar each night- our first experience of stand up comedy and was the highlight of our stay there. Breakfasts could have been better, few staff, and they ran out of things like green tea and tables were not cleared very promptly. So need to get the restaurant up to scratch. Bar snacks would be good too. The pool needs some extras like snacks and bar service. Price was good for our stay there and we would stay there again!

A J,10,"Copenhagen, Denmark",2018-08-31,FRIENDS,2018-10-14,1,"Terrible quality, very dirty and full of ants","The list of pros about this hotel is short: great location and fantastic breakfast.

As for the cons; The entire property is severely worn down, with dirty carpets, cracks in the ceilings and peeling wallpaper. When we first came into the room, we noticed how worn down it was, but half the outlets also did not work, so we had to go down to the reception who then fixed it. Not long after, we noticed that there were ants crawling EVERYWHERE. In the beds even!  When we complained we were told that an employee would come up and spray the room, but since we felt it was simply just too disgusting to stay in, we were moved to a new room, that only had a couple of visible ants.

The entire time we were dealing with getting a new room, the employee of the hotel was extremely condescending and asking if we ""didn't have ants where we came from"". Insulting and borderline racist. Generally ants do not show up repeatedly unless you have a problem that you are not addressing. In this hotel's case, my money is on their very low standard of cleanliness and the poor upkeep of the rooms.

The new room was bigger, but was just as worn down. The employee sprayed the room down and promised us there would be no ants, but within 4 days they were crawling on the walls there as well. I shudder to think how many ants crawled around in our luggage and came home with us.

Additionally, the housekeeping will not respect if you don't want them to come into the room - they will enter anyway - even if the sign is up and they do not keep their hands to themselves. We had several items thrown out which was not in the trash or meant to be thrown out.

In the aftermath, we tried to get some form of compensation from Hollywood Hotel and the third party site we booked through, but both parties have been utterly unhelpful and unresponsive.

We had hoped that this would be our go-to hotel in Los Angeles, but this was most certainly our last stay. This hotel is vastly overpriced considering the condition of the rooms, but I would rather spend more and then be guaranteed some standard of cleanliness and a pest free stay.",,,1.0,1.0,,1.0,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2018-10-19,"Dear Guest...

Liam,3,"Cairns, Australia",2018-09-30,COUPLES,2018-09-26,3,A little rough but otherwise good experience.,"Accommodation was average. It is a room with a bed, bathroom, small fridge, cable TV and not a lot else. Though upon closer inspection, the tiles in the bathroom were chipped and some completely broken.

There is a nice outdoor area that claims to have a bar open...but it never was...and ""opening times and dates are subject to change"". The Route 66 bar downstairs was pretty good. 

The area the hotel is in is close enough to Hollywood but far enough that you wont want to walk it. There are some close fast food outlets nearby but nothing amazing.

The ""fitness centre"" is a small room that if it had more than 1 person would feel crowded.

The complimentary buffet breakfast was really good. The chef made the best omelets! The staff were really helpful. Good experience, but pretty average hotel.",,,,,,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2018-09-30,"Dear Guest,

Sophie,45,"London, United Kingdom",2018-08-31,FRIENDS,2018-08-27,3,Rough around the edges - you get what you pay for,"I was a bit concerned about this hotel as I'd read some poor reviews, particularly as we'd booked a cheap room through a third party booking site. My concerns were well placed - you get what you pay for.
Positives - the hotel is in a bit of a middle-of-nowhere area but is well-located for many of the main tourist attractions in north-central LA. It'll only take you 15 minutes in a car or taxi to Griffith Park or Downtown, 20 minutes to dead central Hollywood. The communal areas of the hotel are also good: the pool area is clean and attractive, as are the outside frontage, reception, courtyard, bar, breakfast area and corridors. Their prices are good for the area the hotel is in. Service was good during our stay - even if it was obvious that housekeeping only turned the bedsheets, rather than replacing them (I discovered this when a piece of tape accidentally left on the bed magically turned up inside it the next day!)

The rooms are in the process of renovation. If you book their cheapest rooms, prepare to get their cheapest rooms. Some of the rooms seem to not have been updated for five or ten years, and are very worn and rough. Our Two Queens room on the second floor was clean and mercifully ant-free (see previous poor reviews.) However, a three-star hotel room it was not. The room was dark and gloomy. The fridge did not work. The air conditioning was weak, paintwork was chipped and wallpaper was peeling throughout. The drain in the shower was loose, the shower head was falling out of the wall, and the floor was slippery. The electrical plug sockets were an obvious health hazard: you couldn't even plug things into some of them without the plug falling out, and with others, the contacts hung at a precarious angle. I'm very glad I didn't travel with curious children, as it would have been very easy to get a shock from these.
I have stayed in plenty of three star hotels that have been basic, but fresh and functional. This hotel room was basic, but neither fresh nor functional, and desperately in need of an update.
I suppose it's our fault for booking the cheapest possible rate, as we are a pair of young travellers on a budget. However, we did include a message with our booking saying it was for a special occasion, hoping that we might at least get a recently renovated room - particularly as we were returning customers. We did not. 

Having looked at other reviews, I would advise that if you stay at this hotel, you should book at one of their higher rates, through their website directly, and do not go for the cheapest you can find. If you book the cheapest, you will get the worst they have.","Ask for a room on upper floors, you will be less likely to have pests.",3.0,3.0,,,,3.0,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2018-09-03,"Dear Guest,

tanya10,43,,2018-08-31,FAMILY,2018-08-15,4,Lovely hotel,"Built around 1903 this lovely hotel is an unusual combination of old and new. Rooms were clean and our room was large enough for 2 queen beds and a rollaway. The beds were comfy. They have a nice pool area.

There was a complimentary buffet breakfast served downstairs that had plenty of choices including chef-cooked omelets and waffles. Towards the end of the serving times sometimes the staff dont always keep the pastry trays full but serving times are pretty generous so most people are done anyway. Typical American coffee is available (awful) but that's not the fault of the hotel- seems it's the standard in the US

On the negative side, the bathroom was very small. And the rollaway bed was relatively expensive ($40 pn) compared to other places we've stayed. You have to pay for parking if you have a car.

The location of the hotel also has its pros and cons. Very easily accessible to the Metro stations of Vermont/Santa Monica or Vermont/Sunset means you are only 2 or 3 quick stops away from the centre of Hollywood and all that has to offer or downtown LA in the other direction. Alternatively, it's also on several bus routes. Travel on their transport system is fairly cheap and easy but limited to the major centres. Plenty of Uber and Lyft options - taxis are a rip-off. 

The downside: not a super fantastic area and not much to actually do locally (apart from a couple of not so fantastic restaurants) so no point in going out to just look around nearby. Lots of homeless people everywhere you go and no different here but I never felt unsafe.

The staff we dealt with, Nicole and Pil were lovely. We paid for late check out ($50 till max 2pm) but the hotel will also store your luggage for free after check out if you need it. After our late check out they allowed us to use the pool area until we needed to leave for the airport. On a hot summer day with not enough time to do much but too much time to do nothing, this was incredibly helpful.

They also have a cute bar and host comedy nights regularly, which we unfortunately did not have an opportunity to attend but would have liked. 

I would recommend the hotel and stay again",,,,,,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2018-09-24,"Dear Guest,

AlexiaDahl,23,"Copenhagen, Denmark",2018-08-31,FRIENDS,2018-08-14,1,"Ants everywhere, dirty and very poor quality of the rooms","CONS:
The rooms are not clean or maintained - some rooms are newly renovated, but I have stayed here twice and always end up in the worn down ones. So keep this in mind when reading reviews. The rooms are very poorly lit, the ceiling has cracks, the wallpaper is falling off and the floor is dirty. The carpets in the hallway have a lot of stains and it is in general not that nice. The housekeeping will not respect if you don't want them to come into the room - they will enter anyway - even if the sign is up and they do not keep their hands to themselves. I had several items thrown out which was not in the trash or meant to be thrown out. Also, the hotel has a lot of ants inside the room, when we complained we were told that an employee would come up and spray the room but as we looked further we could see that the ants were in EVERY nook and cranny on the tables and in the bed. We were so frustrated that the hotel would only spray the room that we managed to get a new room instead. This room had the same condition as the old one, but only one ant was visible. The employee threw us quite an attitude but sprayed the room down and promised us there would be no ants but within 4 days they were crawling on the walls there as well.

PLUSSES:
The location, which is quite nice and close to the red line Metro plus several busses. The neighbourhood is friendly and I at least felt safer there compared to Downtown. I have stayed here twice. The breakfast is really good, and the main reason we came back to the hotel.","Ask for a newly renovated rooms, since the others are totally worn down",,1.0,,1.0,,1.0,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2018-09-03,"Dear Guest...

William B,79,"Mansfield, United Kingdom",2018-08-31,COUPLES,2018-08-05,4,Perfect with a little TLC,"Booked a 5 night stay as we wanted to be somewhere close to LA. Found this for $850 dollars for 5 nights.

Positives
- Great location. Metro 2 minutes away which will take you most places.
- Good choice of food etc around. Wendy's, Pizza Hut etc all within a 5 minute walk.
- Room was huge. Checked in room 136 (suite) has a giant hot tub, lounge, bar area.
- Breakfast, Hugo is great making us waffles and eggs in the morning. Good choice of bread, pastries, couple of hot items, fruit etc. Perfect way to start my day and often skipped lunch due to still feeling full.
- It is a very nice looking hotel, the steps in the back are really nice and great for photos.

Negatives
- The air conditioning. Set to the lowest temperature and it is pretty useless, they even provide 2 tower fans in the room so must be aware. I do expect a 4 star hotel in a city that is always hot to have decent ac. Had a couple of restless nights due to the heat.
- Parking, quite a few reviews have commented on the parking cost. It is expensive however very secure.
- Finishings. What I mean by this is that whilst it is nice a few of the fixtures and fittings are a little tatty. Plug sockets worked but if you touched the plug would stop working. Silicone around the bath etc missing and grubby, chipped tiles. Whilst none of these are big issues they wouldn't take too much to fix and get the place looking great again.
- Area. The outside area is a strange one, sometimes I felt really safe, others not so much. Directly opposite the hotel one evening people were giving the homeless food, not saying they shouldn't eat but was a little intimidating. Often on the way to the Metro would walk past a couple of homeless people. Again it is a big city and I know it happens, I am not saying the hotel can do anything about this but could make some people feel uncomfortable.
- Final criticism is the middle courtyard. On the website it is made to look constantly open and a central part to the hotel. Not once whilst I was there did it open. In fact the bar area itself is empty so looks like it isn't used. A real shame as all the photos made it look like it would be open and a nice place to relax at the end of the day. Sadly not. 

All in all a great stay, a little TLC and it could be an amazing stay. That being said I would recommend it and would stay again. ",,,,,,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2018-09-24,"Dear Guest

Marlowe34,35,"Sutton, United Kingdom",2018-08-31,COUPLES,2018-08-03,4,Horary for Hollywood (Hotel) ,"Perfectly placed and aesthetically pleasing, the Hollywood Hotel promises a lot at a good price. Nonetheless, on arrival I was disappointed by a set up that seemed to challenge such high expectations. The lobby was full with, what I assumed to be, a tour party and they were being checked in. As a veteran of checking in large groups with numerous school trips I know how this can be effectively managed but could see no real structure to what was going on or any sense of when my turn would come: I admit, it cast a cloud over my feelings for the place.

However, I am happy to say that it rapidly dissipated during our four nights' stay here. Once we were checked in I was delighted to see we had a spacious room that was clean and tidy with a comfortable bed and plenty of light . We did come across a small number of sneaky ants coming into the bathrom and we ended up getting Raid to deal with them ourselves, but their presence was minimal and once we took action they did not return. I know reading about insects in hotels can set alarm bells ringing but this was really nothing and the attentive service, lovely room and absolutely superb positioning made up for it two times over. The breakfast was also pretty special with a lovely selection of fruits, meats, cheese and pastry and omelettes and waffles, freshly made before your eyes, that were to die for.

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in the hotel, I even now wish I had given the very inviting swimming pool a go, and feel pretty certain that the slightly jarring experiences we had were one offs. Suffice to say when next we come across to The West Coast from old Blighty, the Hollywood Hotel would be top on the list of places to stay. Thanks.

revo2001,6,"Valley Stream, New York",2018-07-31,FAMILY,2018-07-26,2,ANTS!,"Stayed in room 112, noticed right away that the bathroom needed some work. Attempted unsuccessfully to cancel our reservation. A closer inspection revealed very small ANTS in the bathroom! Because the lights in the bathroom were bright you could easily see them, that was not the case in the rest of the room. I have no idea if they were anywhere else. The bathroom was in need of repair. The bottom of the door was rotting, tiling, grouting and caulking needed to be done. Even the TV connection was poor.  We stayed the night and requested a room change in the morning. The staff was very accommodating, and didn't charge us for parking for our 2 nights. The next room, 123, looked much better. The TV worked properly, the bathroom looked better. Unfortunately, if you spent any time in the bathroom you again encountered ANTS! Very small ants like in the other room. At checkout we brought it up again, no compensation was given. The staff acted surprised but there was no way that they were not aware of the situation. This hotel was not cheap, I expected more. They never asked for me to point out the problem so I expect that the rooms were just given to other unsuspecting guests without addressing the issues.",,,,,,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2018-07-27,"Dear Guest, 

Sorry to hear the issue you experienced while staying with us. The situation was unfortunate and isolated. Some of the issues are not in our control.  We find ants in Los Angeles all spring and summer long, due to the rise of temperature. However, we would like to ensure you that we are working with an outside pest company to take care of this issue.

Tina Y,9,"Sunnyvale, California",2018-07-31,FAMILY,2018-07-20,1,Dump,"Now this is the second time I have stayed at this hotel. The first time was 3 1/2 years ago, and we had a great time. Rates were less than a $100, and they gave us huge renovated clean rooms.

This time, we paid almost 3 times what we paid last time, and our family of 4 got a small recently renovated room on the ground floor overlooking the parking lot. My Indian parents got a smaller, older room, with an incredibly tiny non-renovated bathroom for the same price. We had two mosquitoes in our room, and I spent 30 mins trying to kill them, with thoughts of Zika and West Nile viruses in my head. Next day, I complained at the Front desk, and they said they would send someone to spray something and get rid of the mosquitoes, but non-one came, and we still had them in our room the second night. The pool was filthy, and filled with dead wasps and debris. And when we checked out, my 85-year old Dad told me that they charged him $54 dollars for pay-per-view. According to the hotel, my Indian Dad who has never heard of Marvel, watched ""Avengers: Infinity War""  when we were out at night having dinner. Showing the Front Desk our dinner receipt didn't help, as they did not even want to look at it. And apparently, the next morning, at 7 am , he watched the same movie for 19 mins and was charged $21.99 for it. Despite my Father's denial that he watched any such movie, the Manager would not budge. We were celebrating my Dad's 85th birthday, and this totally ruined our experience. Whatever happened, the hotel could have been gracious and removed the charges, but apparently we were not important enough. When I complained about the mosquitoes, the Manager said that they were just part of the local wildlife. I didn't know LA is part of a jungle environment.  Maybe the fact that we were Indian contributed to our shoddy treatment. We are never going to stay at this hotel again. A lot more hotels to be found at the exorbitant prices we paid. 

To be fair, the Breakfast Buffet is excellent, and was the highlight of our stay.",Don&#39;t get the ground floor rooms. These seem to have a pest issue.,1.0,1.0,,4.0,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2018-07-27,"Dear Tina,

The reviews are great! The images are jaw dropping and the price was good & affordable! So I proceeded to booking thinking this was going to be an average hotel experience. 

Wow was I wrong!

Once I stepped foot into the lobby I was greeted in the most welcoming way ever! Pil who works at the front desk was amazing throughout the whole process, in both guiding and explaining the terms and policies. Everything was super clear, and he answered every question with confidence and a charming smile(:

We then proceeded to our room which happened to be one of the newest,renovated and improved rooms... I kid you not when i tell you that i was SPEECHLESS.! This was all too good to be true. I was able to give my girlfriend the most amazing trip for her birthday! An extraordinary room for an incredible price! I felt like it was my birthday! Hahaha,

Anyways I will definitely be coming back for my next trip! Or even just keep making trip arrangements to stay at Hollywood Hotel(:

JKrm63,19,"Scottsdale, Arizona",2018-07-31,COUPLES,2018-07-12,4,Nice but noisey,The room was nicely decorated and comfortable.  But it was on the ground floor with the patio glass doors right on the busy street including a bus stop.  I had trouble sleeping due to the noise which wasn't a great start since we'd just driven seven hours from Phoenix.  The free breakfast was really great with made-to-order omelets/eggs and waffles.

travellerA3060RW,1,"Melbourne, Australia",2018-07-31,FRIENDS,2018-07-10,1,Don't ruin your holiday!,"We booked this hotel from booking.com months prior. When the day finally came for us to check-in, we were greeted by the rudest man at the counter. Not only did he try to charge us $800 more than what we reserved from booking.com. Our frustration only grew when we were forced to call booking.com to have them speak to the rude man to allow us to stay at the hotel for the inital quoted price (we arrived at the hotel after a long flight at 12am and it was not 1.30pm).

We had so many issues with the hotel which forced us to take it up with the manager Giselle who agreed to compensate us $50 for the trouble caused who then blackmailed us and wanted us to leave the hotel and find another place to stay at mid holiday. 

Not worth the hassle. This was a hotel I was looking forward to go to byt the experience just left us feeling stressed and upset. If you do have to make a stay here, make sure you speak with a staff member called Pele. He was an absolute help throughout and showed such good customer service.",,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2018-10-18,"Dear Guest...

DNCanadaVN,53,,2018-05-31,COUPLES,2018-06-01,5,Excellent Historic Hotel in Hollywoof,"We were in this beautiful hotel during 6 days before going to Australia, NZ and Fiji. Initially we were little scare about the vicinity but after one day to visit the area, we're ensure and found the area very safe, despite some unfortunate homeless people walking around.

Concerning the hotel, it is old but very well maintained and still kept its old day charm. The breakfast in the morning is fabulous and the coffee is excellent, plenty of fruit and anything that you will need to start your day. The recessed swimmimg pool is awful, very quiet for full relaxation after a day of visiting Hollywood and its vicinity.

The staff is very helpful, available and friendly. They are always ready to answer your question and offer you any help.

Very important to mention that the hotel is next to the Vermont-S. Monica Subway Station on the Red Line and you can be in DownTown Hollywood in 10 min. at USD 1.75. In our case, it costs us only .35cent (senior off hour). We also experienced to go to LAX airport in using Subway (Red, Blue and Green Line), still at .35 cent fare and got to LAX as a brise. It costed us USD 105.00 for a taxi when we arrived at midnight at the beginning of our trip.

We are overwhelmed and very happy at Hollywood Hotel, one of the best in Small Historic Category and won't hesitate a second to repeat this experience.

First of all I have traveled all over the world and I have over seven years of experience in hospitality. In all of these experiences I have never ever once had my personal ID scanned and printed for the hotel to keep. When I questioned as to why they took photocopies of IDs. I did not get a straight answer the front office agent, who replied “all hotels in LA do this. “ well first of all this is untrue. I work in a five star hotel in California and have stayed in Multiple hotels in LA and not one of them have ever scanned and copied my ID. This is something you should stop immediately. What are you doing with our personal information once we check out? Why are you keeping a piece of paper of guests IDs when ANY employee has access to this information... I understand having to show your ID but taking a copy is unethical. When a guest is concerned and refusing you to make a copy of this card. They have the right to do so. You cannot deny access to a hotel room until you take a photo copy of their personal ID. VERY BAD business practice. In addition to this issue, the hotel you can tell is currently under going construction and I can definitely see the potential for this hotel however, you sure have photoshopped ALL of your photos to the point it is an unrealistic representation of your property. Our bathroom tiles were cracked and bathroom dirty. The beds extremely comfortable and the pillows must have cost the hotel a $1 a piece. Worst nights sleep. For the cost the hotel it isn’t a horrible property. Like I said they have potential. However, I would never stay again and will continue to discourage ALL patrons to stay away until they change their privacy policy. ",,,,,,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2018-05-16,"Dear Guest

Towel rack comes right off the wall & if you're not careful, it'll hit your foot.

The hotel was really nice and the King Suite was huge with a spa bath, bar area and living room area with sofas, tables, chairs, etc. We also had two TVs and 3 phones. We had the downstairs King Suite which seemed dark all the time but there were plenty of lamps/lights to compensate. The reception staff were friendly and helpful and the breakfast was really good, as was the housekeeping, our room was spotless.
I would have given the hotel 4.5 stars if I could. The only reason I wouldn't was that the bar was not open at all on the Monday and Tuesday we were there and there is not a lot immediately around the hotel. One other point (not the hotel's fault) is that it appears to be in bit of a run down area. We were a bit conscious of this the first couple of days we arrived and using the underground train down the road but we were not bothered by anyone. The underground train down the road is really easy to use and to get around on.

In terms of amenities, I had stayed at the Sofitel immediately prior to checking in here so the disparity in class between the two establishments was rather noticeable. Having said that, the service here was as great. I was a little concerned about the number of junkies and homeless lounging in the immediate vicinity of the hotel in particular and this section of Vermont Ave in general.

Upon arrival on Nth Vermont Ave we were searching for the Hotel in the picture, turns out the photo shown is actually at the back of the hotel.  Spacious room, comfy bed, very tidy, limited utensils in the kitchen.  No seats on the balcony but a view looking up to Griffith Observatory.  Amazing buffet breakfast and friendly staff.  The pool area is great and they supply fresh towels.  There are lots of lounge chairs in the pool area.  The hotel is located close to the Metro which was a big pro but aside from that the area has a dodgy feel and isn't close to much else.

Bed had a very comfortable firmness and the room was quiet.  The shower had plenty of water pressure; it was a shower only, no tub.  It appeared that every room had a balcony or a patio.  The central courtyard is very pretty, an enjoyable place to hang out - my room's patio opened onto the interior courtyard.  There is a small but adequate exercise room.  The included breakfast was supported by two chefs to prepare individual egg dishes, plus a wide variety of fruit and bread items.

Cherie W,2,,2018-04-30,COUPLES,2018-04-18,1,Bad Front desk and housekeeping,"My husband and I were staying for our anniversary I work at the inn at the cove and I am a manger ,also my husband is law enforcement, so I know how hotels run .When I checked in the front desk lady was nice and everything was nice. I checked into the room and it had been recently remolded. The hotel itself was very nice, the beds are a little to hard and the street noise keep me up all night. That is fine because I know that is not the hotels fault. After checking out we went to universal studios and we received a phone call from the front desk manger explaining that there were two robes missing from the  room and that they were charging our card. When we checked in there were no robes in the room, I was not  even aware that they had robes. When I tried to explain this to the front desk manger she just kept repeating herself and being very dismissive, not even listing. She  said housekeeping keeps a log of the robes, which is a good idea if this was being done properly, and she informed us that she is charging our card for the missing robes Housekeeping dropped the ball on this and I feel very violated of my integrity and my money. There mistake is costing me 189 dollars which I think is very wrong and bad customer service. I don't think anybody would be this upset if they had actually stole the robes'! I should be reimbursed and get an apology. I don't want to put the hotel down for the bad employees ,but if this is the way you want to run your business then I would be very cautious of what is in your room before you check in so you want be charged .",,,1.0,,2.0,,4.0,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2018-10-18,"Dear Guest...

Location is also pretty good for driving to various places. Seems safe to walk around. Covell and Good Luck are couple great bars about 15min walk north.

And about 50yards south, a large shopping complex with plenty of space. Pay a few dollars or do the lot if around in the day, then overnight on the street (always space).

Stephanie I,127,"Santa Monica, California",2018-02-28,COUPLES,2018-04-04,5,A Great Stay at the Hollywood Hotel!,"The newly remolded room we stayed in, felt like classic old Hollywood boasting white, yellow, grey and black color combinations and decor with a modern, retro twist. Overlooking the open air fountain courtyard from the balcony was the perfect way to start the day with that famous California sunshine light beaming in. Mornings were spent with a hot cup of coffee in hand, wrapped in a plush white robe, planning our day of Hollywood activities.

The Hollywood Hotel is one of the most reasonably priced accommodations I have come across in the city of stars that offers incredible value in a great central location with plenty of public transit options surrounding it. It’s the closest hotel to the Hollywood Sign, Mount Hollywood hiking trails, Griffith Park, Greek Theater, and Los Angeles Zoo, while also being located just steps away from renowned LA shopping and dining, the Hollywood Walk of Fame and Chinese Theater. Griffith Park Observatory was one of my favorite parts of Hollywood and was a magnificent view of the Downtown LA skyline with the sunrise peaking over. We got to be in Stephen Spielberg’s and Michael Jackson’s shoes in a mere matter of minutes from the hotel, I mean, talk about a productive morning! The Hollywood walk of Fame and Chinese Theater were quite a sight filled with lots of energy, colorful characters, visitors and stars. The Hollywood Sign was on my must visit list this trip. The hike up to it was a great way to get in some exercise in the amazing California weather while visiting an iconic Hollywood sight!

After a day of exploring, the Hollywood Hotel was a wonderful place to return to to relax, catch a swim and relax by the retro outdoor pool, pop into the on-site fitness center, lounge and sip cocktails in the fountain courtyard with other guests and even attend a show at the hotel’s very own comedy club, which brings all-star comedians from all over to the property on a weekly basis.

Overall, such a wonderful way to spend some time in Hollywood, California before our trip across the world. What once was an area I overlooked, has quickly become one of my favorite areas of Los Angeles and the Hollywood Hotel has become my favorite Hotel in Hollywood.",Stay in a remodeled room with a private balcony,,5.0,,5.0,,5.0,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2018-04-06,"Dear Guest,

Check in and parking were easy enough, and the view from our room was the Hollywood sign! It's super close (about a block) from the LA metro line which took us to Hollywood and Vine and Universal Studios. Parking was safe and secure. The breakfast was legendary and we enjoyed the build your own omelette and fresh fruit. The showers were super refreshing and we even asked for more of the complimentary soap and shampoo ""ROAM"" because it smelled so good. We checked out the Route 66 bar for happy hour and found out we could even get drinks delivered to the pool. The housekeeping staff was extremely punctual and thorough and the upstairs outdoor patio had great views of downtown LA.

Tracy P,1,,2018-03-31,COUPLES,2018-03-29,1,"Stay Away - Incompetent, Uncaring, Thieves","My husband and I stayed at the hotel, and on returning to the hotel for the night, while getting ready for bed, we discovered that my retainer was not in the bathroom where I left it - in a cup soaking, as I had done every night of our stay.  It’s worth at least $250; who knows what it costs in California to replace. It’s not easily replaced. We just moved here. I don’t have an orthodontist here. Bobby was rude. Martin? couldn’t be bothered. Both refused to do anything claiming we had to talk to the daytime manager - I needed my medical appliance that night. The longer we waited, the more likely it would be unable to find. They claimed there was no night manager. I asked who they would call if they had a problem; apparently no one, which makes this an unsafe hotel. No one is in charge. 

To top it off, no cups replaced the ones that were taken. No soap was replaced. 

What in the world was their staff thinking? They wouldn’t even let me make a claim. Bobby, who wouldn’t make eye contact or talk to me, laughed at me and told me from across the room to file a claim with my insurance company? What insurance company - it’s their damn hotel. I don’t insure against their negligence.  

I stay in hotels regularly, never once has any staff touched my retainer or anything that I was using, like a cup. 

I’m so angry and it’s going to cause me serious problems that will out value $250. What’s the cost of new braces to put my teeth back in place? The headaches caused by grinding my teeth? A broken tooth that the retainer protected against? The embarrassment of that? Lost time at my new job. 

Do not come here.  Tons of hotels in L.A.  These people will create problems and then not care.

Daniel O,2,"Manchester, United Kingdom",2017-07-31,FRIENDS,2018-03-08,1,Very unsafe location,"The only positive I can describe about this hotel is the beds that were very big and comfy. 

Cons: 

- The area is awful, rough, scary, whatever you want to call it, very unsafe. When we checked in a junkie from the street made their way into the lobby screaming which was very unsettling.
- The receptionist Gisele had a bad attitude, bearing in mind we're British tourists who had never been to America/LA and simply asked if the Subway was safe to use she went on the defence immediately for some reason and was also very snappy and unhelpful about explaining the deposit. There seems to be a lot of bad reviews about her particularly on here, lose the attitude, it doesn't look good.
- Beautiful view from our room of a 'family clinic'...
- Small pool which is next to the car park and all you can hear is the LA traffic.
- Nothing to do in the area, if you want snacks you have to go to the gas station which is as far as we would walk in this area.
- There is public transport in this area but wouldn't recommend taking it is as its unsafe.
- The hotel is far from actual Hollywood and West Hollywood which is a much nicer area, I would recommend paying extra to stay in WeHo/sunset strip or even santa monica area, anywhere would be better than here
- Breakfast was mediocre, yes there was a chef who made omelettes but 90% of the food was buffet style and not great.

I really do hope I've made someone make a better informed decision on where to stay in LA because this hotel/staff/area ruined our time in LA, such a shame. We were counting down the minutes to our flight out of there.",,,1.0,3.0,,3.0,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2018-03-09,"Dear Guest,

Thank you very much for staying with us and also taking the time to correspond with me about your experience previously. Obviously very concerned about your comments. Our hotel does have an aggressive pest prevention process and we do take your incident seriously. Fortunately, our pest control contractor found no activity in the room you were originally assigned to.

This hotel is easy access to Universal Studio, Beverly Hills, Lake Hollywood Park for Hollywood sign viewing, Santa Monica etc. Tips for those who are not driving - take the uber share ride to the attractions is another affordable options to travel around LA. 

The room is clean and spacious for two. Coffee maker with Starbuck coffee and tea bags are provided for quick refreshment in the room. 

I’ve this room booked at $90+ include breakfast. The breakfast is yummy to fill up the hungry stomach in the morning. I like most the egg and waffle station! The egg station cook - Hugo is friendly and efficient too!

rhodeygem,323,,2017-07-31,SOLO,2018-01-28,2,"Yuck, not a comfy place","I was going to stay for a few nights, but checked out after the first one.
First of all... Hollywood is NOT a beautiful part of LA.  There is a ton of crime, and most of the areas around the tourist attractions are filled with drug addicts, homeless people and hoodlums. The ""attractions"" are absolute rip offs.
I didn't come for that, was just hoping to have a nice place to stay while visiting family in the area. 

On check in, you are asked to approve a deposit to cover ""incidentals"".  The pool is located out the back door and across the parking lot. There are some lounge chair there, but it is not really the relaxing place they make it appear to be. 
The room was grimey, as were the hallways.  The breakfast, despite some reviews, was very average, and the omelette chef did not act friendly at all.   The eggs in my omelette were not even cooked, there was pale yellow runny stuff all over my plate.  I didn't eat it.

Hotels are so expensive in LA, but if you're going to have to pay, I'd recommend go downtown, and stay at one of the chain hotels.

Cons:

Price is pretty steep compared to its 3-4 star hotel peers.
The shower was too tight. 
Extra pressure needed to a start the shower.

This hotel have lots of potential to be a 4-star hotel.

We literally used the hotel to sleep for 5 hours. Since we were checking out very early and not going to be at the hotel for the complimentary breakfast, our only request was for 3 extra regular (as opposed to decaf) coffee packets for the room. On our way out, NYE, we asked at the front desk if they would bring them up to the room while we were out. He said you could grab them now. He then  said he only had 2, sorry.

John Gio P,1,,2017-12-31,BUSINESS,2018-01-04,1,WARNING! DO NOT BOOK THIS HOTEL!!! :(,"I will put this as one of the worst hotel stays in my lifetime. This dump is literally a small notch above a hotel/motel located in a third world country.

Let's start off with the misleading booking of the room. Not at any point in my conversation with the agent was it disclosed that there was an additional $26.00 charge for parking in there lot. I was not happy about this. I get into the room and the A/C is on full blast in the month of December with the temp being in the 50's. I called the front desk staff and asked them how to adjust the temp, was told they would send someone right up, no one ever showed up. Avoid any room facing the main road as you will hear ambulances and street traffic the entire night. Finally wake up to hopefully enjoy a nice hot shower. Towels provided were thinned out and overused ready to be retired as rags. Hot water temp was maybe at best a luke warm with an outdated shower and limestone clogged shower head. Since I was already freezing from the room being in the 50's this was not pleasant. 

The real downer and what will put the the nail in the coffin was checking out in the morning when I went to go check out. I explained to the woman at the counter the issues I faced and asked why no one showed up after my call to the front desk. Her only response was ""I don't know"" with a smirk on her face. 

WARNING! Spend your money $ elsewhere and avoid The Hollywood Hotel! This place is outdated, horrible uncomfortable rooms and just a complete waste of money.",,2.0,1.0,,,1.0,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2018-01-12,"Dear Guest...

First the hotel: It is nicely maintained. The rooms, while not overly large (and there's no closet) more than met our needs.  The hotel was quiet and there was a full breakfast complete with omelette station included with the room due, and the dining area is really nice. 

But, be prepared, the area around the hotel, while not bad, is also not particularly glamorous. That great photo of the 'entrance' is not the street view of the hotel, but from the Parking Lot (or course, once you check in, you do enter via the parking lot. 

We were taking in a show at the Pantages, and this was a convenient stay.  I guess, that's the key here, it's a great place to stay,  you will be driving to the areas you actually want to visit. (I guess that's LA).  Would I stay there again? Yes

Mishky1,188,"Melbourne, Australia",2017-10-31,FAMILY,2017-12-22,2,Mediocre.,"We expected better quality at the Hollywood Hotel, judging by the photos.  Instead, it was fairly mediocre across the board.  On the positive, the breakfast was pretty good, with a chef making waffles, pancakes, omelettes etc. The pool area was small, a bit out of the way, but ‘ok’ for our needs. The room was quiet and clean, but the housekeeping was appalling.  Early one morning, we were badgered by the cleaning lady to get out of our room because she was waiting to clean it.  We were on our way out for the day anyway, so wasn’t too disturbed by it.  But then the second day we came back to the room late at night to find it hadn’t been cleaned or made up at all.  Our son’s bed had no sheets on it and dirty towels were still piled up in the bathroom.  To try and get someone to come and make up all the beds and change the towels seemed like a monumental task. Only when my husband dumped all the towels down in the lobby did they send somebody up to attend to the issue.  When you’ve been out all day, the last thing you want to come back to, as a guest, is an unmade bed and dirty towels.  And last time I checked, besides a bed to sleep in, daily service is what you pay a hotel for?
And lastly, the area where the hotel is located seems pretty dodgy.....we weren’t comfortable walking around the area at all and it’s not family friendly.  Quite a few homeless people/ beggars on the sidewalks. Also, it’s a bit of a drive in traffic to the actual ‘Hollywood’ tourist area and is a short drive to Universal Studios.

Her attitude was very bad. I cant believe this exists in a hospitality industry. Also, we hadn't even checked in.

Pluses - most of the cruddy old carpet has been ripped out and replaced by laminated board flooring, doors are heavy and have card security, good to have a safe in room. Pool area is quite nice but on the far side of the carpark. Breakfast had a reasonable range but staff were rather rude. While walking through the breakfast room with my empty plate a staffer called after me loudly 'Where are you going?"" and, when told I was putting my plate on the collection trolley, waved his hand impatiently and grunted I should put my plate on the trolley he was pushing around the breakfast room (which was already making it difficult for guests to move around - why not put the trolley in a less busy area and walk the dishes over, using a tub for collection if necessary?). Forget service with a smile, everyone who worked there seemed to be dialling it in rather than genuinely enjoying their jobs and interacting with guests. 

While the main photo promoting the hotel is by the steps in the back car park and is is no reflection of the overall quality of the hotel. There were ants in our room so it was impossible to put food anywhere other than in the fridge. The bathroom had chipped tiles and peeling paint. While it's close to the subway and there's a hospital nearby, the location is in a seedy part of town and not the glamorous Hollywood implied in publicity materials. Staff kept more than a dozen guests waiting in the foyer from 2pm to past the 3pm checkin time while they did 'handover',  when clearly rooms were available and the backlog could have been cleared by checking in some guests slightly earlier. Hotel has seen much better days, was clearly quite upmarket 20 years ago but has only been updated in a slapdash fashion since. Worse, the car park area was resurfaced on a very hot day and cordoned off so guests could not access the pool. There was no notice to this to guests in signage or messages at checkin and staff appeared indifferent to the inconvenience this caused.",,,2.0,2.0,,3.0,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-12-18,"Dear Guest,

NewInCanada,96,"Toronto, Canada",2017-11-30,BUSINESS,2017-11-19,1,Look at other hotels,"It looked good online and that is almost where the positives stop. 

Cynthia in reception was helpful. The breakfast staff were friendly. 

I was initially given a room which must have last been refurbished in the 80s. 

Extremely worn out and dirty fittings. Very noisy even after I switched off every electrical appliance / item in the room. Just horrible. Did not get any sleep. 

They changed my room and that was much better but still nothing special. 

Poor housekeeping, rude reception staff who refused to make eye contact or listen to my concerns. The bar was never open. 

My credit card statement shows an overcharge and is yet to be rectified. 

This is an old, worn out property with staff who don’t realize that they are in the hospitality sector. ",,,,,,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-11-28,"Dear Guest...

angie3002,27,,2017-10-31,FAMILY,2017-11-08,4,Not a bad choice..,"Going to see my son in the Silver Lake area of LA on a quick trip, I did not want to spend a lot of time stuck in traffic going back and forth to a hotel. Hollywood Hotel was the perfect choice as it was only 5min drive time to my son's apt. I requested an early check-in as we arrived on a early morning flight from the east coast and were exhausted. The hotel did not appear busy or crowded when we got there at approx 1130am. We were told that only one of our two reserved rooms was ready (that one being on the ground floor very near to front lobby and with construction going on next to it on adjoining room)..I asked for two rooms next to each other..then we were told it would be at minimum 1:30p before the rooms would be ready..we were finally given rooms at a little after 2:30p..regular check-in was 3p..so much for early check-in..maybe it was because I made the reservation on hotels.com rather than directly with Hollywood Hotel site? Hotels.com had a MUCH better price..
My room (307) was clean, mostly fine. The wallpaper border was very 80's contrasting with the more modern furniture and drapes..the bathroom was clean but in dire need of upgrading..the tub/shower was weirdly deceiving..you stepped into and it was much higher than it looked-so much so that any one taller than 5'7"" would not be able to stand under the shower head.
The pool area was nice. Didn't swim as it was a bit cold. The courtyard was a nice surprise..enjoyed an impromptu dinner there with carryout from the Filipino restaurant a few blocks away (Manila Sunset).
Breakfast buffet was decent..cook to order eggs and waffles were greatly appreciated..breakfast meats and potatoes not so good. Cooked hot oatmeal would have been nice too instead of instant packets..
I would definitely stay at Hollywood Hotel next time I visit. Good location to get to Hollywood, Koreatown, even Disneyland!",,,,,,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-11-10,"Dear Guest,

There's a nice balcony patio to have coffee or just relax, also a beautiful atrium area where they have a small happy hour.  Appetizers are for free but you do have to purchase your drinks. You do have to pay for parking on these grounds but the price of the parking is made up for with the made to order breakfast. Breakfast is included and it's very nice.

Jen Lacsina,1,,2017-11-30,COUPLES,2017-11-04,4,Free Upgrade!,"I recommend this place because it’s in Downtown so it’s closer to everything especially because me and my husband loves Koreatown! We just had a little complication with the parking because when I booked my reservation they didn’t mentioned that we need to pay additional for the parking and it was $26.50 for one night. (Not exactly sure if it’s per night cuz we’re only staying for a night). They also had problems with their gate because I think it was broken so we had to go back to the exit so that’s kind of annoying. However, Ali the front desk was great! He accommodated my request to King bed 3rd floor facing the court yard, instead of our original Standard Queen bed. The room was clean yet I think they need a renovation because some of the walls are old and cracked. Also, they have a complimentary breakfast which is a plus and their food is amazing!

MaggieMay065,14,"Vista, California",2017-10-31,NONE,2017-10-30,5,Wonderful staff and excellent location for getting to the Pantages.,"We had tickets to Hamilton at the Pantages and needed a hotel.  After checking reviews,  we elected to stay at the Hollywood Hotel, and were so happy with our choice.  We arrived early and the staff was wonderful,  Elias & Katie handled the check-in and offered to hold our luggage until our room opened up,  and after lunch,  we secured our room.  Wow!  What a beautiful room,  newly remodeled, beautifully decorated, clean and classy.  The  bathroom had a rain shower, fluffy towels, bathrobes and high-quality cosmetic production...to include a shaving kit.  Who does that??!!!   The included breakfast had made to order omelettes, fresh fruit, pastries, and drinks.   This hotel is two short blocks from the red line metro which will take you to/from union station and to many highlights,  including the Pantages, in LA.    Wonderful experience.  We'll be back.

World Series Bedbugs!,"We should have left when the guy at the front desk checked us into a double full size room instead of the single queen we had requested. He said it was an “upgrade.” We didn’t fit into a bed together, so we slept separately. The walls and light switches were dirty...speaking of lights the lamps near our bed went out! We stayed there only one night but it was long enough for my husband and I to get bedbug bites! I had to throw away my suitcase and call an exterminator! We left without taking a shower because the shower had mold and the mat provided was atrocious. The room needs to be updated from the floor up. We should have paid a little more to avoid having the added cost of pest control. I wish we could get our money back because pest control for bedbugs is expensive!",,,,,,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-11-07,"Dear Guest...

The hotel is nice and the customer service is great. The staff greeted us at the front desk and were very kind and helpful. The room itself is ok nothing out of this world looks a bit outdated and could use some TLC but its still in good shape. Bathroom was clean and comfortable. The thing I loved most about this place was the breakfast! They had a omelet and waffle station where a staff member would cook your choice of omelet or waffles. Breakfast was wonderful and for the price paid beats a lot of hotels I've stayed at. Overall a decent hotel its in a good location and has great breakfast and plenty of parking (which you must pay) but its LA you have to pay for parking anywhere you go.

The facilities are in tel bad shape, the BAR was under renovation , the breakfast room is in the basement which is reached thru  adark and ugly hall. There is no restaurant and no minibar even though it does have a fridge.  The bathroom was ok but run down. Maid service was terrible never replenished toiletries. The neighborhood is not sage to walk at night and there are only raunchy places nearby. The only good thing is the friendly staff.

katie s,166,"Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom",2017-10-31,COUPLES,2017-10-21,4,A retreat from the chaos...with a few niggles,"Me and my boyfriend recently stayed here for four nights. We got one of their suites with a jetted tub, which was essentially a jacuzzi in the room. Before you read ahead I want to stress that we loved our stay here, it was so convenient for us to do all of the generic touristy things. There were just a few niggles.

I'll start with the pros:
- everything was very clean.
- the suite was huge and the jacuzzi was a godsend- the jacuzzi also filled up VERY quickly.
- breakfast was lovely with fresh waffles, an omelette station, and all the things you would expect from a continental breakfast too.
- the decor was modern.
- the TVs had lots of channels.
- there was ample parking.
- the bed was very comfy.

Cons:
- the pool was essentially unusable. It was ice cold. When we got to the pool no one else was there...but after we tried getting in, we understood why.
- the sofa in our suite smelt REALLY bad- as if none of the cushion covers had ever been cleaned.
- the hotel parking was extortionate, and I felt as though it was a great way for them to take advantage of their guests. It ended up being just short of £30 per day, which you know is bad when you can leave your car next to the Hollywood walk of fame for less! I just don't understand why they can't just set a daily rate and be done with it, without feeling the need to add extras. Especially considering we had already paid for the most expensive room in the place.
- the maids were not consistent with the toiletries/coffee refills. Sometime they would be replaced, sometimes they wouldn't. 
- the temperature for our shower was backwards; cold was hot and hot was cold.
- the fridge in our room didn't work.
- there is only one running machine in the gym, so people would end up awkwardly waiting for you to get off.

Overall, this place did end up being our sanctuary from the chaos and scruffiness of LA, but as with everywhere you go there are things that you could easily pick at.",,,,,,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-10-23,"Dear Guest

I researched Trip Advisor for a nice hotel that was somewhat near the theater. We stayed one night, on October 14th. Our room was on the 2nd floor. Of the 4 lamps in the room, only 2 of them worked. The mini refrigerator was turned on but wasn't cold. There was a metal cover on the ceiling of the shower that was rusting. The room definitely needed to be refurbished. The next morning, we got up and there were ants in the bathroom, coming out from beneath the tub. To say the least, we packed as quickly as we could and got out of there. When I checked out, I mentioned all of these items to the clerk, who wrote them down. I don't understand why this hotel got such positive reviews of their rooms. The clerks were polite but I would never recommend this hotel based on the room we stayed in.",,,,,,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-10-23,"Dear Guest,

SunderlandMal,25,,2017-09-30,COUPLES,2017-10-11,2,Unimpressed,"Last minute booking as changed holiday due to the hurricane in Florida .
The room we were given was adequate but we found a lack of sockets and were thankful we had taken an extension with 3 sockets. The air conditioning for the room made a horrendous noise , we could not use , but ok as out all day and the heat was bearable on the evenings . We never complained as we were only there 3 nights before moving on thankfully.
Breakfast was nice and had a good selection of breads in the morning , bagels were very nice , the chap who made the omelettes had an eye for the women , very talkative and attentive , when it came to the men could hardly be bothered to raise his head.
The worst of all was when we checked out , the only words we got were ""ok"" wish I got the name of this gent but he checked us in and looked to be the most senior in the reception area .
Hotel parking was easy enough at a cost .
Would not return to this hotel and gave it two stars due to the easy parking and breakfast .

Tarjei TF.,6,,2017-09-30,FRIENDS,2017-09-30,4,"FANTASTIC (and GREAT omelettes!) + packages, cleanliness, room and area","This hotel impressed me as soon as I got to the room, and the breakfast. 

BREAKFAST: 
The breakfast here is very good! I LOVE that you can get a specially made egg/omelette designed by your desires. Hugo made most of my delicious breakfasts, and MMMM, where they good! Also, I could fill up with some spinach and fruits, which is EXACTLY what a European like me likes!  
  

AREA:
The area the hotel is in, is ... okay. Unfortunately, we see the lack of stable work, good economy and healthy living in some of the areas nearby. HOWEVER, this HOTEL is AWESOME. 

SERVICE AND ROOM:
I found the attitude of service to be quite alright, and the rooms to be absolutely excellent. I LOVE that you have a refrigerator in the room. The cleaning done is TOP notch. There's a very experienced lady there who seem to oversee the cleaning etc. that is done. SHE IS A PROOOOFESSIONAL. She REALLY lifts the quality of service of the entire hotel. A VERY detailed and helpful madam, who knows how to communicate with her staff.  

PACKAGES: 
Receiving packages here costs $5. 
They don't bring the package to your room. 
They take $5 for each package, no matter how big or small, just to store it in the reception area. 
Hey, I was the one who chose to have the packages sent, so I take full responsibility for the $20 I unknowingly had to pay. However, my impression of the hotel and the service there was GREATLY decreased, knowing they don't even bring the package to your room for such a fee.  

Overall, I was very satisfied with our visit here, especially since I ALWAYS choose to remember my experiences and impressions based mostly on all the positive experiences. That's where the emphasis should be when it comes to life experiences: What you LOVED. So thank you for so many things to love about this hotel :)",,,4.0,,4.0,,5.0,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-10-03,"Dear Guest,

Hotel S,1,"Mountain View, California",2017-09-30,FAMILY,2017-09-29,5,Excelent Upgrades,"I have been staying at this hotel for few years now, due to proximity to CHLA.  It has changed over period of time for the better.  The new upgrades are better, however, I do want to share my opinion, for them to improve upon.  First, convenient plugs near the night stands and desk would be most important with USB chargers for the needs of the guests.  Second, reduce the size of the soap substantially and introduce liquid soap, shampoo, conditioner in the tub area, liquid soap and hand lotion near the sink, to reduce wastage of soap.  Lastly, put a rug near the bed, so the guests do not have to put their feet on cold floor.  
Overall, renovation is really good.  One more item, I would do is to get rid of decoration over the trellis in the food area, since it does accumulate dust, and believe me, it probably is really dusty.
I hope the management will take my comments positively to improve on.",,5.0,4.0,,,5.0,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-10-09,"Dear Dilip

Tom C,30,"San Antonio, Texas",2017-09-30,COUPLES,2017-09-28,5,Outstanding Hotel,"I'm almost at a loss for words to describe how superior this hotel is. You can be fooled from the street side appearance - I've driven past it on other trips without a thought - but once you pull into the parking lot, you sense you've found a jewel.

And a jewel it is; from the service, to the rooms, the courtyard balcony, the secluded pool, the beautiful entry fountain, and the care that's been taken to make this a fine hotel... I can't say enough to communicate how absolutely wonderful this hotel is.

Now folks - I've traveled. 100's of thousands of miles. 4 & 5-star Chicago, NY, Scottsdale - you name it - and this is now my favorite hotel / stay of all time.

Just look at the pictures; beautiful. But the kicker - the people. Just plain pleasant / nice. Not that ""I'm hoping for a tip, rear-kiss, fake nice"" (you know what I mean) but genuinely ""I'm glad to see you, neighborly, don't hate my job nice"".

Location is fairly easy access from highway, fringe of Koreatown, smack in the middle of all the Hollywood sights.

Our only problem ? We had a one night stay : (  Booked ahead, we had a ridiculously low $125 rate (breakfast & parking included) for what I rate as a true 5-star hotel.

We have family that live & work in Hollywood and we'll never even consider staying anywhere else - EVER.

Place was originally built in 1904 (?) and I have never seen any building, much less a hotel, that old that has been put into this impeccable condition. Absolutely the cleanest smelling room I've ever walked in to.

One call to the Hollywood hotel and the passports were removed from the room safe, kept safe behind reception and posted to us in San Francisco.

Gioinharrogate,74,"Harrogate, United Kingdom",2017-07-31,FAMILY,2017-09-12,1,Check your bill before you leave,"On 19/07/2017 I booked this hotel for 3 nights (after we were let down by Airbnb with the host cancelling our stay 3 days before we were due to arrive there) through Agoda ( reservation number 202863187) and paid in full 656.90 dollars (I was charged £503.52 on 20/07).
When we got to the hotel on 22/07 I realised we had a big queen size bed for the three of us and asked if they could upgrade us; unfortunately they did not have a bigger room (with two double beds). They offered me a folding bed but I said no: I felt the price they quoted me for the bed was too high, especially considering that those beds are rubbish anyway. 
Internet and breakfast were included. I left the rental car on the road outside, paying the meter when I had to and I didn't use their garage.
When I checked out they said there was nothing to pay and in fact there should have not been. 
On receiving my credit card statement I then noticed I was charged 130.80 dollars possibly on the day I left (the charge appears on my statement on 27/07/2017). For what if I did not use any other services? It should have not been for the bed we never got (they should have charged me on the day we arrived I suppose) and everything else I had paid up front for.
I have contacted Agoda (they have been excellent) and through them I have sent 3 emails to the hotel. They have not even had the decency to reply.
Not only we did not sleep well, I was overcharged and finished paying for a service I did not get. It's not for the money I spent plenty in the States (travelling with two children), it is for the principle.
It suffices to say I’d never use this place again. This might have originally been an honest mistake but I invite fellow travellers to be careful on departure and always check the bill.",,,1.0,2.0,,4.0,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-09-25,"Dear Guest

twnyc,59,,2017-08-31,FAMILY,2017-09-02,3,A Basic No Frills Acceptable Hotel,"This is a basic three star hotel (towards the lower end of the 3 star range).  I personally do not know how people would give it 4 or 5 stars.

The hotel is a renovated Ramada Inn, located in an older area of Hollywood, that has seen better days.  The area is not the prettiest, but is far from dangerous.  It is the commercial strip of a working class/immigrant section.  There are some homeless people, but that has been an unfortunate trend all over Los Angeles (and the country) as of late.  

The hotel is pretty centrally located, basically within 30 minutes of anywhere you would want to go as a tourist (except Disneyland, which is actually in Anaheim in Orange County, about an hour away).  The Walk of Fame in Hollywood, Rodeo Drive Venice Beach, Santa Monica, Malibu, Melrose Avenue, etc., are all 30 minutes or less away.  I lived in Los Angeles for a while, so I know the layout of the city, and the location was a definite plus.

The hotel is a little odd, as the furnishing from one room to another seem to vary greatly (from what I could see of other rooms when the doors were opened while the maid was cleaning it), ranging from somewhat tired looking hotel furnishings, to new ones.

We were given a room with two queen beds that was described as one of their larger rooms.  It was pretty small, by modern hotel standards, but did the job.  However, I would hate to see what they consider a small room...  

The rooms were clean, the bathroom was clean, the halls were newly renovated and clean.  The common areas were perfectly nice.  There is gated parking for about $27/day, which seems to be the standard for the LA area.

There were a couple of things that were a little off-putting. 

First was the shower, specifically the shower-head.  The bathtub was actually raised off the floor, as if it was built on a step.  So getting out of the bathtub/shower, the step down was pretty far, and I am 6'2"" and saying that.  Also, the shower head was placed on the wall where it should have been if the tub portion was level with the rest of the bathroom floor.  I am not sure if I am explaining that well, but suffice to say the shower head was about 8"" lower on the wall than you would expect it to be.  I have no explanation for this, and it was annoying, but nothing more.  The bathroom also showed a little sign of extended use around the edges, mostly in the ceiling are above the tub.  Of course since I literally had to duck to take a shower, I was probably closer to the ceiling than I normally would have been, and nothing a quick paint job with mildew resistant paint could not fix.

The elevators are painfully slow.  We were on the second floor, so we took the stairs more often than not.  Plus the floor indicator light is out on at least one of them, and I may me mistaken, but I think the inspection certificate is also expired.  But they are newly renovated, not crummy or anything like that.

The breakfast buffet, and I use that term loosely, is included.  Personally I found the whole omelette station that people seem to rave about kind of annoying.  An omelette station may be a nice addition to a buffet, but if you want any eggs, you have to see the omelettes guy.  And if you are like me, and aren't the biggest fan of omelettes and want something exotic, like say basic scrambled eggs, the guy will give you major attitude, and make you wait off to the side for an extra couple of minutes, to let you know who is the boss I guess.  He sort of reminded me of the soup guy on Seinfeld.  
Other than omelettes, they have the usual cereal, fruit, bagels, toast, orange juice, coffee, etc.  They also have covered trays of some rather cheap tasting sausage and hash browns.  It would seem to make more sense to have a tray of scrambled eggs, as opposed to waiting in line for an omelette, or waiting in the corner near the line, for the omelette-meister to get around to your scrambled eggs.  Also, I have never seen sausages without bacon.

The coffee was actually surprisingly good however.

I cannot comment on effectiveness of the hotel staff, other than to say they were perfectly nice, and checked us in without issue and our rooms were always made up when we got back from wherever we went for the day.  Our stay was uneventful so we really had no interaction with them beyond that.  

The pool is nice, and is in a gated area off the parking lot.  It is secluded, but is just a pool with some furniture around it.  The only thing is that it supposedly closed at 8 PM, which is early.  However, we did see people sitting out there until at least 10 PM.  There was no poolside service, but you can get a bottle of wine at the store across the street and sit around with some friends without issue.  I am not sure if it was because the hotel staff didn't notice, or didn't care.  Either one is possible.

In defense of the hotel, I read a few reviews by people complaining of musty smells in the hallways and around various areas of the hotel.  I smelled it too, it wasn't musty, it was marijuana.  Marijuana is legal in California, and is sold at the retail level at numerous stores all over the city, in fancy and not so fancy areas.  In fact my 14 year old daughter opined there were more pot stores than Starbucks.  You will smell this all over town, not just in and around this hotel.

Also, I saw a picture of a squashed cockroach prominently displayed with one review.  Cockroaches are my Achilles' heel, so I was on guard after seeing that.  I did not see one roach, and believe me I was looking.  The place is quite clean.  Also, I don't think that picture is of a cockroach but a Palmetto Bug, one of those nasty flying roaches from the tropics, which they also have (in smaller numbers than the tropics) in LA.

Overall it is a no-service hotel that is more like a motel.  There is no room service, but being in the middle of Hollywood, and with all the app based delivery services around, you don't need it.  Also, if you want drinks by the pool, you have to bring your own.",Largest they have,,3.0,,4.0,3.0,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-12-18,"Dear Guest,

Phil M,8,"Atlanta, Georgia",2017-08-31,COUPLES,2017-09-01,5,Great small hotel in a great location,"I generally don't write hotel reviews but Hollywood Hotel deserved a good review.  My wife and I accidentally ended up at Hollywood Hotel when an Airbnb rental fell through after we got to LA.  We found the hotel online through others that gave good reviews, and we couldn't have been happier. 

What we liked:
- good price
- very clean and well-maintained
- very friendly, helpful staff, particularly the front desk
- well-performed daily maid service
- GREAT complementary breakfast
- good location for our needs:  two sons in LA close to the hotel; Griffith Park is close by for hiking; we have lots of favorite restaurants and cafes in the Hollywood area; good shopping for normal people (Home Depot, Target, H&M, Rite Aid, wash and fold, etc.) - lots of tourist stuff in the area but we weren't in LA for that.
- Nice pool area (we didn't use it much but it was clearly a plus)

There was just the two of us (seniors) but we saw families, small international groups (2-3 couples traveling together), and business travelers and everyone seemed to be getting along fine.

If you're high maintenance and need room service, plush bathrobes and mints on the pillow, go somewhere else.  But if you're looking for a clean, comfortable, friendly home base for your trip you should check out Hollywood Hotel.",,,,,,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-09-04,"Dear Guest...

J C,4,"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",2017-08-31,SOLO,2017-08-27,4,Excellent stay!,"First of all, the grounds are beautiful, wonderfully landscaped, and the courtyard is no exception - it was a pleasure to have the views from the room balcony and second floor terrace of the cypress trees and palms, lights, and fountain in the courtyard. The room was nice, bathroom spotless with a very nice walk-in shower and vanity, and bed was always well-made.

Staff were courteous and helpful with questions, and breakfast selection downstairs was great. Hugo was the breakfast chef and will make any kind of omelette with a generous selection of ingredients! The downstairs cafe is very nicely furnished as well, and of course everything has Hollywood-inspired design.

A few things that kept the excellent stay from being that much better--the air-conditioning in the room is on the louder side, but maybe unavoidable with the type of unit, and the elevators were VERY slow for being only several floors--ended up taking the stairs most times. Also, the downstairs cafe being only accessible through a bare stairwell corridor took away from being otherwise surrounded by gorgeous design and architecture.

Overall, though, would HIGHLY recommend and wish I could have stayed longer! Thanks!

DavidHalford82,9,,2017-08-31,COUPLES,2017-08-27,4,Good base of operations for tourists,"We recently stayed at this hotel and while it might not be in the best part of town, I never felt unsafe. The hotel is really close to the metro station and bus station, giving you instant access to a large part of the city. You can easily take the red line to Universal Studios or the Walk of Fame, or the 704 bus all the way to Santa Monica Pier, all for $1.75 each. 

The hotel itself was clean, with very helpful staff. The first night we had issues with a crazy lady screaming outside our window, but staff promptly moved us to a better, quieter room that faces the courtyard. Breakfast was ample, there's even a cook that will make you whatever you want. ",,,,,,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-08-29,"Dear Guest...

drvir,76,"Mumbai, India",2017-08-31,COUPLES,2017-08-19,3,Hotel with a good location and cozy rooms,"Booked this hotel very last minute after going through a couple of reviews, the hotel itself is located on the outskirts of Hollywood , but when I say Its conveniently located I mean it's easy to get to most places from here, cos it's 10mins drive from downtown as well as central Hollywood , so it's like somewhat in the centre of both , 6-7min drive from sunset strip...
The rooms are clean and beds are comfortable , the AC is a bit noisy and may turn off at night , but once you inform the reception bout it they change the settings and have it on. 
The breakfast is very average, just had it for one day
The front desk staff can be more courteous, we were checked out by someone named Gisel, who didn't come across as very friendly.
All in all it's a good option for the price your paying as it's conveniently located to get to either DTLA or H'wood.",,,,,,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-08-21,"Dear Guest,

Donnie S,1,,2017-08-31,FAMILY,2017-08-13,1, Not recommended,"Not recommended. Booked this room through Expedia and feel completely disappointed and scammed. The facility is in complete disrepair with some random updates throughout. The first night the water pipes inside bathroom wall burst @ 3am flooding the room. The next day I asked to speak with the manager about the incident. The desk clerk was rude and refused to reimburse any charges. She advised me that they had taken care of me by moving me to a new room (really?!). She also told me that my parking fees would be comped for the inconvenience, however I was still billed at checkout. The parking lot would have been secure but the automatic gate was either broken or out of tickets every time we went in/out. The phone in both rooms did not function. There was no house keeping service provided even when we left the placard on the door requesting it. I attempted to contact the President/ CEO, Jeff Zarrinnam, and have not received any response at this time. ",,,,,,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-09-22,"

Amy W,34,"Durham, United Kingdom",2017-08-31,COUPLES,2017-08-11,3,Better than most in the area,"Me and my husband stayed here for three nights 8-10 August 2017. We booked a king suite with jacuzzi bath tub (room 136) and our first impressions of the room were very good. The jacuzzi bath was great, and the free shower gel/shampoo/soap etc was quite 'upmarket' compared to other hotels I've stayed in. The suite had a small kitchen area with coffee making facilities/microwave/fridge - all in good working order. The sofa and chairs in the room were extremely comfortable and a nice touch with designer cushions on the sofa. The decor in the room was really lovely, although the lighting was pretty poor in the room, despite it being double aspect. There was lots of space in the room with nice tiled floors, although the floors could have done with a clean, as walking around bare footed left us both with lots of dust on our feet. The bed & pillows were very comfy and was made up every day we stayed there, along with fresh towels daily. There was a secure safe in the room, which we used. The bathroom was quite small, but I suppose big enough for what we needed. The main issue with our stay here was the air conditioning in the room was practically non existent! When we entered the room we noticed it was particularly warm, but we put this down to the air con not being on before we checked in, however, we then noticed two tower fans in the wardrobe area and came to the conclusion that the room being warm must be a recurring issue. I reported the ineffective air con to reception and they offered us an alternative room, however, this was a room almost a quarter of the size, not a suite and no jacuzzi bath - with no offer of a refund or partial refund even though I'd be moving to a much lesser room. They informed us that they only have one king suite with jacuzzi bath in the whole hotel. We decided against the move, but I must say the heat in the room did spoil our stay a little. In the end we were refunded two nights parking fees ($52), not great but it was better than nothing! The parking is quite expensive ($26 per night) but it is a secure car park and I'm glad we used it as the area around the hotel is a little run down (but this does not affect the hotel quality). The pool area is lovely and we used this twice during our stay. There are towels and a shower provided at the pool, along with cold water for drinking. We also used the sauna, which was a lovely little extra. Breakfast was great with lots of variety - fresh eggs cooked to order, sausage, breads, muffins, waffles, cereal, fruit juice - plenty of choice to say the least! The front desk staff were always very pleasant and helpful, particularly Michael. We also had a number of relatives who stayed in this hotel at the same time as us and they were all very pleased with their rooms also. 

The hotel is very well situated for visiting Hollywood, Central LA, Universal Studios, Mulholland Drive etc. There are lots of eateries close by and we also ordered take out to our room, which was great.

azinim,5,"San Clemente, California",2017-08-31,FAMILY,2017-08-11,1,My daughter's surgery,"If I could rate it zero I would.  This hotel has no service at all. You can't even pull up in front the door to check in since there is no one to help.   Other guest were honking for us to get out of the way while we were advised by the reception staff to unload our Luggage.  We had to wait for our room to be ready even though it was past the check in time.  The light switch did not work by the door and the air conditioner blew warm air. We called the first night and the front desk insisted that we needed to wait all night to feel it cool down. We did and it didn't. We tried to call the second night after a whole day in the hospital and the phones weren't working. We called the next day and they assured us it will be fixed. It wasn't. The remote control didn't work and the fridge didn't work and had a broken knob. My friend left her glasses on the bed and the house cleaning somehow made it disappear. The final straw was when I tried to check out at noon and called for assistance with my luggage. They were shocked at my audacity to ask for bell service. So it took me 20 mins to take my belongings for the week to my car which was parked across the parking lot from the 3rd floor. I must add that the elevator ride alone in 5 mins minimum it's so slow. Once I get to the front desk they inform me they charged me $50 for checking out 30 mins late. The front door staff were talking to each other in front of the guest using profanity. I quote:"" you should try this candy, it's f...in amazing!""
Seriously! This hotel charged me $250 for one night and $170 for the other nights (m-fri) Plus $24/night for self parking in the scary parking lot with queen size mattress by the gate, plus tax.  The rate goes up to $450 per night.  The only positive is the short distance to the children's hospital which I may add has a better shower than this hotel.

So they said they'd look into it maybe change the system privacy and they Re-accommodated me in another room the next day and was much happier with the new room provided like the pictures or what I had paid for I am guessing they're was an issue on booking.com and therefor the room I paid for was not their best room if I had known before I wouldn't of stayed there for that price in the budget room and they managed to give me another room as their was a fault with that room an that was more appealing and that looked better and it was the ones I noticed on their website!..

rhodeygem,323,,2017-07-31,SOLO,2017-07-29,3,A little too noisy and just a little off....,"I had scheduled four nights, and had spoken directly to the staff to get the reservation. I had explained that I really needed a quiet room, since I can't sleep with lots of weird noise.
Checking in was different than any hotel I've ever been too.  First of all, a computerized sign in, then a statement that a $100 deposit is taken from every guest.  When I inquired as to why, I was told that often people watch HBO movies, and the deposit helps to cover that. 
Most hotels just inform you that any additional charges will be put on the credit card that you register with, so I have no idea why they need to take a deposit! ( perhaps it's needed if folks pay in cash) 
Back to the noise.... my room was in the back, overlooking the parking lot.  The room was extremely hot when I checked in, and I was told that it would take about 20 minutes for the AC to cool it down. Well.... 2 hours later' the room was still 78 degrees.  Also, I couldn't open the sliding door, to cool things down, because first, it would automatically turn off the AC, and second, it was not safe, as all of the balconys connect, with only a very short (less than 2 ft high) barrier between adjacent rooms. 

The AC unit was incredibly loud!  It never stopped running all night, and yet it was very hot in the room.  I got very little sleep that night. 

In the morning, I spoke to the front desk manager, and thankfully, she did agree to let me check out without any additional fees.  I did have breakfast, and it was ok, but unlike others, the omelette chef did not impress me at all. He wasn't very friendly, and, my omelette was raw in the middle.  Yes, raw, runny egg juice running from inside my omelet,  gross!

I did take a look at the pool it looked ok. It is off to one side of the parking lot.  But for the middle/edge of Hollywood, it is
Did seem like a little oasis.

Lastly, I was there on family business. I can not understand why a tourist would bother to go to Hollywood.  The Chinese theatre, and all of the surrounding junk is hardly worth the hype.  
I'd rather be at the beach!

Dennis_The_Cat,12,"Cumbernauld, United Kingdom",2017-07-31,FAMILY,2017-07-29,4,"Clean, friendly and good location","Our room was clean, tidy and housekeeping services were excellent throughout our stay. A little more room for cases and clothes wouldn't have gone amiss though. There was a lovely internal courtyard in the hotel as well as a TV, fridge and tea/coffee making facilities in room. 
The inclusive buffet breakfast was also welcome, although the quality and freshness of some items (such as croissants and hash browns) was questionable. Chef-prepared waffles and omlettes were good though! 
The big bonus of this hotel was that it is only one block away from a metro stop (Vermont/Santa Monica) taking us directly to Hollywood Boulevard, Universal City and also downtown. Directly across the road from the metro stop is a regular bus which goes to Beverly Hills and Santa Monica (via Santa Monica Boulevard), although admittedly the latter is over one hour away. Whilst there was little in the immediate vicinity of the hotel to entice us to stay there for an evening, there were a few shops within minutes walk plus a garage where water, etc could be obtained. 
The area surrounding the hotel isn't the most attractive but it was perfectly safe. Be aware that there is a 'tented village' at the end of the street immediately next to the hotel on the way to the metro stop, but this didn't cause us any problems. 
Can't comment on driving in LA as we took public transport everywhere. The metro service is very poor compared to London, Paris, New York, Chicago, .... but with a little patience and pre-planning you'll get where you need to be and without the hassle of having to park a car when you get there.",,3.0,5.0,5.0,,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-08-08,"Dear Guest,

ANerak12,1,,2017-07-31,NONE,2017-07-28,2,"Foul stench, unsafe but convenient location","The hotel itself is outdated, we didn't mind but just needed to be clean. There were red stains on our duvet which I brought attention to the front desk 'Elvira' from housekeeping came up and claimed it was nail polish but did not replace the duvet. It was gross. Upon entering the lobby customers desk are dark, tall and uninviting the ceilings are low and hallways are dark. There's a foul stench in the front elevator whatever they were using let off a musky egg smell. The hotel itself is located near public transport - 10 minute walk to the subway and it was 15-20 minutes to get to Universal studios which is the hotels biggest strengths. We felt very unsafe and avoided going out at night. There are a lot of homeless people in the area, the street next to the hotel had a line of tents which house the homeless.You would have to drive to get to nicer restaurants there was a nice Mexican place and a pizza hut in the small plaza but that's about it. The front desk was helpful about giving information in regards to public transport which was good. Also, Hugo the chef is boss he makes some mean omelettes and waffles for you! 

Pros: Nice buffet breakfast, close to public transport, close to universal studios
Cons: Felt unsafe, especially at night, cleanliness is poor

ALSO: The front photo you see is the back of the hotel. You will see the lovely fountain if you enter the carpark!",,,,,,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-08-22,"Dear Guest

Monti D,9,,2017-07-31,FAMILY,2017-07-28,5,Nice Stay at the Hollywood Hotel,"The Hollywood Hotel is a nicely run, tidy, and serene hotel in the midst of downtown Hollywood. I stayed there for two nights with my mom as we were back in LA after many years to see some of her old friends from way back when. We stayed in a double room, with two queen size beds. The mattresses were a bit firm, but that did not inhibit a good night's sleep. My mom had an important observation about the floors, however. There are no carpets, so do be careful when walking out from the shower onto the tile floor. Bring a pair of slippers or socks to wear in the room so as to avoid any chance of slipping. That said, the room was otherwise quite nice. The breakfast buffet downstairs is good, with fresh omelettes made to order by a friendly chef. All of the staff we encountered were helpful, friendly, and professional. Michael greeted us at the front desk upon our arrival and we struck up a conversation with him for about 10 minutes. He is a gentle soul. Nancy was also gracious, as was Gisel who has a lovely smile that lights up the room. The man working at the souvenir counter was so nice he gave us some fresh fruit and bottled water on the house. Would come back to the Hollywood Hotel to stay again.",,,5.0,,,4.0,5.0,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-08-08,"Dear Guest,

Nadya D,4,,2017-07-31,FAMILY,2017-07-18,2,Mini Vacation with the kids.,"This hotel was recommended to me when I booked my vacation package through JetBlue. Everyone was nice including Cynthia from the front desk, Fanny and Hugo. Everything was going well until my 11 year old asked Elvira to fry her 3 eggs extra hard. We advised her to break the yolks to ensure that the eggs were cooked hard. She got upset after she fried the eggs for awhile and the yolks were still runny and my daughter refused to eat them. I asked her a second time to break the yolks and cook them a bit longer. She got upset handed us to Hugo and walked away from the omelette and waffle station. It was so embarrassing we sacrificed a free breakfast and went out for breakfast the next morning. We went back for breakfast today before we left for the airport we were so uncomfortable due to the incident before. Being a trained chef and former culinary school graduate as well as a Starbucks manager in busy NYC I know what pressure is when dealing with the general public. However I've never been more publicly embarrassed. Especially in an atmosphere where it seems as if customer service standards are prioritized.

Arrival from airport is super easy and convent. It’s about a 20-30 minute ride from LAX - I had a late arrival from delayed flight late but staff was very helpful and checkin was a breeze. 

The location of the hotel is perfect. Just around the corner from Santa Monica BLVD / Hollywood BLVD / Sunset and more- Easy access with or without GPS- for walking, driving, and riding. 

Fanny is host of the restaurant cafe. She greets with a friendly smile and was very helpful with seating. There are huge varieties of breakfast options and treats, that seemed to keep replenishing and coming. The Chef was amazing! Chef Hugo cooked different variations of omelets and waffles. The build you own option is AWESOME! Chef Hugo’s creations were a staple to starting my day, whether exercise or exploration.

Christina L F,1,,2017-06-30,FAMILY,2017-07-05,4,Pleasantly surprised!,"The price of the room made me suspicious to begin. Approaching the hotel made me feel a worried, as well. The area directly around the hotel does not look the best. I am from Florida and it just seems like there is a more distinct divide between safer areas and areas that require more attention from local law enforcement. I spoke with the desk attendant and he told me that was the norm for L.A. So, I decided to stay. I'm glad I did. We had no issues with safety. The parking was gated. Inside the hotel was renovated and looked and felt great for the price. It was a mix of boutique and chain hotels. The location was actually very convenient although not as ""Hollywood"" as the hotel suggests. It is very close to the metro but you have to pass by a side street down which there is a ""tent city"" so I'm very glad for the car we rented. Parking was 25/day plus taxes. 

Two more mentionables. The breakfast was unexpectedly good! L.A. is expensive so it was nice to be able to have a hearty, nutritious, hearty breakfast that was included in the room cost. And, the staff was very accommodating and helpful. 

Again, pleasantly surprised which was the reason for 4 stars at a 3 star hotel.",,,,,,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-08-16,"Dear Guest,

Simon and Hanna D,35,"Melbourne, Australia",2017-06-30,COUPLES,2017-06-24,3,Great proximity to LA attractions,"We chose the Hollywood Hotel for its proximity to the attractions we wanted to see in LA, and most things around the Hollywood area are very easily accessible from the hotel. 
The hotel itself is a little old but still pleasant. We received complimentary breakfast each morning during our stay and the staff were very helpful, especially Cinthya who gave us an early check-in following a long flight.
Due to the tiled floors in the hallways every noise echoed around the hotel and could be easily heard in our room. 
Unfortunately there was no extraction fan in the bathroom meaning it got very steamy and hot after a shower and the shower curtain was basically useless, causing shower water to spill out onto the bathroom floor making it slippery and unsafe.
Not the best hotel we've stayed in, with its proximity to some great LA attractions a highlight. ",,,,,,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-06-26,"

I mean what is the ""do not disturb"" sign for if they are going to come in anyway and disregard your wishes??! Not good. When they did come  in they did not replace bath mat or non skid mat as shower floor was very slippery.

Budget hotel at best. Common areas are better maintained than rooms themselves.    Shower stalls are small, old, and uninviting​. I almost did not want to walk in the shower barefoot as it did not appear clean.
Beds are VERY hard. And VERY uncomfortable.

Was excited when we learned of an on-site bar only to be told that it was closed for renovations. (Not the courtyard bar, which is only open a couple of hours early evening). This bar states it's open til 11 pm downstairs and is stated on their property website under ""amenities"".

Arrived on a Wednesday and lieu of the bar, there was an alternate area serving drinks with a comedian. When we tried to go-to the bar the following Saturday, found out only by trying to go-to the bar, that there was in fact no bar downstairs at all. When we inquired along with another guest to the very unhelpful girl at the front desk, she acted like she didn't know what we were talking about and said there was no bar. We had to keep asking her questions because she was not offering any answers in regards to it. When asked when is the bar open she said ""it varies"". 
What kind of answer is that? Very unprofessional.

Neighborhood is sketchy. Would not dare to walk anywhere after dark.

Best pictures are showing from the rear of the hotel in the parking lot (which is gated), the courtyard, and the common areas.  All very pretty.

They offer a free made to order breakfast which is nice, although we didn't have the time to check it out.

I think what upset me the most is that after we asked for a late check-out, (noon) it was 11:40am and the hotel turned the air off in the room and housekeeping was already opening our door, again with the do not disturb sign posted. As if, to tell us to get out already. If 12 noon is check out, then why proceed to make your guests last experience an uncomfortable one?

Overall, would not stay here again and do not recommend it. One can not put a price on privacy and safety. Spend the extra money and stay elsewhere. It is a price point hotel and is not cheap. I expected far more in professionalism for a one-off property that relies on reviews for their  business.",first floor is very noisy,3.0,3.0,,2.0,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-06-26,"Dear Guest,

The check-in was easy and quick, the lady at the desk also gave us lots of information about tours and packages which the hotel provided one of which we attended and was brilliant!! Room was clean and inviting with a fridge, microwave and a safe which was very useful for an international couple. We used uber to get around which was awesome as LA is a huge place to explore there is also a metro station 10 minutes down the road which takes you anywhere in central LA for a very cheap price. We travelled to universal studios using the metro which we found incredibly easy. The breakfast was lovely however I would of liked to have a breakfast buffet as well so I could have made myself a bacon sandwich or something for a change instead of waffles. The only other down points were that the bar wasn't open at all while we were there which in the end didn't bother us too much but it could have done. Also the area the hotel is in isn't brilliant it was a bit unnerving for a British couple on their first trip to America but travel past the metro and their is a lovely street with restaurants, bars and a few shops which was lovely.

AndrewFromSF,1,,2017-06-30,COUPLES,2017-06-05,3,Nice Hotel - Execution Could Be Better,"Overall, the experience was fine. The room could have been cleaner. My room had two beds, and both had sand in them.  The bathroom had quite a few left over strands of hair on the floor and in the shower stall. And the bathroom door had no lock whatsoever.  The hotel is not in the best part of town, I don't think I would feel comfortable walking around at night. The daily parking fee is $24,  which seems a bit excessive.  The breakfast options are terrific though, with a large assortment of pastries, drinks, cereals, and best of all an omelette station (with a chef ready to prepare you any variety of eggs). Overall, I think it is worth it if you can get it for somewhere around $100-$120/night",,,,,,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-06-07,"Dear Guest,

roselopez776,1,,2017-05-31,FAMILY,2017-05-31,4,Hollywood Hotel - Made my first visit to LA very welcoming!,"The staff at Hollywood Hotel are very welcoming, accommodating and knowledgeable about local attractions and public transportation.  Our first evening they offered to schedule tours for us and provided detailed info about how to use public transportation to get around on our own if we preferred. The complimentary breakfast downstairs was wonderful!  The chef made our omelets to order, there were mini or large Belgian waffles also made to order and a wide variety of other breakfast food available muffins, cereal, etc. self serve orange juice, hot coffee and hot tea bar in cute little dining area kept very clean!  Every time we came through lobby I was greeted by name - nice personal touch.  There's a little store towards back of hotel that sells post cards and convenience items; the man who runs it will tell you anything you want to know about sight seeing opportunities in town he was so friendly as well and had maps available.  The hotel is like a block from the train that you can catch to anywhere in LA just about - for under 2 dollars fare each way once you buy a ""tap card"" (1.00) from vending machine.  My only regret - I wish it had been warmer during our stay so we could have enjoyed the pool area which had a unique little style, enclosed with very inviting yellow and white striped chaise lounge chairs.  The young lady at front desk printed my Universal Studio tickets out for me as well as boarding passes for return flight.  If you're looking for a luxury resort stay this is not for you but if you simply want a cozy place to stay while you explore the town where they know how to provide great customer service this is perfect for you!  We enjoyed our stay very much and would definitely return and recommend!  When I checked out on the last morning at 11:00am they even put my bags in storage for me and my son since our flight back home was not until later that evening; we were able to have one last excursion before catching a ""Lyft"" (service like Uber)  back to LAX.

I agreed with some reviewers; local area and beds are not the best. We got to the hotel at 11 pm and driving that late was a bit scary, but come on who are we kidding it's LA. The bed were really hard, but it was mentioned on the room description online. Price and accommodations were very reasonable. Our room was really big, clean, and nicely decorated. We did notice that they are in middle of remodeling the front desk, but it not bad where it feels overwhelm. Breakfast was the best. Fanny and her team were awesome and really friendly. We loved the fresh eggs and fruit. The omelet man as how we named him, was really great and fast. ",,,,,,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-06-01,"Dear Guest,

The room was nicely appointed and clean. The bathroom had peeling walls and rust spots on the ceiling and there was very little water pressure. The bed and pillows were comfortable. 

The staff in the evening was not very helpful but the morning desk clerks gave us a map of the area, printed directions for us and gave us great recommendation. Parking is $26 There is parking on the street next to the hotel but check the signs.

When we first arrived I was a bit disappointed as the hotel seemed in the middle of nowhere. But once we got our bearings it was easy to get to everywhere from this hotel. There are two subway stations close by where you can get to all the main locations in LA. We had a car and from the hotel we were within quick driving distance of everything. I would especially recommend this hotel if you have a car (although the car park is a bit steep but is secure). 

The room was lovely and modern and had everything you could need. The breakfast we only had once - wasn't very appetising and I felt a bit ill after hence why we ate elsewhere. If you have a car there are tons of restaurants within a 5 minute drive of the hotel. Also 15 minutes walk away is a strip of restaurants - we ate in Figaro when we first arrived and it was delicious.

I would stay again but highly recommend you have a car for easy access to everything LA has to offer.",,4.0,3.0,4.0,,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-06-01,"Dear Guest,

The inside area of hotel was lovely but wifi could not be obtained if you stay in a corner room. The location of the hotel is not the safest and even the 2 min walk to underground was not a pleasant experience. Word of warning. Do not turn right up the road as this is not a safe neighbourhood. Even during the day we did not feel safe. If staying in Hollywood again I would choose a completely different area/neighbourhood.

I would recommend you hire a car or use taxi's to get around...LA is not particularly pedestrian friendly it's built for the automobile!....Great place to visit plenty to see!
Fine walking about in daytime in busy areas such as Hollywood Blvd and Beverly Hills, but I would seek advice if you want to venture into Down Town LA.
There is a small shop on site selling milk water gifts etc - Not open all time but a grocery store is located over the road from hotel.
We tend to take taxis or limo's when on holiday - door to door with no wrong turns or parking problems.....makes a change from driving and you see all the sights!

sfc4749,96,"Nashville, Tennessee",2017-05-31,COUPLES,2017-05-14,3,Mixed opinion,"The Hollywood Hotel is a pretty nice hotel, partially updated. I say that because our room had new ""wood"" ceramic tile, curtains, nice beds, bedding, furniture, a refrigerator, microwave and safe in avery nice cabinet but you could see dirty spots on the wall where previous pictures were hung and the wall had not been painted. There was also an old paper border that had not been removed. I am not sure why you would spend the money and put new stuff in a room and not paint! The halls, rugs and fixtures were very nice, there was a patio bar with nice furnishings and a lovely garden. The front desk staff were very nice but the check-in was more drawn out than in most hotels. It didn't seem that there was enough staff to take care of the client's needs.While the hotel was very nice, the area was pretty seedy. There is a laundromat across the street which was nice if you need to wash clothes but, again, a little seedy and I would never be courageous enough to walk around at night in the area. So, I have mixed feelings about this hotel. I wish it were in a different location but it was a pretty good deal and a nice hotel overall. Oh, also, there is self parking in a fenced and gated parking lot, which was good. There is no restaurant on site...another bummer since we didn't want to drive and park nor would we walk around after dark.",,,,,,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-05-16,"Dear Guest,

salchesher,8,"Newcastle, Australia",2017-04-30,FRIENDS,2017-05-10,4,Overall a nice place to stay,"Hotel Hollywood is a reminder of a bygone era and our 3 day visit here in April 2017, was, on the whole, a positive experience. This commenced with being able to access our room well before check-in time which was a blessing following the flight from Australia. Our room was quite spacious but furnishings are a bit dated and the room lacked a little TLC, for example non-working power points.  Beds are quite comfortable however the rollaway bed requested was extremely uncomfortable and very noisy every time you rolled over. Furthermore the rollaway was only supplied with one blanket which resulted in a 2AM visit to reception (house phone was broken) to request additional blankets. Our room didn't have a safe but the use of a security box at the 24 hour reception was provided. The bathroom  was a little small and water pressure was low. Room had a fridge, microwave and coffee maker but alas no kettle for us tea drinkers. Breakfast in the dining room was quite good with a wide range of hot and cold options and an egg and waffle station. Reception staff were always friendly and helpful.  Whilst the immediate location in East Hollywood isn't the most salubrious address, the hotel is a short walk to both the Metro train station and Santa Monica Blvd buses.  There is a liquor and convenience store across the road, a Vons's supermarket and some fast food shops a short walk away and about a 15 minute walk to a nice enclave of restaurants in Los Feliz. On the whole we found the hotel was good value for money as we had booked during a 50% off special.

Blane W,1,,2017-04-30,FAMILY,2017-05-09,5,Great location and friendly helpful staff,"The front of house staff (Gisel and her team) were super friendly and very accommodating. I made an error with my booking but they were able to sort it out with little fuss. The breakfast was great with a selection of custom made omelets, waffles, fresh fruits, cereals, and drinks. The chef was really cool as well. There is a nice inside / outdoor courtyard as well as an outdoor pool. I found some bargains in the gift shop and enjoyed the friendly (Russian?) man working in there. The Star Line bus stops outside and the Vermont / Santa Monica train station is just down the block. This was convenient for our needs and a great base to explore LA from. There is gated off street parking. The room and hotel were very clean and tidy. Overall a great stay, I would definitely stay here again. I hope our Kiwi's are still at the front desk :) Blane - New Zealand",,4.0,5.0,5.0,,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-05-10,"Dear Guest...

AND spotlessly CLEAN! The staff was very gracious and helpful. The front desk folks wanted to ensure our safety in the neighborhood and taught us about Uber as the Metro wasn't safe at night.

Graham,192,"Wickham Bishops, United Kingdom",2017-04-30,COUPLES,2017-05-02,3,An acceptable base for visiting LA,"We chose this Hotel because of its location near a Metro station and the price.
Having read previous reviews we were aware of the locale. Whilst there were some vagrants around they were not threatening. We were unable to find any reasonable eateries locally although that was not too much of an issue as we used the metro which was relatively inexpensive to travel up to Hollywood Boulevard where there was plenty of choice. We also used the Metro to go to Downtown. 
The  Courtyard was very nice and the pool area was really well done although with all our site seeing unfortunately we did not have time to use either.
Our room was perfectly acceptable although the electrical connections were a bit iffy with the sockets having to be wiggled around to make a good connection.
The only slight downside was that the bathroom ceiling looked as though it needed a refresh.
Breakfast was included in our room rate and was perfectly acceptable with everything that was on offer being kept stocked up. Everyone refers to Hugo and he does do an excellent job producing omelettes, scrambled eggs and waffles.
If you are looking for a good value stay to visit Hollywood and LA I would not hesitate recommending this Hotel.",,,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-05-09,"Dear Guest,

Lauren Smyth,9,,2017-03-31,COUPLES,2017-05-01,4,Would Stay Again,"We stayed at this hotel from the 20/3/17 to 24/03/17. We stayed in the Suite 1, King Bed, Jetted-Tub. The room was massive. Nice and clean and everything was in working order. We paid a $30 early check-in fee which we didn't mind as we had just been on a 14hr flight. 
The front desk were polite and helpful. Hotel is about a 5min walk from the train station which took us straight to the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
The area is ok during the day, but at night we walked a little faster from the train station. A lot of homeless people (which no one can help). 
Complimentary breakfast was awesome! Although after 4 days it can get a little repetitive eating the same thing as there wasn't much variety. 
Overall, I would stay again! The price was much cheaper than other hotels!

Deborah M,93,"Mission Viejo, California",2017-03-31,COUPLES,2017-05-01,4,Last Minute Stay-Pleasantly Surprised,"We booked this hotel last minute through the Hotel Tonight App. The app gave us an extra discount, making our total less than even the junkiest hotels in the area. It is about a block from a train stop, our kids weren't with us, so we decided to take a risk. We were itchy to get on the Metro and start our drinking evening in Hollywood, so we called about 1 and asked if they could accommodate us-which they said yes. The staff at check in, Gisel and Nancy, were just awesome. Pleasant, funny, super nice to chat with-AND, after finding out we were hanging out for our anniversary weekend-upgraded us to a nicer room at no charge. Our room was great-larger than an average sized room-with a king bed, small desk, larger than average closet, and a sitting area. They gave us a chip to use for a discount at their downstairs bar later that evening. I loved the look of the hallways, older style with cute doors. Things on the plus-the bed was great, super comfy. The breakfast they serve is fantastic-made to order items, plenty of coffee and juice, they restock frequently, so nothing ran out. Staff is warm and welcoming. It is about a block to walk to the metro train, which takes you all over. If you download the Metro App, you can enter your location and destination and get several choices for travel. You will need to buy a TAP card at the train station specifically for train use, just FYI.  I've had my fill of CA traffic, so when I can grab a train, I do. The courtyard is nice, if there were drinks being served, it would be even nicer. Someone has taken the time to pay attention to some small details that give it a better feel, such as the look of the doors, the ""do not disturb"" signs. On the negative-the location is iffy and, if you don't know the area, seeing the homeless tents around the corner and some working ladies can be nervy, but I never felt unsafe or felt that my car was unsafe in their lot (which is gated). Just buy some pepper spray and walk with a head up attitude. The bar downstairs in the evening is ""just ok."" The comedy going on in there is less comedy, more we're pissed off about the government and don't know how to cope with our emotions (think CA entitled millennials), so no reason to listen to that drudge, even with a discount. The worst point-our air conditioning was awful. It could be we were a little extra hot due to some bar hopping, but it never did cool off in the room-and it was March, so not too hot. I meant to mention it, but got to chatting at the front desk and forgot. The bathroom is a decent size, but the counterspace is very small. I spread all my girl junk, so that sucked. The happy hour that is advertised wasn't happening that night-no reason why-just ""not tonight."" Parking is like $25. There is some street parking, but my car and things inside are valuable and I think it is worth it to not have to worry about it, so I paid it. The pool is in a strange location and not that great, so we didn't bother. No hot tub. One last thing, the main pic they have is actually not the street facing side. There is a large sign above the hotel letting you know where it is.",,,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-05-03,"Dear Guest,

mrshanna1,12,"San Diego, California",2017-04-30,FAMILY,2017-04-28,3,OK for a good price,"We visited this hotel mid week in late April.  We got what we thought was a decent deal on a nicer room, so my expectations might have been too high.  Turns out we got an average price on an average room.  The rooms are small--two queen beds, one dresser, one desk, no closet or storage space, no bathtub, no separate toilet area.  Linoleum on the floor rather than carpet was a bit off-putting, but in keeping with the boutique-like ambiance they're going for. Rooms do have a mini fridge and a microwave, so that was nice.  A/C never worked (we didn't report it because we were only in the rooms to sleep and didn't want our sleep to be interrupted by a maintenance worker).  Computers were down when we arrived, so we couldn't check in right away.  Elevator next to our room was also broken.  The mattresses were way too hard for my taste, and the ""high thread count"" sheets that were advertised were well-used and pilly (though clean).  The included breakfast was OK--serve yourself items were cold cereal, cold cuts with sliced cheese, bread items with a toaster, and a chafing dish of link sausage.  There was also an omelette bar and waffle station that was manned, but the wait was pretty long as there was only one person manning both stations.
Final word of warning--there is a $25/day charge for parking--plus tax!--that was not clearly disclosed upon check-in. Yes, as was pointed out to me on check-out, the charge was shown in the parking permit I filled out, right there in very fine print, but after traveling all day and then waiting in the lobby for the computers to come back up, I will admit that I didn't read the fine print, especially since it was never brought to my attention.  When I checked out, I had to ask for a receipt showing the final charges, so I would not have known about this charge until I received my credit card statement later on this month.  I took this as an indication that the desk staff are used to push-back on this charge, so would just assume people not know about it until after they're gone from the hotel!
All in all, Hollywood Hotel is clean,fairly safe, the employees were nice enough, and the price was right.  If you don't expect too much, you'll be fine.",,,3.0,,4.0,3.0,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-05-02,"Dear Guest,

The room was a great size, staff were brilliant, especially kitchen staff! The Wi-Fi was good but limited to how many people could go on it at a time. The views were great if you had a room looking towards the LA skyline, even on the balcony you had a great view wherever you looked. The hotel only did breakfast, there wasn't an option of dinner/tea (no reason why). The breakfast was great! The pool was nice also, was warm and clean. The hotel overall was kept in great condition. The subway was literally 2 minutes away from the hotel which is great, taking you straight to downtown LA! The area is good but can be sketchy sometimes (depending on what time you're planning on coming back). We got an uber if we knew we would be back at 11pm or just after. There was a few restaurants up the road which were nice. If you're looking for fine dining then you'd have to get the underground or uber to the nearest mall. If you're not bothered where you eat like ourselves and settle for anything, there is restaurants up the road which are great! Loved them!

Breakfast time was good always lots of food, and the fresh made waffles and omelettes add to the experience.   

The grounds around (inside hotel property) are very clean  and present to use.  Room and bathroom also clean to my expectation.  

The area outside of the hotel at night can be a bit scary, but fine during the day. Close to shops in case you forget or need anything.   

Stuff at that hotel very pleasant to deal with.

Sarah HW,29,"Cardiff, United Kingdom",2017-04-30,FAMILY,2017-04-16,5,4 night stay,"We stayed at the Hollywood hotel for 4 nights in April 2017 as a family of 6. We had 2 rooms- one was a family room with 2 x double beds which overlooked the parking lot and one was a double room with 1 x bed that overlooked the courtyard. Breakfast is included and there was something for everyone; omelettes and waffles made to order, cereals, pastries, sausage, meats and cheeses, fruit, coffees and juice. The staff were lovely and helpful. The wifi was excellent and the rooms were comfortable and clean. Previous reviews have commented on the area; there is a homeless community on the next street but this is a major city and to be expected. There are no real restaurants within walking distance but there are places to eat such as Denny's, Burger King, etc, a 5 minute drive away. The swimming pool area was lovely and clean, with towels provided and comfortable sun loungers. The hotel is close to the Griffiths Observatory and the Hollywood sign can be seen from up the street.",,,,,,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-12-18,"Dear Guest,

David C,2,,2017-04-30,FAMILY,2017-04-13,5,A perfect location for North LA,"We had a 2 night stay in this great hotel, perfectly located for Northern LA tourist attractions such as Walk Of Fame, Griffith Park & Observatory and the Hollywood sign.
I would imagine most arrive by car, and the $24 daily charge seemed a little steep but worth the money for piece of mind and ease for getting around the city. We were travelling to Universal Studios and left the hotel at 8am and arrived in the parking lot just 15 minutes (5 miles) later.
Staff such as Hugo and Sarai were incredibly friendly and helpful, with great advice for take always delivered to the hotel and getting to to Griffith Park.
Breakfast included in the rate was incredible, a range of fruit, chef made to order omelettes, toast, bagels, pastries and more, all in a lovely relaxed setting.
If I return to LA this is where we would head for.
Finally the pool area was superb, clear and towels abundant for guests and a lovely place to relax.
Finally the family room we had was ENORMOUS and was almost too big with 2 great double beds, safe, fridge, microwave, superb bathroom and TV",Room 144 was huge,,5.0,,,5.0,5.0,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-04-17,"Dear Guest,

From the entrance portal with the fountains to the star studded comedy lounge, and the egyptian cotton sheets and porche's parked outside. 

Not the case. This is a tired old motel in not the greatest area of Hollywood. The rooms are noisy and cramped and the staff are unhelpful.

It was not dirty, but we ended up staying 3 hours before we checked out and found ourselves another hotel. No refund, but rather pay for another place than spend another sleepless hour.",,1.0,2.0,,1.0,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-12-18,"Dear Guest,

Ashleigh K,7,,2017-04-30,COUPLES,2017-04-08,5,Wonderful stay,"We arrived very early on march 21st from a flight from australia. We were exhausted and Cynthia was fantastic! She managed to get us in a few hours earlier than check in to a very spacious room so we could get a good sleep. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom spacious. 
The staff couldn't have been friendlier, including the breakfast staff. 
The buffet was ample especially since it's included in the room rate. 
The location as I've read people say is in a dodgy area, but unless you are in Beverly Hills any part of LA is dodgy and you are only a ten lminute walk from the train station which takes you to all the Hollywood areas you need. 
Thanks again Hollywood hotel :)definitely would stay again.

llegault4,19,"Los Gatos, California",2017-04-30,FAMILY,2017-04-07,3,Good hotel but could use some updating,"My family enjoyed our stay at the Hollywood Hotel, We stayed for 4 nights while we explored the town. The staff was friendly, the breakfast was good, my girls loved the homemade waffles every morning but I wish they had a bigger variety of fruit. The location was great! Short driving distance to many tourist areas and super easy to get an Uber. The hotel doesn't have a restaurant (that was a little inconvenient), but they do have a variety of local restaurants  that deliver to the hotel. We order pizza and salad and the delivery was fast and the portions were huge. The reason I am giving an average rating to this hotel is because the bathroom really needs an updating, the paint was peeling off the wall, there is no storage area for your toiletries, the shower was small and by the time the 4 of us took a shower the water was cold!! The hallway carpet had a strange smell but the room was fine. My girls were disappointed that the pool was not heated (even though the hotel staff told us it was) and my husband was very frustrated that the room didn't have enough outlets for us to charge our phones and devices at night. Overall our stay was okay and we had fun exploring LA but would we stay there again? I am not sure.",,,3.0,3.0,4.0,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-12-18,"Dear Guest,

dankelly029,4,"Newcastle, Australia",2017-04-30,COUPLES,2017-04-06,4,Central Location ,"I can understand why the location of this hotel would turn someone away, but we loved our stay here. We used it as a central location and caught the Redline to LA Live/Staples Centre, Hollywood Walk of Fame and Universal Studios. At night we did Uber because its so cheap in LA ($12 to Rainbow Bar and Grill).
Normal smart traveler behaviour and you won't have an issue with getting from the hotel to the subway. There isn't much around the hotel in regards to food (Uber, again so cheap in LA!) but there is a bottle shop and laundry mat close by.
Breakfast is complementary and was the highlight of our stay. Omelettes and Waffles made fresh while you wait and they are so tasty! Hugo, you rule my omelettes man! 
Overall, this hotel definitely has a lot to offer and should be worth while considering if your doing a sightseeing tour of LA.
P.S. As for the neighbourhood thing, we quickly found out that all of LA is pretty much like that so don't let those complaints discourage your decision. 
The 4 stars was because there was no kettle or milk or tea in out room for those not wanting coffee at night.",,,,,,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-04-13,"Dear guest...

Lift was a bit slow and quicker to just to use the stairs, but did not affect our stay. All staff were polite and very helpful every time we asked for question or help. There are homeless people all over Hollywood, but we were not bothered by any on our stay. None were close by the Hotel. A great nights sleep as hotel is quiet.

It is a couple of blocks from Hollywood Walk of Fame and typical tourist places. The mattresses are dreamy. The only thing that I found wrong was that there was one tiny shelf in the shower to hold my bottles. It could have used another shelf or a bigger one. Other than that, we really enjoyed our stay. If you don't want to park on the street, the parking is 24.00 a day. We paid it, because I didn't want to leave a rental car on the street.

The only thing is that it didnt have an indoor pool but I would definitely recommend this hotel. We drove the East coast so we had a car - the hotel would be a bit out from the classic Hollywood attractions (walk of fame, main street, dolby theatre, wax museum etc) but parking nearby did not cost much - $50 a day if I can remember correctly.

An excellent buffet breakfast included in the price - I was not expecting much but the spread and array of food was spectacular. A chef was there making eggs whatever way you wanted them!

Location was good. A few minutes walk from the metro station and you could get to almost anyway from there. 
You have to pay for parking which is the only downside but then that's the norm at all the hotels in the LA area.

The location in Vermont is convenient for the area. The parking out back is secure. 

The cost is reasonable for the area.

Breakfast is provided between 6:30am and 10:30 am. On the week-end expect a long line for the omelets if you wait to 8:30. The breakfast includes juices, coffee and cereals. Leave room for sausages and potatoes. Handle is right and you could skip lunch.

The rooms have been nicely upgraded. Wood floors and nice decor. Like most hotels outlets for your electronics is limited.

The hallways are nicely improved with sconce lighting and plush carpets. The ceilings have a nice Art Deco feels.

Overall this hotel I think is the best value in the area.",,,,,,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-04-03,"Dear Guest,

Only real downside to my stay wasn't that big of a deal. Service was very polite, but not genuine.

The common areas are beautifully appointed, but the room had peeling wallpaper and paint, there were dead bugs on the less than clean floors and the furniture was not functional. Nightstand lighting was only controlled from the light switch by the door and apparently the lights are on a timer as they continually turned off after an hour or so. The air conditioner is noisy and we were unable to turn it off. After spending $200 for the night, we expected more.",,,,,,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-03-31,"Dear Guest...

Chris N,37,"Derby, United Kingdom",2017-03-31,FRIENDS,2017-03-27,5,Excellent overall hotel,"I stayed at the Hollywood Hotel with 3 friends in March 2017.
When we arrived the check-in staff were very friendly and helpful, they broke down some $100 notes for me and were happy to advise regarding the local area and local sightseeing, as none of us had visited L.A. before.
The rooms are extremely spacious and spotless and all have balconies.
The bathroom, while it could have been slightly bigger was more than fit for purpose.
Maid service was daily and efficient.  The buffet breakfast has a large selection of fresh food and they will cook to order pretty much anything you want.
The hotel does advertise its courtyard bar as being open at certain times however when we went down during this period there was no one to be seen, so it's probably worth checking with reception when this will be open if you fancy a drink in the hotel.  In any case there is a small shop directly opposite the hotel which sells beer at reasonable prices for you to take back to the room.
Location wise it is fantastic, just a 2 minute walk from the Metro station (although for such a large city this is a somewhat underdeveloped network).  We walked up to the Hollywood sign although be warned it is quite a long walk so you may want to get the Metro there too, and Universal Studios and Santa Monica are also easily reached.
Overall I would definitely recommend this hotel and stop here again.",,5.0,5.0,,5.0,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-03-28,"Dear Guest,

The room was clean and nice.
The hotel is close to the Griffith Observatory, by bus (walking 7 minutes to reach the bus station).

Stayed in room 252 near the front of the hotel , Lovely big rooms ,2 queen beds very comfy beds n pillows , good television , safe n iron n board , bathroom could be getting a makeover , bad shower couldn't move the head , had to put your back against wall to get your body under it 
 Room needs double glazing as lots of noise from main road at night , lots of traffic n sirens 
 What was special from this hotel was the breakfast , gr8 staff very nice n warm welcome , they make your eggs the way you want them 👍 top staff

I got given some gluten free bread in a plastic wrapper...it was like sponge...horrible bread and I couldn't toast it either because the toasters were a state with crumbs...Even though we had paid for breakfast everyday...we did not eat there again and had to spend more money on going out for breakfast...no refund offered for the extra we had paid for the breakfast...I complained at the desk but nothing was done to help me...very unhappy with our stay here...also the area wasn't nice...far from the beach...no where to go...lots of homeless...we didn't feel safe therefore didn't go out in the evenings!!",Ask for a room without ants!!!!!!!,,2.0,,,2.0,2.0,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-03-17,"Dear Guest,

As I walked though the front doors I was immediately met by the clean, warmly lit, and elegant atmosphere that bore us on to the front desk. Here we were greeted by Michael and Brian who were by far the most memorable and heart warming part of our stay. I truly felt from the service we received from our hosts that they were doing everything in their power, not just to make our check in smooth, and to put us at ease, while also taking the time to make sure we were fully acquainted with the amenities of the hotel including nearby transit options. Any concerns we might have had they relieved in moments and before we knew it, key in hand we were off on our way.

Roma K,11,,2017-01-31,FAMILY,2017-03-08,1,The worst hotel ever,"Booked in this hotel for 9 nights but decided to stay elsewhere for 3 nights even after paying for 9. Booked for 2 adults and 2 kids (8 and 1). The room had only 1 queen bed. We were told that this is what we booked. However, that was not the worse. The robotic receptionist Micheal (who actually behaves like America's tourism minister) at the reception told me that I was trying to 'cut corners' (his exact words) by booking for 2 people and asking for space for 4 when my booking stated 4 people. He was beyond sarcastic and he said he couldn't believe that someone would book without checking the room specifications. Pathetic way to deal with a tired customer who travelled with 2 little kids on a 11 hour flight plus 4 hours at the airport. Another receptionist Nancy was just a useless stone too. No communication or customer service skills. God knows why these kind of people decide into hospitality industry and who lets them in.

We were given a cot without a blanket. When we asked for one, we got one with holes in it (see picture). 

The walls and roof are giving up and there are huge cracks (see pictures). There was a huge pillar in the middle of the room which was annoying as my 1 year old would run into it very often. 

The bathroom sink not cleaned properly. And we never got a shower gel during our stay even though toiletries are claimed to be provided. The shower was old and rusty (see picture) and takes 2 people to pull it out and work.

Water ran out twice and once when my kids were in shower. Even when we were checking out, an angry lady was standing at reception complaining about no water in the bathroom. 

The wifi doesn't work inside the room at least not inside our room. We had to go outside and got some signal some day if we were lucky.

On a positive note, they do serve amazing breakfast. The chef Jose makes wonderful on demand omlettes. The lady Lupe was also cheerful and bubbly. Honestly, that was the only positive experience we had in this hotel.",,,,,,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-09-22,"Dear Guest,

When looking at the website this looked like a kewl place.  It needs a full on LA face lift!! The place is old, run down, not what the website portrayed.

I would not recommend this Hotel.  Spend your money elsewhere, where the staff is concerned about the safety of their guests!

stephaniewoolsey,158,"San Jose, California",2017-02-28,COUPLES,2017-03-01,4,"Decent hotel, good location","Yes, parking is expensive here. But you have to pay to park everywhere in LA. You are allowed to come and go in the parking lot, so at least you only pay once per day. We booked directly through the hotel to get a better rate than from third party sites - sounds from the reviews here like rates can really vary. Our 2 queen bed room was normal US hotel sized, included small microwave and refrigerator, coffee pot and coffee. Bathroom was on the smaller side, and did need some work (chipped paint, some rust in the ceiling of the shower, etc.). We also had a balcony but the weather was too cold and wet to use it during our stay. Shower pressure itself was good. Heater was loud and we could hear the neighbors' heater when it was left running.

Inner hallways are wide and courtyards on various floors are nice places to sit outside. Yes, most of the photos of the hotel are from the parking lot, but once we checked in, since we had a rental car, it's the view we saw every time we came back to our room. And it's a beautiful entrance!

Pros for us: stairs easily accessible (we aren't fans of elevators) both up to our room and down to breakfast, loved the international guests that we saw each day at breakfast. Large parking lot, easy access from parking lot to hotel.

Neutral: Hotel breakfast was cooked-to-order omelets, eggs, and waffles (plain or different daily specials), also cold cereals, bagels, muffins and seasonal fruits. Food quality was ok, but nothing fancy. We stayed four nights, and went out to a restaurant for breakfast the last day for a change of pace.

Con (for me): all pillows were soft down (or down-type; I didn't ask) and when I asked for a more firm pillow the ones they sent up were still pretty squishy. Bed was a bit firm for my liking. Room temp was on the cold side, and as mentioned above, the heater was loud (and not very efficient). Pool is across the parking lot from the hotel.
 
Side note: We were also at the hotel during the power outage, which only lasted one night - probably about 24 hours total. It wasn't the fault of the hotel (outage covered several blocks around the hotel), and they did a good job of providing glow sticks on the stair railings. Breakfast the next morning was obviously not cooked items, but they brought up the cold items to the lobby. It would have been nice if they had comped us something, like a meal or room discount, etc. but when my husband asked for a discount if we stayed the next night (assuming there would be no power, but it did end up coming back on before night), they said they would let us leave (rather than charging us for the night). No special deal. Not the best customer service in this regard, but I get the feeling this was not a normal occurrence.

I would probably stay here again, but would try to not rent a car so I wouldn't have to pay the parking rates on top of the hotel charges and taxes, etc.",Rooms facing the parking lot or side street are more quiet.,,3.0,3.0,,,4.0,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-03-07,"Dear Guest,

We had a quiet room on the side street.  Large room with microwave, coffee machine and very comfortable bed.  The hotel is located near the metro station for easy access to downtown and Hollywood Boulevard area.  We used it to pick up the bus tour outside The Dolby.   On the downside, the toiletries were not replaced in our room at all during our stay.

TooTrue,166,"Perth, Australia",2017-02-28,NONE,2017-02-14,5,Loved it,"The reception was absolutely professional with the well spoken gentleman absolutely the best we met in the US. The actual beautiful facade (nostalgia) is actually the back of the hotel in the private large car park, obviously for the era of ball room entrances. The pool is fantastic not that we went in as it was 4 days of downpours. The centre garden was beautiful but again the rain closed it down, which was a shame as dying to lounge around in such a pretty place. The rooms are large and very clean, the cleaning staff friendly and committed. Agree with other reviewers in that the breakfast is pretty good, but the two cooks not pleasant, and as for Igor the table cleaner, he could show Singapore Food Hall cleaners how to maximise the noise in throwing plates into the tub, and scowling and pointing at items on the table( the only unpleasant thing about the hotel). However the catering staff uniforms were absolutely spotless and well turned out, which seemed so at odds with their grim attitudes. Hotel very convenient to Subway, and the list of restaurant they provide are not only excellent but within walking distance. A top hotel though, and still tarted up like the lady she used to be. They have spent a lot of money modernising but in keeping it traditional to probably one of the best in her day.",,,,,,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-02-17,"Dear Guest,

CosDvt,95,"Istanbul, Turkey",2017-01-31,COUPLES,2017-01-29,4,Great location,"The location of the hotel was just perfect for coming in Los Angeles in winter, and we paid arround 1500 USD (taxes included)for 12 nights, the price was fair too. 
The hotel is clean and quiet in general (depends of the fellow travelers) and they have very nice terraces and garden and the pool looks amazing too. It's not a luxurious hotel but a low cost awesome place to feel the spirit of L.A., if you are lucky to catch a good offer .
The staff is super friendly and attentive and i really mean it, from the Filipino parking lady to the handyman, they are all smiling and helpful. Special thanks (gracias) to Gisel, she is amazing! I will definetly miss the breakfast omlets made by Hugo and Julio, also their pancakes.

The most disturbing thing is the price of the parking: 24 usd /day + sales tax!!! Yes, there is the comfort of a safe parking but 24 USD a day plus taxes for a customer of the hotel i think it's too much (even you can find to rent a car at cheaper rate a day but you pay more for the parking) at least they should make a discount depending on the days staying at the hotel, for us, the total cost of the parking was 315 USD.

 Also, i payed 30 USD for washing a shirt, sweatshirt, pants and socks. About other payments, every online order you make to receive at the hotel costs 4 USD.",,,,,,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-01-31,"Dear Guest,

The parking situation was great for our rental car because we could come and go as we please, and not have to wait for valet and have to constantly be tipping the valet service. The price along with the geo. location (although the neighbourhood is not the nicest) and the convenience of parking is what sold this hotel. Even though parking was $25 a day, they offer free breakfast here, which is a huge savings and convenience and made everything worth it. Infact i was very impressed with the breakfasts, there were lots of choices and the food was good. 
Staff pros and cons: Everyone was friendly and nice. We requested extra pillows and blankets which we got. (took a little persuasion). When we would hang up the sign on door to not disturb or come in when we were out for the day, they would enter anyway and half clean our room. And when we requested a wake-up call it never came in the morning. 
Room quality: outdated with dirty wallpaper and dirty/mouldy corners of bathroom and rusted towel racks. The rest of room was clean. The bed was hard, but the pillows were the best of any hotel I've stayed in! The view over the courtyard was nice! 
With this being said, i was expecting what i got, and was well prepared by other reviews i read. I chose to pay for a cheaper hotel where i spent little time other than to sleep, while i splurged on events, car rental and shopping!",request courtyard view,4.0,3.0,,,,3.0,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-01-30,"Dear Guest,

The inclusive breakfast buffet (plus omelette and waffle station) is one of the best we've enjoyed. The rooms are spacious, but lacking in character. The bed was only OK, and the pillows were not comfortable. The bathroom fittings were weary, and in parts filler had been badly applied to crumbling tiling/woodwork. In terms of value ....... it is not the cheapest hotel in Hollywood. But it certainly is not the most expensive. To say it is close to Universal Studios is a bit of a stretch. But the metro service is close by, and in 45 minutes we were in the park. It is not in the heart of Hollywood. But that would cost more!",,,,,,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-12-18,"Dear Guest,

Fred R,39,"Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park, United Kingdom",2016-11-30,FRIENDS,2017-01-03,4,Decent Hotel,"The Hollywood Hotel is located within walking distance of the Hollywood walk of fame and also has two metro stations close by. 
The reception area was clean, tidy and comfortable. Although checking in took some time, the staff were very friendly, professional and polite. 

My room was a decent size with a double bed, air conditioning, coffee machine, flat screen TV, microwave, ironing board and free wifi. Everything you could have needed. 
The ensuite bathroom was an ok, but maybe could have done with a bit of an update

Breakfast was excellent. There was a huge buffet as well as freshly made omelettes and waffles. The breakfast staff were all very friendly and happy to help. 

However there are a couple of let downs. First of all, there is no restaurant and the bar doesn't offer food of any kind.
 On my first night, after following signs for the restaurant, I arrived in the bar downstairs. I asked the man behind the bar where the restaurant is, he just replied ""well, they say they have a restaurant, but the actually don't"" then he walked away to serve a customer. Helpful! 
I then asked if there is anywhere I could go to get something to eat close to the hotel. After taking a huge bite of the cheese burger he was holding in one hand, he recommended a few places close by. 
I then left. As I was leaving I heard him shouting across the bar something about getting a member of staff deported back to Mexico!
I think he just thought he was funny. What a shame. 

Another problem with the hotel not offering any food in the evenings is that you have to venture out at night to find somewhere to eat. I didn't feel safe in this area after dark, especially on my own. The streets where very dimly lit and stink of urine. There were homeless people sprawled over the sidewalk, shouting all kinds of profanities as people walked past.  

Overall, this is a very nice hotel. The staff are friendly, helpful, professional and polite (with the exception of the bar staff). Also my room was comfortable and had everything you could have needed. 
What a shame about the bar. It felt like a different establishment all together.",,4.0,4.0,,,3.0,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-01-09,"Dear guest...

GPHX2016,6,"Phoenix, Arizona",2016-07-31,FAMILY,2016-12-31,5,A great spot!,"Was here for a family vacation in July.  The hotel is a little older but it's been kept up well over the years and is very modernized overall.  The restaurant and bar are great, everyone there is very friendly and the desk service is great.  There is an excellent complimentary breakfast each morning with an omelet station and everything.  Nice little fitness center there as well, I always look for that in a hotel.  This place has a lot of history and the location, while in a somewhat funky neighborhood, is very central if you want to be right in the middle of things in Hollywood.  This place has ambience and isn't just a generic place to stay.  You can walk right out to a number of restaurants and bars which are right in the neighborhood.  I'd like to make special mention of Maria Perez, a very helpful and friendly member of the housekeeping staff.  I would like to stay here again someday.  If you're looking for something different, and you want to be right in Hollywood, this is the place.  It's also very close to the Burbank airport, just a short ride away so you can fly into Burbank and skip LAX completely.",,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-01-02,"Dear Guest,

ImaHappyTraveler702,69,"Las Vegas, Nevada",2016-12-31,FAMILY,2016-12-31,5,Nice and comfortable,"Our stay was great.  Beds were comfortable, rooms were spacious, breakfast was great, lay out of hotel, secure parking was good and staff was pleasant. 
Bad side - parking for check in a lititle tough.  The driveway is one way, so if a car is in the middle, that car can't move, until the front car leaves.  Elevators are SLOW & bottom floor where breakfast is is stuffy.
Because of our schedule, we didn't get to experience the welcoming patio, but from pictures looked inviting.

Steven T,5,"Houston, Texas",2016-12-31,NONE,2016-12-30,5,Near Hollywood and Highly Recommend,"Stayed here for two nights around Christmas time and have nothing but great things to say about this place. First, our room was clean and spotless. The staff was very helpful in providing necessary assistance as well as the hospitality not often seen today. The complimentary daily breakfast was also excellent particularly during our 2-night stay there.. If you are planning to visit the Sunset Strip and/or go to Universal Studios, staying here would especially be convenient for you.

I highly recommend. Great hotel for a relatively affordable price.",,,,,,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-01-02,"Dear Guest...

Weeting01,35,"Singapore, Singapore",2016-12-31,FAMILY,2016-12-28,2,Newly renovated but old furnishing,"The receptionist was courteous and friendly. Although we did not have the 2 rooms nearby, she assured us that the rooms are beautiful. Indeed, the rooms were spacious and one of the room has a balcony that oversee the courtyard. I was impressed. 

There is a huge gated carpark right beside the hotel but chargeable at $24 per day. There was sauna but restricted to aged 15 and above. There was laundry but much more expensive than elsewhere( $3.50 to wash and $3.50 to dry) 

The breakfast was just so-so. The chef at the omelette station was rude and refused the egg orders for my kids. He insisted that I had to pay for breakfast for my kids as each room only cover breakfast for 2 adults, but when we checked with the reception after our breakfast, the receptionist told us that kids could eat for free.  (I think the chef was frustrated as they were short handed that day, cos the next day, they had 2 chefs and both of them were much more polite). The servers in the cafe were rude as well. He seems frustrated when clearing the plates impatiently and loudly. 

Although the rooms were recently renovated, the furnishing was old. The sink in my bathroom had a huge crack, the switches in the rooms were yellowish with rusty screws, the safebox in the rooms was faulty, the phone in the room was faulty too. There were holes and black specks on the wall likely from the previous nail removed. 

The rooms had tiled flooring instead of carpet. Thus, I could see clearly that the flooring under the bed and side tables hasn't been cleaned for a while. 

My room has a bathtub but not the other room, which only had a small shower area laid with tiles which was slippery (despite with a non slip mat). Fortunately my mum only had a knock on her arm when she slipped. 

We had indicated on the door tag, that we did not want to be disturbed. However, our rooms were being cleaned up in our absence, and our pajamas placed on the dirty looking sofa. 

Despite the unpleasant stay, two things I liked about the stay was the scent of the toiletries provided and secondly, the bed was big and comfortable.

The rooms were fairly clean, we were on the second floor, on the back side, so quite quiet. Staff was friendly and helpful. Breakfast great!

But, a huge negative part of our trip was the neighborhood this hotel is located in. There is no restaurant in the hotel, so you must leave the hotel in the evening to eat... of our 4 nights, there was not one time that we were not followed, whistled at, yelled at, sneered at by locals. It was awful. We made the mistake of taking the subway, it was scary, sketchy and awful. We did not feel safe while staying here and dreaded coming and going. 

We ended up blowing most of our budget on having a trusted cab driver pick us up and drop us off, just so we could have some peace of mind. Would not recomend.",,,3.0,,,3.0,3.0,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-09-25,"Dear Jessica

maxim27091960,1,,2016-12-31,FAMILY,2016-12-23,5,Overall impression with some details,"We were greeted by the man at the desk named Bryan. He was quite friendly and professional with us. There was no tention, no nothing negative from Bryan's side. Today, December 23rd we went down for the breakfast. The food, the service has all been great. We, as a family, do firmly believe that people who work in any particular place actually make the place. In case with breakfast in Hollywood Hotel we've felt that this type of people were José and Juan, very friendly people, who are very much meant to be in a position that they are both in. People like José and Juan are capable of enhancing any public place that has to deal with qualified serving the people. There is a moto: ""Of the people, by the people and for the people"". These two guys,José and Juan, are both one of the embodiments of the mentioned particular moto. 
So all in all we say thank you very much on behalf of our family to the Hollywood Hotel!

MrsM1985,30,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",2016-11-30,COUPLES,2016-12-23,3,"An ok hotel, location less than ideal","Stayed here with my husband on the second leg of our U.S. trip. We had been told by a travel agent that LA has no high or low season - it's hella expensive all year round. We stayed for 4 nights with a budget of around £100 per night and struggled to find somewhere in one of the hotspots. So, we looked at the places we wanted to see and found that they were mostly around the Hollywood area, and chose this hotel based on location and price. When we arrived we immediately regretted this decision - it is right on the main road, so it was noisy day and night. That said, I had requested a room near a lift which was granted, and we were given a room round the side which apparently would be quieter - it was still noisy. We thought the location would look better in the daylight since we arrived in darkness - it didn't. I was concerned about security as it would have been possible for anyone to walk in off the street and access guest room doors, and although nothing happened during our stay it is worth noting if you're travelling alone, or are vulnerable. 

Check in was smooth and uneventful, and we were given a booklet of takeaway menus 'in case we were tired of walking around all day'... we discovered that this was likely given out because there are literally no restaurants nearby. Nothing to do in the evening in the area. Note: if you want to order, they won't take cash and you have to register online. We use pre-paid credit cards abroad, the site didn't accept them and so we couldn't order in. There is a retail park about 3 mins walk away, where we ate every night of our stay - not the best but there is a subway, Pizza Hut, a noodle type place and a Chinese fast food outlet. 

Neighbourhood slightly dicey, we didn't want to go out after dark. Wifi included but was temperamental and sloooooow. However, if you're ok using public transport, the Hollywood & Highland stop (for the walk of fame, Chinese theatre, and hop on/off buses start point) are about 4 stops on the subway train from the hotel (roughly 10 minute journey) and its cheap to use ($1.75 one way, per person). So it's well located for sightseeing, but not for meandering of an evening in our opinion. One thing worth noting: LA is massive. If you look on google maps and think A to B is walkable, it won't be - the avenues go on forever, make use of your preferred method of transport, as long as it isn't your feet! To give you an idea, it took about 2 hours to get from LAX to our hotel, and we were the second stop on a shared transfer. 

The room we were allocated was fairly large, with a king sized bed, fridge, tv and phone. The bathroom was clean enough but not spotless - by that I mean the shower head was riddled with limescale, grouting was dirty and the sink area could have done with a scrub. Nothing to complain about though, this is general hotel ageing. The A/C was very noisy and I was told that this is normal for the hotel - we didn't use it while in the room. Housekeeping came daily to tidy up and make the bed, coffee was replaced if we used it. 

Breakfast was included in the stay which was gratefully received. A good selection and fresh. Omelettes and waffles were made to order (at a station) and served with smiles from the team. No variation but for 4 days this was fine. 

We hired a car to leave LA and parked in the hotels car park on our last evening there. The vehicle was on the premises for less than 12 hours, but we were still charged the full rate, which I found a little unfair. Parking on the street after a certain time is free (I don't remember the specifics) but since it was a hired car and a busy street, I didn't want to take the chance of any damage occurring. If it was my own vehicle I would have parked on the street and saved $26!!

The one thing I did like about this hotel was the staff. They were happy to help with any queries or issues, and knew all about the attractions we asked them about, and the public transport links. They were smiley and pleasant, every staff member we encountered clearly cared about the hotel and valued their employment there. 

If I were to return to LA I wouldn't stay here, partly because of the location, partly because I'd like a nicer hotel to stay in. If you aren't fussy about where your hotel is, and only want a place to sleep, this would be a good bet for wallet friendly, clean lodgings. If you like a nice area to explore should you want to hang out near the hotel, avoid this one. ",,,,,,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-10-24,"Dear Guest,

Pooven G,4,,2016-12-31,FAMILY,2016-12-18,4,"Great hotel, location a bit dicy","Stayed there on our last leg of our US vacation. Reception staff were great (Nancy and Eli). The complimentary breakfast was excellent but as it is the same stuff everyday got a bit boring so opted out after a few days
The location is just about on the border of the wrong end of Hollywood so would not advise you going down the road at night for takeaways. However walking west was not bad but some places were closed after 8.30pm. If you have a car then you have no worries but we relied on ubering everywhere. 
They do not provide room service which is a shame - considering the neighborhood at night some basice pizza and toasted sandwiches would be a very welcome addition to their service
The litle gym was clean and was well equiped with clean towels and some refreshing iced drinks
Overall in terms of the price and the great attitude of staff we felt very welcomeand I would definitely stay here again","As far away from the car park, road and gift shop",,5.0,,3.0,4.0,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-10-24,"Dear Guest

Made a last minute booking through third party vendor - great deal but it was about location.  I rushed from the east coast without checking for confirmation.  Got there and there was no record of reservations and I was not the only one with the same problem.  Three other parties in lobby having similar issues. Staff had Zero sympathy. Sneering attitude about people looking for deals. ""we get a lot of those kinds of people.""  Give me your credit card and we can charge you full price until other comes through.  Right - quite a scam. He actually told me he would not rent me a room even if he had one - his colleague told me they had one.  It's a crappy neighborhood on top it but I was looking for convenience to hospital.  In 60 years of traveling I have never been so insulted by anyone.

Check in was pleasant with the helpful guy at reception giving us some tips about the area and the hotel,our rooms were on the ground floor and in an easy to access location.Parking is at the rear via a security gate,bags can either be taken from the car park or directly from reception,trolleys are available.
 The rooms were all reasonable size,clean and comfortable and included fridge,microwave,coffee machine and TV, the wifi worked but not particularly well.Bathroom was clean with shower/bath and plenty of hot water. Our room had air con however it was noisy so we didn't use it all that often.House keeping was excellent we hardly saw them as we were out all day,but the rooms were always made up with fresh sheets and towels and coffee etc on our return.
 A large swimming pool is located outside adjacent to the car park it looked lovely and clean however it wasn't heated so no one was using it.In warmer weather it would be great.
 The area around the hotel was a bit seedy particularly at night,about 200 mtrs to the  left of reception is a small shopping centre where a supermarket and various take away food places operate,we found this to be handy and used it a couple of times.The included breakfast area is below reception and opens at 6.30am each day two cooks are on hand making omelettes and waffles to order as well as cold meats, cheese,cereal,yoghurt and the usual array of hot and cold drinks etc. We always had  a good experience with breakfast and can definitely recommend the hotel to any one considering it.",Ground floor beside courtyard.,,5.0,,,4.0,5.0,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-10-24,"Dear Guest,

Bronte S,1,,2016-12-31,SOLO,2016-12-11,1,DO NOT STAY HERE IF YOU VALUE YOUR PRIVACY AND BELONGINGS!!,"Was having a perfectly fine (albeit noisy) stay at this hotel, until the last night! I woke up at about 2pm due to jetlag, and not having many hours of daylight yet was in a rush to get out the door. In getting ready I left a few bits and pieces, clothes, hairbrush etc on the bed and in my rush, not wanting to take my ring out with me, took it off and left it on the bed. I don't like housekeeping to come if I've left the room untidy- mostly because I don't want to make extra work but also because I am paranoid about things going missing, so I left the do not disturb sign on the door. Well, I get back in the evening and housekeeping has completely disregarded the sign on the door, and let themselves in, and MY RING IS GONE! 
Now I'm not saying the staff have sticking fingers, most likely have scooped up the sheets with the ring on top, but THAT IS EXACTLY WHY I LEFT THE DO NOT DISTURB SIGN ON THE DOOR! Don't disturb my stuff!!! Complete lack of respect for privacy and peoples belongings. As this ring had great sentimental value I was very upset, and tore the room upside down TWICE hoping it would show up or have fallen on the floor , but after looking for an hour through the small room I went to the front desk to explain the situation. Girl behind the counter was absolutely useless, offered no help and just said that the housekeeping finish at 3, the laundry is locked and the only person who has access to it is the manager who doesn't come in till 6:30 in the morning. My airport pickup is at 6:35.
Excellent. So now instead of a relaxing last night to end a great trip in LA I'm missing a really special ring and am completely shattered. Wishing I had never chosen this hotel, now feel like a hostel would have been more secure! 

Working as a flight attendant and travelling often, I have never stayed in a hotel that will come into your room if the do not disturb sign is up. 

As I said, don't stay here if you value your privacy or things, as the do not disturb sign obviously means nothing at this sad excuse for a hotel!!!

The front staff couldn't have been any more helpful or pleasant. We really appreciated their help a few times. Our room 326 was great - very quiet and nicely appointed. The only drawback was the hot water in the bathroom was a bit hit and miss. We did notify the front desk of this but it wasn't fixed. But if that was our only problem we were lucky. The hotel is close to a small shopping mall and supermarket. Transport isn't far away. The buffet breakfast was nice but we probably would have enjoyed bacon and eggs. The only egg dishes they did were omelettes or scrambled eggs, However it was still enjoyable. The chefs behind the bain marie were very friendly as was everyone we met at the hotel - from the cleaners, to the maintenance crew to the front desk. We would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in LA. It isn't in Hollywood itself but the metro is close by and you can take the train to Hollywood & Highland and it brings you right out next to Graumann's Chinese Theatre so you can walk along the Hollywood Strip and see the sights (of which there are many!).",,,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2016-12-09,"Dear Guest...

MarathonManMelbourne,41,"Melbourne, Australia",2016-11-30,COUPLES,2016-12-07,4,Good Location,"Hotel was clean and housekeeping did a good job in the rooms. Found reception staff a bit hit & miss. Check in was not very friendly & did not explain hotel facilities. After a 16 hour flight a smile would have been nice. On other days reception staff were welcoming and provided tips on places to eat locally. 
Pool is outdoors and slightly away from the actual hotel. Access through car park. Breakfast was average. Layout was odd. You were criss crossing the area and other guests to get things. Ie: plates for toast on left side of room toasters on right. Toasters were only 4 slices not the normal industrial belt drive so we all had to wait for each other’s toast to pop. 
Hotel has a deal with a taxi/hirer car company. $65.00 US flat rate to LAX Air Port. Good rate but the taxi drivers are very questionable. We got pulled over by off duty cop for speeding and the driver told him we had asked for him to speed. We had 6 hours before our flight so we were not in any hurry. No tip for him. 
As we don’t mind a good walk the Hollywood hills are not too far away & we highly recommend the view from the very top. Full day 14km round trip. Do in the dry as the trails are all gravel/dirt.
Hollywood walk of stars and Chinees Theatre also not too far away around 4km and plenty to see before you get there.

Mike T,6,,2016-04-30,COUPLES,2016-12-05,5,Luxury hotel but at the mid range price,"The location of the hotel is very strategic especially for tourist as there are transportation within the vicinity like subway and bus, restaurants, convenient store and gasoline station.

They also have parking lot and car rental service which is very convenient especially for those who don't want to travel far just to rent a car.

The only downside is the food that they offer during breakfast which is very redundant every day which for us we have to go out the hotel and eat somewhere and the parking lady who is very rude whenever she asked for the parking ticket and we are not the only one complaining about her.

Overall, during our seven day stay at the hotel for our honeymoon, we enjoy it so much that the next time we will be in LA we will definitely book this hotel again.",Any floor will do,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2016-12-09,"Dear Guest,

It is difficult and sometimes impossible to do work on their slow internet. I stayed three nights and had to use it at most times of the day and evening. You get better wifi at a DayInn for gods sake. In addition, their bar was not open yet their sign said it was open every night. In fairness, it also said hours may change without notice. As a result I had to take my business meeting to a local dive down the street. I will not be staying here again.

markyg362,3,"Mississauga, Canada",2016-11-30,COUPLES,2016-12-01,3,"Convenient location, good breakfast, traffic noise","This hotel is clean, the rooms spacious, and the front desk helpful. Despite the name, it is NOT in Hollywood itself. But it is only a 5 min. walk to the Metro (subway) station, which is four stops from central Hollywood, five from Universal Studios, and about a twenty-five min. train ride to/from downtown L.A. The locale is not at all upscale, with homelessness evident in the area. But we were not uncomfortable walking about, and there are some decent eateries for basic dining, and an Ecuadorean tavern across the street.. The hotel will offer you a menu for room delivery from some more sophisticated restaurants, but the apparently reasonable prices get grossly inflated by taxes and extra charges. Ripoff!
The charming picture shown above is from the rear, where you will arrive and park, if you arrive by car. Otherwise, the front entrance is much more pedestrian. A little large for a true boutique hotel, it is a rectangular structure with an open centre court - a quite lovely area for sitting or reading. Because the hotel is located on a busy street and very close to a second, there is a lot of late and early traffic noise. REQUEST A ROOM FACING THE INSIDE COURT! We were in a side outer room, and it was very noisy. I purchased ear plugs, but still had difficulty sleeping. Requested a room change but they were fully booked.
The free internet connection was not at all straightforward, and frustrating. I finally got online with the help of the hotel's IT staff.
We greatly appreciated the included hot and cold self-serve buffet breakfast, with its omelette station and chef! An unexpected bonus in a mid-tier hotel like this. There was a small fitness room and an outside unheated swimming pool which we did not use, but it looked clean and well-maintained.
The Hollywood Hotel can offer good value, depending on the rate you get, but I would never book this hotel again without the assurance of an inside room.",Get an inside room! Outer rooms on the front or sides are noisy.,,5.0,,3.0,4.0,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2016-12-05,"Dear Guest,

Then the first room we had was old, dirty and tired. We thought about walking out but the hotel was full and really busy. So we asked to change, 2nd room was a lot better, they had clearly done some work on the room, but still not 4 star. B'fast was nice, whole hotel was very busy and everyone else likes it so it might have just been our standards. There are no restaurants or shops in walking distance, parking good but traveling places was a nightmare and then you have to pay to park, everywhere.

Happy12Times,101,"Camden, Australia",2016-11-30,FAMILY,2016-11-18,4,Nice Hotel,"First impressions  well presented clean hotel. Stayed from the 7th to the 11th of November 16 and had room 244 on the 2nd floor which was a nice big room. Best thing about breakfast was your omelette,fried eggs or scrambled eggs cooked for you, very yummy. This tip is for the ladies allow enough time to get ready if you are going to wash your hair as the water pressure is not the best and the hairdryer is not very powerful.
I had never been to LA before and I was a bit disappointed the area is not what I imagined, where the hotel is it's only 5 minutes to catch a train or a bus which was very convenient. We went to Universal Studios for 2 days it's really easy to get there maybe 4 stops on the train then a little walk to catch the shuttle bus up, but if you feel fit you can walk the really steep hill, all up maybe 45 minutes. We also went to the walk of fame also only about 4 stops on the train.

The room was very nice, it had 2 queen size beds as promised, and had a small fridge and coffee maker, which was very convenient. Breakfast in the hotel was good and we really enjoyed the omelets and waffles by Mr. Hugo Jose and Juan at the buffet. My husband and kids are really picky eaters so we appreciated their service very much. My only feedback about the buffet is that I would have liked to find a little bit more fruit variety, but besides that everything was great for us.

TA-Photographer,327,"Kingston-upon-Hull, United Kingdom",2016-11-30,FRIENDS,2016-11-14,4,Needs a few minors details changing,"one very long honest review first of i must state the main rooms are perfect for all with zero issues

The hotel hollywood on north vermont, a lovely litle hotel with many good things going for it but a few bads things that really let it down

so the good and bad of all.

hugos complimentery breakfast is perfect to start the day hugo makes wonderfull pancakes and omeletes and there is a varied choice to suit everyone from pancakes and maple syrup to all kinds of cereals a good selection over all.

bad points only 1 of the 3 toasters at breakfast work correctly and the black cups for coffee are chipped and therefore not good for the bacteria conscouis out there.

cleaning of the rooms and hotel is good overall

bad point the do not disturb sign has small print allowing cleaners access bettween 3 and 11 weather the sign is out or not so annoyingly for some your room is not always as private as you want or expect it to be. (i advise taking your own do not disturb sign without small print as under california law the room is classed as private property once rented)

basic maintenience needs a little pulling together
the balconys are worn and outdated (nothing a lick of paint and a bit of filler wouldnt fix also the broken trelliceing screwed to the balconys should be removed and replaced throughout (we tryed 2 rooms in the hotel both updated

the rooms are perfect no more needs to be said and the extras are perfect
the bathrooms need a little updatig and some tiles replacing throughout all the rooms it seems (again seems like maintenence is a bit slow to catch up to the basic fix problems.

the staff

good people jessica the receptionist is very helpfull and a credit to there business there night staff are the same and have a good sense of humour

the smoking area

not good the smoking area happens to be where the cars drive up the front ramp
clearly the hotelier is not a smoker and has no clue that providing a decent smoking area with a few chairs would stop the clients of which i saw many smoking off there balconys. not only is it smoggy for the smokers but dangerous when cars are passing threw. an area out back with a few chairs would surfice but this seems to be lacking and therefore would deter smokers of which at least 70 percent there at the time where, from repeating there visit in the future. also the currant set up means non smokers leaving the hotel must pass through the smoggy smokers outside.

the overall service and staffing of the hotel is extreamly good it just seems the managers who are never seen (well the mother is shes head of housekeeping but the son hides in back) are out of touch with what there clients want.

the saunas and computer area are good and free, same as the gym

the pool is unheated but i have been informed solar paneling is being fitted to heat the pool and this is a good move forward.

the phone system has a mind of its own i think they have the phones setup wrong as i tried the wakeup number on 2 phones and got tech support.

we dont advise you use there pizza company mamas pappas as its like a doughy english pizza instead ring the very local raffallos pizza 323-660-8506 they do an outstanding italian pizza and deliver faster but they seem to have some weird reason to push the cheaper nastier company for some reason which seems odd

parking is not offered free like most local hotels (which is odd as the car park is virtually empty all the time) this should really be free for paying guests and charged for non paying visitors during the lower seasons. i advise not driving and using the metro as you can access virtually anywhere in la in around 15 mins from the metro opposite the hotel.

so recap the rooms and hotel are worth the stay just look out for the above as these are the few bad points the hotel has.

location can be iffy a lot of homeless sleeping outside the hotel and up and down the street outside although the hotel cannot do anything about this it is important you know this in advance. and do not carry any valubles in plain sight when exploring locally but dont let this put you off

we have added 95 pictures all in hd so images can be downloaded and zoomed into

again one of our indepth reviews with pictures hopefully when i revisit the hotel most of these minor points will have been fixed.",always a front balcony,,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-10-31,"Dear Guest,

idsd,28,United Kingdom,2016-10-31,NONE,2016-11-11,3,Stayed at better,"We booked this hotel based on reviews from other reports, and we are by no means snobby and are well seasoned travellers, but this hotel failed us in every way.

The rooms were clean but very small with one queen size bed (in all the hotels we’ve stayed in in the US the rooms have been massive with king size beds).  That we could cope with but there was nowhere to put anything.  A couple of bedside drawers and a wheeled clothes horse that looked like it came from a clothing shop shoved into a corner was just not sufficient.

The hotel dates from about 1929 and looks it.  The manager said that all the rooms had been upgraded and when I expressed my dismay due to the rusting towel shelf, the peeling toilet seat, the cracked tiles in the bath, the peeling wallpaper and the mildew in the sealant around the bath, she didn't reply!!

We were so unhappy we felt compelled to complain and were shown some other rooms but sadly they were exactly the same as the ones we were already in, so not a great help.  

They are currently updating rooms – apparently one at a time - but they are extending them by losing the balconies.  It's only a couple of feet and makes you wonder if it's worth it!

The hotel does have a pool (with pool towels provided) which is quite nicely set upbut it’s not heated!!
The hotel advertised a complimentary Drinks and Appetizers in the Courtyard between 5pm and 7pm but in the week we were there it didn’t happen.

This hotel does provide breakfast and it's not a bad set up and there is plenary of choice but sadly it can't cope with the amount of people staying there.  The 'egg station' had 1 chef most of the time and he would do fried, scrambled or omelet’s but he also did pancakes and waffles so the queues got quite long.  Most infuriating was that as there were not enough tables and 1 person would often sit at a table for 4, leaving no where for a groups of 3 or 4 to sit together.  They did have proper toasters (not those rotating grill things that take half an hour to toast bread and it comes out whiter than it went in) five in all that could each take four slices but one didn't work and they still put it out every day!!!

My pet hate in hotels (and it's a personal thing, probably because I'm 6'4"") is that I hate fixed shower heads and this had one that and was set for 6' people !!!Small bath towels which were not very soft but maybe I'm just being picky.

The rooms had coffee machines.  They supply sachets of coffee and cream but they only had Earl Grey tea.  There's also a fridge and microwave, no minibar.

Wi-fi very hit and miss and a strange way to log on.  You seem to have to log onto a signal nearest your room, so if you’re in the bedroom, you'll log on to a signal but if you go into the bathroom, you'll lose it and have to try and log on elsewhere.  Even when we did get a connection, it was extremely slow!

We had a hire car (you have to pay for parking) but there is a metro just down the road.  The hotel is in quite a good location to get to most touristy things but the area is not particularly nice with many homeless people in the surrounding streets (although they don’t bother you).  Wouldn't want to stay here with having a car

I think hotels like these are more geared towards businessmen staying the odd night or two, not so much holiday makers staying for a fortnight.  However it did us for the 7 nights we were there. Certainly wouldn't stay at this hotel again, but then probably wouldn't come back to LA",,,,,,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2016-11-14,"Dear guest...

It is close to the Subway and there is a bus stop right out the front of the hotel. There are a few restaurants within walking distance.

The room is very nice, it has a mini fridge, safe, and is quite spacious and roomy for two adults and two children. There are also Laundry facilities on property a pool and a gym.

It is in Hollywood but the area is not good,we didn't venture out at night but I'm sure if you had a car you would be fine. The saving grace was the Metro line which is one block away which we used to travel all over LA,it's $7 a day which took us to Santa Monica,Long Beach,Universal,Hollywood etc,it's clean and we felt safe during the day.
The hotel room was adequate for us,microwave,coffee machine and fridge provided,bed comfy,bathroom shower with small bath. Rooms are rather tired and could do with updating. Breakfast provided which was OK,sausage and hash browns everyday and an egg station,no bacon!!! Staff always polite and helpful. Pool area quaint,pool in need of a clean and I was bitten by something while sunbathing. This is a budget hotel so really you get what you pay for,many of its guest like to party so you may get woken up at 3am which happened to us on a couple of occasions. If you are flying in from LAX avoid SuperShuttle which although $17 per person took over an hour to reach the hotel which after a 11hour flight not good. Easy way back from the hotel,Metro to Union Station$1.75 then the LAX flyaway $9 take approx 30mins.",Pool view or middle section as Vermont Avenue very busy,3.0,4.0,,3.0,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2016-11-14,"Dear Guest,

They made me feel at home straight away. The rooms were nothing fancy, but good value. Location is great - very close to metro station, supermarket, tourist spots like Hollywood Forever Cemetery etc. As a solo traveller, I was really grateful for the microwave in the room as I didn't fancy going out by myself much in the evenings. The free breakfast is nice, if a little basic, and the chefs serving up waffles and omelettes were very friendly. The noise outside did wake me once or twice, but it's not unbearable.

Hannah M,10,,2016-11-30,COUPLES,2016-11-05,1,WORST HOTEL EXPERIENCE EVER,"Worst hotel I've ever experienced!!! 
Staff is rude, arrogant and unprofessional. Booked the hotel because they had free parking but when we got here, parking for one night was $24. I therefore asked the receptionist about the free parking, and she said we could park in the street if we wanted to risk a fine. Served in a unnecessarily rude tone. 
We then continued to check in, where you have to agree to ridiculous terms and conditions such as that the hotel is not responsible for any insects or insect bites during your stay. Both of our credit cards got declined - we asked for a reason - got none. We then asked the receptionist if they didn't take foreign cards and got another silly, arrogant response: ""Yes, ALL THE TIME"". We then continued to find an ATM in order to pay with cash instead. And due to the one in the lobby only partly working, we had to find another one in a laundromat across the street. When we came back to the lobby, the receptionist was busy on his cellphone, leaving us waiting for way too long. AFTER AN HOUR of trying to check in we finally got our room - one facing the street of course with the most noise possible. Room is worn down and average motel-like. Wet patches in the ceiling, holes in the walls, chipped paint, cracked bathroom tiles. Not worth your money. 
Breakfast better be the best god damn one we've ever had. I DON'T RECOMMEND ANYONE STAYING HERE. This place is the reason Airbnb is a success. Use that instead of this overpriced, arrogant, sad excuse for a hotel.",,1.0,1.0,,1.0,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-10-10,"Dear Guest...

It is a mile or two from Hollywood and Vine and the Highland Center. There really isn't anything close to the hotel. No restaurants or attractions so plan to take a tour, taxi or drive. The hotel staff is accommodating and Jose and Hugo cook a fabulous breakfast daily which is included in the cost of the room. The hotel is under renovation and the rooms that are finished are impressive. The hotel is clean and people are always working on the tropical garden area. If noise is an issue, ask for a room on the back side or interior courtyard. The traffic on Vermont can be really loud on Friday or Saturday nights. Overall, I would stay again. Rooms are a little overpriced, but it's Hollywood.",,,,,,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-12-18,"Dear Guest,

Yeah it's no Hilton but for the price and location I was pretty happy and thought we got a bargain! We easily caught an Uber everyday into Hollywood Boulevard and even got one to Disneyland for a bargain price.

We are two females in our mid 20's and we spent quite a bit of time walking past at late hours of the night and did not feel intimidated. WIFI was a bit iffy in our room but we were in one of the last rooms of the hall and it seemed to work ok-ish if you sat in the chair in corner of room. Worked fine in the lobby.

kirstyb42,86,"Thetford, United Kingdom",2016-10-31,FAMILY,2016-10-27,3,Not bad,"I would have graded this very good if the location and staff were nicer. 
We stayed 4 nights on arrival i felt staff were a bit off and given we had just come from a super friendly hotel in san francisco.
Our room was clean and looked onto the nice little courtyard. Wifi was a little so so didnt bother me but my son got grumpy about it
Pool area lovely you arent even aware you arent in a particularly nice area. 
Breakfast is really good loads of choice eggs and waffles cooked to order. The only thing is the breakfast staff are so utterly miserable. Especially when you smile and use your manners and you get grunts. 
Area isnt nice but actually most of LA  is dirty and full of poor homeless people. There is a nice italian on the corner plus a little supermarket.
We used uber to get around do not use taxis they are a rip off.
Also the metro is on the corner you can get to universal return for under 5 dollars. Do not buy the tickets to universal from reception as they are$169 ...on the gate they are $110 plus $5 metro.
I would recommend this hotel as it is really good value for money. I would just say to the hotel management get your staff to smile a bit more and be a bit more helpful. Its the small things",,,,,,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-10-30,"Dear Guest...

bexythepirate,310,"Yeovil, United Kingdom",2016-10-31,COUPLES,2016-10-19,4,Well located hotel with friendly staff,"The Hollywood hotel is (unsurprisingly) well located for Hollywood and Universal Studios. It is 200 metres from the Vermont/Santa Monica Metro station which in turn is a few stops and about 15 minutes from universal. The hotel is not the most modern, however rooms are clean, well appointed and of a satisfactory standard. Flat screen TV with plenty of channels, a safe and coffee machine are provided in all rooms. The hotel has a swimming pool available to guests although we didn't use it. Breakfast is included whilst is a real bonus in Hollywood. The breakfast is buffet style, well presented and wholesome. We found the reception staff cheerful and informative. Cinthya was informative and most helpful in assisting us navigate the city. We were four adults so a taxi to the airport was appropriate for us at about $60 but the hotel will arrange a shared shuttle (chargeable) for single travellers/couples. A good base for Hollywood offering good value with an included breakfast in a city where hotels can be expensive. We will use again if visiting the area.
TIP 1: Use the Metro for getting around (Metro covers trains, underground and buses). A TAP card (read Oyster card) costs $1 you then charge it up at a cost of $7 for one day (valid until 3am the following day) or $25 for 7 days.
Tip 2: Santa Monica and Venice beach are worth a visit and can be reached by bus from the Metro station near the hotel.
Tip 3: If intending to visit Universal studios buy a 2 day ticket (only $14 more than a one day ticket) online in advance from the Universal site, this will afford you early entry up to one hour prior to general admission.",Ask for a pool view,,4.0,,5.0,,4.0,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2016-10-24,"Dear Guest,

The system kept dropping out and when I called the IT Support it was found the server kept putting my laptop into the spam filter and dropping me off. When it worked it was reasonable fast. The complimentary breakfast buffet was somewhat disappointing. There was not a large range of items to choose from and there was never any bacon on offer which I would consider a breakfast standard item. The food was cooked well. I was hoping to get dinner at the hotel but the restaurant only does breakfast so I had to go looking for dinner, the hotel staff helped with pointing out where the restaurants and the fast food places were.

We arrived around 8pm and we were checked in within 10 minutes. Our room was on the third floor and had everything we needed. It had a fantastic coffee machine with Starbucks coffee, safe, microwave, iron and ironing board. We parked our car ourselves and were given a pass for our stay which was the only negative thing really as the cost of parking was $24 per night. There is a little shop in the hotel and a lovely intimate but very clean and well maintained pool with beautiful sun loungers and clean towels provided at the pool area itself. There are also saunas but we did not try these out. The complimentary breakfast is the jewel in the crown of this lovely hotel where omelette, eggs, waffles and pancakes are all cooked fresh to order by the super friendly staff. There is also everything else you could possibly want to eat for breakfast and saved us money cos we filled ourselves up in the morning and didn't eat again until dinner in the evening. Before attending I read a lot of reviews about the area being dodgy and whilst it is not the nicest area, if you have a car then it isn't a problem and superbly located for hollywood boulevard, walk of Fame, Griffith observatory and universal studios. We also travelled to santa monica one day and we were there in just half an hour. Overall we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Hollywood hotel and wish to thank their super friendly and helpful staff for having us. Hotel very much recommended!",,,,,,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-10-30,"Dear Guest...

Andy B,6,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",2016-09-30,COUPLES,2016-10-10,3,"Good, but could be so much better","A good hotel, which could be a lot better with a few simple touches.  The service was great and the hotel is clean and well-kept, but (as of September 2016 anyway) there is no bar service in the evening, nor any evening restaurant service. The hotel has a lovely interior courtyard bar but it's effectively wasted since you can't get a drink [apparently this was due to staff shortages, but how hard can it really be to find a barman in L.A.?]. Also there are some nice shaded terraces but these are off-limits in the evenings, again when you'd most want to use them. Of course, we only found out these things long after we'd checked in.

Recommend you check directly with the hotel as to what amenities are available, before booking.

Service:  helpful and informative.
Rooms: nice - fairly modern, and clean.
Location:  good road and transport links, but fairly limited amenities within walking distance.
Breakfasts:  great - Juan, Hugo and the team will do fantastic omelettes just the way you like.","Courtyard unused in evenings as of September 2016, so interior rooms may be quieter",,4.0,,3.0,3.0,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2016-10-11,"Dear Guest,

Included breakfasts were great, but no room service or food otherwise. Courtyard bar wasn't open at all during our stay. Rooms good size and well cleaned, showers a little dated. Rooms onto courtyard the pick. Courtyard tops for a beverage & pool was great for cool down. But the best thing was the great staff.

Kevin W,32,,2016-08-31,FAMILY,2016-10-05,4,Nice stay!,"I booked this hotel thinking it was closer to Hollywood Blvd, but it was on the east side. We were dropping our son off at college so it was not a problem as we used Uber to move around.  Our room was clean, the breakfast buffet was great but that was the only food service available.  If you order in, it is from a local restaurant and takes a while to deliver.  The outdoor pool was small but nice and no alcohol was allowed. Generally the overall appearance of the hallways or front desk area were immaculate and the staff very helpful.  Some renovations were going on in the hallways but never interfered.

jon127,35,"Chester, United Kingdom",2016-09-30,COUPLES,2016-10-05,2,The description of this hotel is exaggerated beond belief,"Advertises Mini Bar in room = No mini bar, when I asked, where it was the answer was ''they took them out'' no further explanation given.

Advertises 21st Century living at its best = Dirty floors in room, No balcony furniture, Bath blocked, Sink plug inoperative so sink could not be filled, Kitchen sink tap very loose in the sink frame, tired old looking kitchen in junior suite.

Advertises decorated with luxuriant European designs = Come to Europe and look, we don't have that much peeling paint in our bathrooms.

Advertises Cutting edge technology= WIFI is poor at best,  don't know what else they think is cutting edge! possible the vending machines

Deposit boxes = in reception, so if you have jewellery you have to store it there, a right pain when your deciding what to wear that night.

The advertised bar lounge was never open, the courtyard bar was never open. we ended up standing in our shower water because the bath drained at a snails pace. we advised reception manageress who said it would be fixed but never was, as with the sink plug.

I'm sure the owner runs a very nice blue Porsche 911 as there was one in the car park each day but never at night, a little more on the hotel and less on the wheels wouldn't go amiss.

Its a shame because the place has the potential to be really great with some TLC in the rooms, some new technology and some bar staff.

Best thing about the hotel was a very good breakfast (and great breakfast staff) included in the day rate which counteracted the $24.00 a day cost they scalp you for parking your car in their car park!",Try another hotel,,,,4.0,,2.0,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2016-10-07,"

Rhian W,23,United Kingdom,2016-09-30,FRIENDS,2016-10-01,4,Nice hotel,"Stayed here with a friend for 5 nights, the only downside to this hotel I felt was the location. Although near to public transport links the hotel is in a pretty bad part of Hollywood, me and my friend (females in late 20s) did not feel safe walking outside the hotel after dark.

The hotel itself is really nice it has a good pool area which had plenty of available sun loungers which were really comfy. We had a room with 2 queen beds in, the room was really spacious and had a good size bathroom.

There was breakfast included which had a good variety. Eggs, pancakes and waffles were made to order with a good choice of fillings. There was also cereal, pastries, fruit, cold meat available as well.",,,5.0,,3.0,,5.0,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-10-31,"Dear Guest,

shirleykearney,5,"Dunleer, Ireland",2016-09-30,FAMILY,2016-09-28,5,Fantastic place to stay,"Stayed here for a week early september. This was my second time in this hotel as i stayed last year. Wow is all i can say. We were checked in by Michael who was very helpful. I noticed the hallway had been painted so much brighter and a lovely fresh feeling to it. Our room was next door to one we had last year similar layout. Two queen beds were so comfortable my 15 yr old daughter won't stop talking about how comfy the pillows were and wants the hotel to tell her where she can buy them. The ensuite had all you need. Quite obvious room had been recently painted too. Looks great. Breakfast every morning for the week was just amazing. Hugo is one in a million and we want to take him back home to Ireland with us. Always greeted us with a smile and a good chat .He spoiled my daughter every morning with a teddy shaped waffle. Juan who helps Hugo was also very helpful. We miss our cooked breakfast in the morning. The lovely Nancy helped us out when we needed to book a trip to warner bros she could not have been more helpful, rang them up and printed off all we needed. Thanks again Nancy. Hotel is close to all attractions and a car is not needed. Bus stop is directly outside hotel and underground two minutes walk. Hopefully will be back next year. The only thing missing is, is the Irish flag flying outside among all other flags. Great value for money.",,,5.0,5.0,,5.0,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-10-31,"Dear Guest

honeyCornwallEngland,16,,2016-09-30,COUPLES,2016-09-28,1,Give it a miss,"Checked in here for three nights .
Unfortunate it was a terrible experience, on check in were given room 324 this was a great room nice and big unfortunately the smell was awfull, on reporting this to front desk their solution was spray air freshener, all this would have done is mask the smell I refused,they moved us to room 308 this room was tiny did not even have a closet, and to top it all the smoke alarm in the room started to beep at4am because it had a low battery, reported this the next morning and maintenance did replace battery, we then went out for the day returned at 7 pm to discover room at not been serviced when we reported this ( front desk must have dreaded seeing us coming) were told housekeeping had gone home, they arranged fresh towels and took away the rubbish but that was it.
Spoke to the manager Giselle in the morning, her response to my issues was that I was lying about the room not being done, (why would I) She then offered me 2 nights free parking but only if I signed something to say I would not leave this revue ( so now she tries to bully and bribe me) 
Overall the management is terrible they have a don't care attitude about their guests,all they want is your money and intend to give as little as possible in return, small things matter even at breakfast they ran out of butter were told there wouldn't be any more untill the next day.
We. Spent over £200 per night and didn't even have a closet or room serviced.
I do not recommend this hotel.

Kim175,13,,2016-09-30,COUPLES,2016-09-25,3,"Ok stay, could be better ","We recently stayed at this hotel for 3 nights - hotel itself is big, clean and did the job for a few nights. It is 5 min walk from a metro station that will take you to Hollywood boulevard/universal etc for only $1.75pp each way. As per previous comments lifts were very slow! Parking also ridiculously priced and should be included seeing as the hotel wasn't exactly cheap anyway. Breakfast was OK - fresh omelettes were the highlight, everything else was average. Also was not happy with a sign on wall in dining room advising that there are detectable traces of a chemical within hotel that could cause birth defects amongst other things! For a newly wed couple this was concerning. Hotel also advertises an appertizer happy hour in courtyard - this was not on during our 3 night stay. Nice small pool area only used once. Area isn't great and a few unsavoury characters around however never felt particularly unsafe - however never went out alone. Waba grill takeaway couple minutes walk from hotel is quite nice if you want an alternative fast food other than burgers and fries. OK stay, but would probably not stay here again.

Rigla_,11,"Tamworth, United Kingdom",2016-09-30,COUPLES,2016-09-23,2,Not great...,"On arrival at the hotel everything seemed great...got to our room after a 5 hour drive to find we'd been put in a room at the front of the hotel which we was a bit unsure about as the traffic was heavy and very loud, neon lighting from businesses across the road and the occasional sirens and loud car coming past made us ask for another room. Even though we requested a nice room for our honeymoon...this was totally disregarded. We asked and they couldn't change us as the hotel was ""full"". Next morning we could change so we stuck it out. Our night in the room wasn't great the traffic didn't die down till 1-2am and even then it was constant. The fan in the bathroom was really loud like it was from the Stone Age. The room was small. Marks all over the doors and walls. My biggest fault was the lifts...how slow are they!!!! Seriously 37 seconds from ground to 3rd floor...that's a joke. We changed rooms the next day. Same room layout on the back of the hotel with a shared balcony. Room again was damaged on doors and walls. Not just in the room the hallways though out the hotel looked like they were mid-construction. Breakfast was free was about the only plus I found. Basic breakfast options that you'd find in any modern average hotel. One chef one waiter. All buffet service. No tea bags on first morning. Parking was a joke almost $30 a day to park in their own rear car park...should be free for the price you pay to stay. Hardly secure all you have to do is press a button and you can walk in. $30 a day you'd expect 24 hour secrity. I won't drone on but you get the idea not great but if there's no where else it'll have to do. ",,,,,,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2016-09-26,"

AzzaUK,22,"London, United Kingdom",2016-09-30,SOLO,2016-09-16,4,Good hotel ,"Stayed here twice recently, once in standard room, and once in an upgraded room.

Both of the rooms were great, really comfortable and very spacious, and with fridges and microwaves - comfy beds, air-con and clean and well looked after. The older rooms are clearly a little bit dated, and it seems like the hotel is going through a bit of gradual refurbishment at the moment. 

All of the staff were really helpful and friendly - even checking in at very late hours was easy.

The wifi works well around the building, and there is a nice courtyard area to rehab in. There's a swimming pool and sun lounger area for relaxing, though the pool isn't heated, which made the hotel a good place to be when not out around LA.

There is breakfast is included in the room rates which is a nice extra (though I never made breakfast, being nocturnal and up late, so missing this each day)

I've stated there a few times, and would certainly go back again if looking for a hotel in the area again.",,,,,,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-10-30,"Dear Guest,

ADundar,4,,2016-09-30,COUPLES,2016-09-15,1,Fake Promo Code !,"First I should say this review is not about my stay in the hotel-it is reservation phase.

I was searching online to find a hotel to stay in my LA trip on 9/27/16 and I was looking for the special offers to see if I can find a good deal. So I saw Hollywood Hotel's offer saying '35% off room rate Was: $179 Now: $116'
 and 'Valid for Redemption: Apr 5, 2016 - Dec 31, 2016
Offer valid any day of the week.'

How to redeem
Use code: LH35

Also there is a link below 'Redeem Online' which directs me to Hollywood Hotel's webpage. When I put the promo code and check availability it says the hotel is full but when I go without the promo code bunch of rooms are available. And then I tried to call them and make the reservation through the hotel by phone - same thing, I explained them and they had nothing to say but telling me about their current rate. And then I called TripAdvisor customer service and they say 'every hotel manages their own offers&announcements page so there is nothing we can do about it'

I would understand that if there was any explanation saying that the promo code is limited with certain rooms but there is not such thing written - Hollywood Hotel shouldn't be advertising promotions that they can't honor, it makes this a 'fake promo code' to attract people attention. I spent hours to figure this out - not fair.",,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,,HollywoodHotel1,General Manager,2016-09-17,"Dear Akin813

Thank you for considering Hollywood Hotel during your stay in LA.  Thank you for writing your review and I'm sorry you were having difficulty accessing the discounted rate.  The conditions of the Tripadvisor Coupon is stated as follows:

While your review states your arrival date of 9/27/16, your departure date or the number of nights you were intending to stay was not stated.

mic1469,5,"Tokyo, Japan",2016-09-30,FRIENDS,2016-09-13,3,Clean room and reasonable price,"Stayed for a week with friend.

The room was big and clean, bed was comfortable. TV is big and with no noise, maybe the best TV I've ever seen in hotels I lived.

The place was quiet and didn't feel unsafe even at night.

The price here was quite reasonable, so instead, (maybe) the staffs were not very friendly as I expected. Especially in the restaurant. Never saw them smile at all.

So, if you want a good budget, choose this place. If you wanna have a happy trip, better find somewhere else.","the shower place was too narrow, even for a small guy like me.",,3.0,4.0,,4.0,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-10-30,"Dear guest...

Location isn't the greatest but it wasn't a problem, as still close to central of everything. The only concern I have of the hotel was that a friend of mines item went missing. When we told the hotel staff it went missing, the hotel maid came round the next day with it saying it had accidentally been taken during cleaning.

Luanda J,10,"Greater London, United Kingdom",2016-07-31,FRIENDS,2016-09-12,3,Thank Goodness for Gisel,"After arriving very late in the evening, our experience turnt sour rather quickly with the staff member that greeted. They were extremely rude and unhelpful. We were also given a room which did not match any room advertised on the hotel website. 

The next morning, we raised our grievances with Gisel who I have to say, if it wasn't for her I would probably never go back to this hotel. She empathised and apologised for our experience so far and relocated us to another room. 

Throughout our stay Gisel and her other colleagues were the most helpful and in fact I could not ask for a better service so thank you very much, they definitely went above and beyond!

Breakfast is also available. The chefs were brilliant -  Nothing was too much and they were very friendly. Be sure to have an omelette - freshly made before your eyes:-) 

I was in a group of 4 girls and we walked around fine, the area isn't the best but there is a metro station approx 5 minutes from the hotel and there is also a strip of restaurants a short walk away (approx 15 mins). 

There is also a lovely outdoor bar area with seating and a laundry room which we found very uselful.

All in all, an affordable stay!

CanadianLovesTravel,8,"Victoria, Canada",2016-09-30,SOLO,2016-09-11,3,Fine if you're on a budget,"I would say this hotel is fine if you get a reasonable rate (if I recall, the rate on their website was not great). If I'd paid full price I would have been disappointed.

The area is convenient. While I thought it was quite poor/sketchy when I arrived, it seems that's pretty well the outward appearance of most places in LA/Hollywood and after getting used to that, felt comfortable in the neighborhood.

The housekeeping was poor, and I don't think I have EVER said that. My issue wasn't with the cleanliness, but with the replacement (or lack thereof) of towels and other basic items. There were many little things that added up for me, but one bar of soap (there was no body wash, so this was both for showering and hand washing) was provided to me for my 4 night stay. I have no issues with using the same soap, but I would have appreciated one bar for the shower and one for hands. Again, there were other minor issues that added up to annoy me. Honestly, if I had asked at the front desk for the missing items, I probably would have ended up asking for everything. I also don't think that in 4 days my sheets were changed at all.

The bathroom was also dated (paint slapped on over rust, rusty towel bar). None of this bothered me as I got a good rate, but I could easily see some guests not being okay with this.

I will say that the breakfast was excellent. I only had Hugo make my omelette/scramble for me once, but it was likely the best I have ever had! Quite a few options as well.

I also had good experiences with everyone working in the reception area (I'm unsure of their names, but of the 3 or 4 individuals I spoke with, they were all helpful and pleasant).

Overall, I wouldn't highly recommend this hotel, however I do still think it is a good value.",,,3.0,3.0,,,3.0,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2016-09-13,"Dear Guest

Monica T,3,"Melbourne, Australia",2016-09-30,NONE,2016-09-09,3,Go Elsewhere,"First impressions are everything and mine was not good.  Arrived earlier than check in time and was told to come back at 3pm which was absolutely fine.  Came back at 3 and was told I had to wait as they were in the middle of a shift change.  What sort of hotel schedules shift changes at check in time?  I stood at the counter waiting while 4 staff members stepped away on their computers and talked amongst themselves.  Every now and again one of them asked what I wanted and I just kept repeating that I was waiting to check in, by the time the fourth person asked me I quite loudly stated ""I am just trying to check in""!!  The woman then checked me in but was very abrupt and did not bother explaining any features of the hotel or where anything was, very bad attitude.

The hotel serves breakfast but not dinner which is a bit inconvenient as it is in a pretty dodgy area.

All in all the breakfast staff were great and food very good but the front desk staff ruined the experience.

Also $25 per night for parking is a rip off.",,,,,,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-10-31,"Dear Guest...

SixofusBristol,21,,2016-08-31,FAMILY,2016-08-29,3,Interesting stay......,"We arrived after a long road trip from Las Vegas to be told only one of our three room bookings had been paid for. This was incorrect and despite showing the credit card statement the male receptionist would not accept the rooms had been paid for. This resulted in a long call to the booking office who confirmed the rooms were paid for and eventually after speaking to accounts the check in clerk accepted all rooms were paid for and we booked in. No apology. 
The beautiful picture of the 'Hollywood Hotel' is in fact in the car park at the rear of the hotel. The hotel is in a very seedy area which is surrounded by a large group of tented homeless people although they did not bother us. Just be careful, we didn't walk anywhere in the area but it was a good base for Hollywood, Beverley Hills, Universal Studios and Disneyland. 
Breakfast is served in the basement and there was a good choice. Eggs were cooked to your chosen choice and very tasty. Rooms were a little out dated and could do with modernisation. There is a beautiful courtyard in the middle of the hotel and the pool area was very clean. 
The 'room service' advertised is in fact a selection of take away menus and the advertised bar was never open. 
There is a small shop open in the morning and evening and the gentleman who ran it was always very helpful. The shop was not overpriced. 
Car parking is payable $24 a day and is paid locally. 
As a base the hotel was fine but we would not return. Wifi is hit and miss so not recommended if you need to have a good access to emails etc.

sopkatlane10,12,"Hemel Hempstead, United Kingdom",2016-03-31,COUPLES,2016-08-26,4,really lovely and friendly hotel,"This review is rather late as we stayed here for 3 nights in the spring of this year, sorry! Myself and husband (mid 30's) booked this hotel based on the price and the photographs because it looked like 'old Hollywood' style. we didn't quite realise that Hollywood is actually a really large area of LA and that we wouldn't be walking distance from the main strip and tourist areas, in fact we didn't really think the area was that great - However it really didn't disappoint!

The staff where incredibly friendly and helpful - especially dealing with stupid questions from 2 extremely jet lagged people, they helped with universal tickets, where to grab some food, how to use the metro system, literally amazing!

We decided to use the Metro system (being from London it didn't phase us) and it was super easy and cheap, the station is only a 5 minute walk from the hotel. The area itself wasn't that great with a few homeless people walking around, but I get the impression that its fairly standard around LA. We walked to the local store to get some food and snacks and it was fine.

The room was beautiful, lovely comfy bed, good sized bathroom with great water pressure and plenty of towels. We had a ground floor room facing the courtyard and I loved it, it really felt like Hollywood from the movies!

The breakfast was fantastic and such lovely people serving the waffles and omelettes, they giggled lots when I got very excited about having a bear shaped waffle!

Overall a great place to stay if you are happy with using Uber or Metro to get to the tourist stops, as we where in bed by 9pm every night (I'm blaming jet lag, not age) we weren't fussed about the lack of things to do within walking distance.",Ground floor facing the courtyard was peaceful and glamorous!,,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-10-30,"Dear Guest

Gretchen M,67,"Grosse Pointe Woods, Michigan",2016-08-31,FAMILY,2016-08-24,4,Very Pleased!,"Family vacation started with the idea of visiting Universal Studios and seeing ""Hollywood"" for two days as the start of a 9 day west coast trip, so my search was for a reasonably priced hotel in the area that would accommodate my family of 4 that includes 2 adult children.  Being totally unfamiliar with the area, the location was ideal, the price was right and the online images sold me.   We booked one room with two queen beds and checked into room 310.  Very large room with min-refrigerator and microwave.  Lots of  bed pillows and very nice bed linens.  (Bath towels were OK.)  Room had tile floors, small closet, small bathroom, but plenty of room. View was onto Vermont Ave, so not great, but could see Hollywood sign (had no issue with traffic noise).  Hallways were wide and newly updated - good first impression. The lower level, where we watched open mic comedy the night we arrived, and had full breakfasts each day, was really well designed and well kept.  While we didn't use the courtyard, it was exactly as the photos depict - very nice!  I did see a number of others using it during our stay.  Pool is good sized (it's across parking lot) and had very nice cushioned lounge chairs with readily available towels.  We took advantage of that space twice.  Looks like they're renovating an attached outdoor space by the pool, so additional amenities may be available in the future.  

While not in the nicest/cleanest area, once you were on-property, it was very nice.  We walked to a few nearby stores to pick up a few things, and never felt like we were unsafe.  We used UBER to get to/from Universal and Grumann's Chinese Theatre, and paid no more than $8-12 for the 4 of us each time.  Metro stations are close by, but I think UBER was cheaper, faster and we didn't have to learn the public transit system.  My adult children had friends in the area, so went out Fri & Sat nights to experience local brewerys, bars and the Santa Monica pier.  Nothing more than 15-30 minutes away, so location was good in that respect too.

My only problem was with location, the picture they use for the front of the hotel is not at all accurate, I have no idea where it comes from, if you are planning to take taxis everywhere this location is good because it is fairly central, if you are planning on doing any walking I would not recommend this place.  The area is very sketchy, did not feel safe walking around (2 girls, both from NY).  The area gets much nicer about 2-3 blocks away, but the one night we walked alone we encountered multiple homeless people and other questionable people.  Would have liked to know this about the area before booking.","First floor rooms walk directly into the court yard,cannot have shades open at all, literally people sitting outside your sliding doors.",,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2016-08-25,"Dear Guest,

C W,3,,2016-08-31,COUPLES,2016-08-18,5,Awesome hotel - great location!,"We booked the hotel through Expedia for an awesome price and we weren't disappointed!

We chose to do public transportation while we stayed here in LA and having the metro right by the hotel was a plus!  We were able to take the metro to Hollywood walk of fame, Santa Monica, Universal Studios, Koreatown and Union station!

We also booked tickets online for universal studios and needed to print them.  Unfortunately the printer station downstairs was out of order but Nancy Ramierez at the front desk came to our rescue!  She immediately had me forward my email to her and she printed them straight out for me.  

Second bonus was the fact that breakfast was included and it was amazing!!  Made to order any kind of eggs you wanted and waffles too!  Saved us money and we always left the hotel full of energy and ready to go!

Only con I would say is at night the area can be a bit sketchy but unless you are out to the wee hours of the morning I think you should be ok.

I was questioned why I require 2 tea bags - actually I like a strong tea.

Great staff very very high sense of service to customers.,"just a couple of blocks away from the metro station, the hotel is a great location for a family spending few days visiting LA; big and secured parking lot for those with a car like in our case when we stayed there early July 2016, for 4 nights with a room big enough for 2 adults and 2 kids. Staff at front desk was great, with relevant information about events, nearby restaurants and ways to access places to visit; and kind enough to propose to print my e-tickets to Universal studio. Rooms are not with the most recent equipment and finishing, but this hotel remains with a very good value for the price given the very strategic location for leisure purpose. And I confirm that eggs service at breakfast is worth the stay.

The staff were super helpful and kind. The pool was nice, although a little cold but was fine once you were in and the sun beds were great, really comfy with towels provided. 

The back of the hotel is where the fountain is and that is beautiful, shame you only see it if you go to the parking lot or the pool. 

Location isn't ideal, we had to get Ubers or the train everywhere but it is right across the street from a subway which is really useful and easy and cheap!

Cathryn Q,45,"Pipera, Romania",2016-07-31,FAMILY,2016-07-27,5,Hollywood hotel ,"A beautiful hotel in an ideal location. Very close to Hollywood Boulavard, walk of fame and the Hollywood Sign. Metro and bus stop within 5 mins walking distance. 
The rooms were very spacious with a private balcony. We were lucky to be there on July 4th and were able to see at least 20 firework displays from our balcony. 
Breakfast is included in the room rate and is delicious and varied. 
The staff were super helpful and friendly. They gave us good directions on how to get the best view of the Hollywood sign. 
Our only criticism is that the stunning bar with beautiful outdoor furniture was never open and room service was unavailable.

Nicki M,20,"Worcestershire, United Kingdom",2016-07-31,FAMILY,2016-07-26,3,Not Bad But Could Fo Better!,"Stayed here with my adult family for 3 nights. Reception staff are very helpful (and apologetic)! Breakfast staff OK but could be better.
Rooms are clean but tired and need updating particularly the bathroom. Shower, skirting boards, door frames all need attention. Rooms on small side but fine if your stay is short. 
Breakfast is good... If you live the all American. Small amounts of the 'healthy stuff' is available. They had no fruit one morning and when I asked for some I was told the produce didn't arrive the day before! Really??? We're talking LA here not the middle of Africa! I did complain at reception and the next day we had fruit. 
The gym was NOT clean! Again complained 2 days on the trot as nobody attended to the matter. On the third day hooray it was cleaned thoroughly but only after I told them if it wasn't clean id expect some sort of refund off my bill! 
Would I stay again? Only if I have too.

Alibaabaa_9,11,"Kings Langley, United Kingdom",2016-07-31,FAMILY,2016-07-25,5,Fab hotel!,"We loved this hotel, the staff were so friendly which makes a huge difference to the atmosphere! We had 2 rooms, one with a queensize bed for myself and my partner, and one with 2 queensize beds for my 2 grownup sons. Both rooms were on the ground floor and ours looked out over the central courtyard. The rooms were a really good size, as were the bathrooms. The hotel had a nice little swimming pool with a pretty sunbathing area which is accessed to the side of the rear carpark, my son and I spent a very relaxing day by this pool! The included buffet breakfast is lovely, you can order an omelette, scrambled or fried eggs and add all sorts of ingredients to it. You can also have freshly made waffles. There is a large selection of cereals, breads (toast if you wish), spreads, ham and cheese, sausages and potatoes,  yogurts and fruits as well as a selection of fruit juices, tea, coffee and water. The hotel is close to Hollywood Boulevard, but you need to travel by public transport or bus to Santa Monica Pier or Venice Beach - we used the metro station just along the road from the hotel and bought tap metro cards. The area is a little iffy at night, but I never felt unsafe (I never went our alone though!) There are quite a few food outlets in either direction along North Vermont Street, my favourite was Yogurt land, hmmmmm, lol!! Overall we had a very enjoyable stay here and would probably stay again if we ever return to Los Angeles! ",,,,,,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2016-07-26,"Dear Guest,

Clean and comfortable rooms with great views of a courtyard/ bar seating area. This added a really nice feel and touch to the hotel especially when it's lit up at night- you can go to have a drink or even relax in the evening. There is also a bar and lounge area which is open in the evenings. The hotel had great facilities including a pool (towels provided), sauna, gym, shop etc. Breakfast was good with a variety of cereals, omelettes, waffles, fruits and pastries. The location is ok. A metro/ bus is needed to travel into the main area of Hollywood, however, transport is very cheap and continent ($1.75 for a journey each way). Overall, I really enjoyed my stay at the Hotel Hollywood and would recommend as I felt very munch welcomed and happy whilst staying there.

it is highly overpriced and the image of the fountian is from the car park that you wont see unless you pay 24 dollers to park in it per night or if you really need to walk all the way through the car park to get to the pool area

so to recap overpriced and very poor service and management look elsewhere also had to get my bank to reclaim the 100 pounds they deducted that was only meant to be a deposit on hold be warned",,,,,,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2016-07-25,"

Chloe G,2,,2016-07-31,FRIENDS,2016-07-21,4,2 girls week long stay,"I stayed here with my best girlfriend in early July for a week, and we felt like this place really offered what it stated. The hotel offers a complimentary buffet breakfast to all guests... And hands down BEST Omelette i've ever had! Jose (the chef) that cooked breakfast various mornings throughout our week stay was both charismatic and excellent at his job. Cannot commend him enough! 
When we initially checked in, it was late in the afternoon, and were unfortunately given the ground floor room that was only a short walk from the front desk.
Michael (from front reception) gave us the option to change rooms the following day as we were there for a week and were given a 'noisy' close-to-the-road room. We did change the following day, and as a result, were given a top floor room with a courtyard view. This place really felt like home for the week.
Side note, the comedy nights they hold downstairs are great for a little bit of a laugh and a wind-down after a big day. The bartender down stairs was fantastic too. Great drinks!

There is renovation work going on and I understand some rooms are freshly updated so be sure to request one of these.  The grouting around the tiles in the bathroom was black in places with mould.  Our pillows were small and lumpy.  The breakfast was distinctly average but the omelette man produced a great omelette if that's what you wanted.

Because let's face it, driving in LA is a nightmare because of the suffocating traffic. Hotel is nice and clean, decent standard, decent breakfast and a nice pool area.

Mindy94,187,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",2016-07-31,FAMILY,2016-07-18,4,Excellent value.,"We arrived on July 9th for a 5 night stay. On arrival we were offered early check in for $30 more which we gratefully accepted. I had been corresponding with Gisele on the front desk before travelling to confirm my booking with Booking.com and the price as it seemed very reasonable for 3 adults in July. We received a second floor modern room with 2 queen beds. The room was massive for the 3 of us and was exceptionally clean. Plenty of towels and toiletries although we prefer to use our own. There was a safe, a microwave and a fridge which we used to stocked up on juice and water  from Right Aid supermarket one block down to the left. 
The pool area is very good. Comfortable loungers, pool towels, a water dispenser and more importantly a chair to help guests with disabilities into the pool. 
The area outside the hotel is not the best but in no way did we feel unsafe. The metro is a 5 minute walk away to take you to most attractions. Outside the metro the shuttle to Griffith Observatory runs on the weekend.
The only reason I do not rate the hotel a 5 is that on 2 occasions we returned to find our room had been left open by housekeeping.  On the first occasion we were of the attitude that maybe we hadn't closed it properly so we were extra careful each time going out with 2 of us always checking the door. On the Tuesday morning we left the hotel at 7am to go to Disneyland, not returning till 11pm. When we returned our door had been left open again. Ok it wasn't left totally ajar but you could tell it wasn't closed properly. We had started our trip in Vegas and had bought lots of gifts, thankfully  most of which we had locked in our empty cases. Thankfully nothing was disturbed but it was extremely disconcerting knowing our room had been left unlocked for so many hours. At that point we informed the front desk that our room was not to be serviced until we checked out. 
This was the only blip in what was an excellent stay and based on the value and great staff I have to say I would return if visiting LA again.",Ask for a remodelled room.,,4.0,,5.0,5.0,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2016-07-21,"Dear guest...

The room was modern, clean and spacious. Really comfy beds and one night we ordered a Pizza Hut to the room as we were enjoying chilling out there. Breakfast was great, the man making the omelettes was really friendly even under pressure. Could not fault the hotel at all.

The hotel is lovely and much better than the reviews make out and even better than we had anticipated. Breakfast is really good, they do practically everything.
Bedroom is great and so clean and relatively spacious with a nice bathroom. We had a room with a balcony overlooking the courtyard which was stunning at night and no noise at all. The cleaners were also helpful and good at their job. 
I understand that it's not in the best area in LA because there's a lot of homeless people about but I think if you venture out you will realise that LA is full of homeless people, even in Santa Monica, it's just how it is. I am an 18 year old female and my friend is a 17 year old female, we were British travelling alone and managed to stay safe. Be smart and don't go out at night or if you do then take a cab or an uber. 
The reception staff were so helpful, we were helped by Cynthia and a few others and all of them were very helpful and even printed out directions for us to get the bus and gave recommendations about where to go. 
Overall it is in a handy place, right by the observatory, close to two metro stations, close to main bus stops and everything else is a cab ride away. Just be smart and safe when you go out.",,,,,,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2016-07-21,"Dear Guest,

Carol G,36,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",2016-06-30,COUPLES,2016-07-13,4,Comfortable But In Need of An Update,"We arrived after a long trans Atlantic flight to find LA right in the middle of a heatwave.  Tired and hot we checked in with very friendly and helpful reception staff.  Unfortunately, on getting to our room we immediately had to request a change as our booking specified we would have a safety deposit box in our room which it didn't.  Hotel is not in a great area, although safe enough, and we planned to be out and about all day so did not want to have to hike around with passports, electronics etc.  Husband had to point out that we had a choice of hotels and we picked this one due to location (to Universal Studios) and facilities offered and we were moved to another room by manager after he checked we hadn't used anything in the original room.
New room was on a higher floor, had a slightly better view and a safety deposit box so quite happy.
Went downstairs to courtyard for ""Happy Hour"" to find not set up and ""Happy"" does not include a discount on the drinks.  Very nice complementary munchies but drink was expensive (as we found it was pretty much all over California despite the fact that I drink wine and they produce it - could take a leaf out of the European's book).
Stayed in hotel four nights with breakfast included.  Hotel was clean but we were in a freshly refurbished room, towels changed every day if required and location was actually great as very close to public transport links.  Air conditioning an absolute must due to heat wave - even the locals said it was too hot.  Subway is just down the road and once we worked out the tap card system we were more than happy to make our own way about.  
Only downside was that there was not really many choices locally to eat.  No evening meals provided by hotel so had to go out.  But again most places easily accessible from subway.  Information in room did include local restaurants but not that easy to find them and not keen wandering round a strange neighbourhood.  Information on what each TV channel was might have been more helpful.
Cannot advise on pool (it did have one) but we didn't have time to use it.
Breakfast was great although a little limited.  No bacon - I love American bacon but sausages and hash browns with eggs cooked your way in the hot offer.  Could also have waffles, omelettes etc as well.
All in all a decent, comfortable stay.

Very comfortable with a nice breakfast. Staff were very helpful Jessica and Paul at the front desk were particularly helpful.

Lauren Grace,41,"Cambridge, United Kingdom",2016-04-30,COUPLES,2016-06-29,4,LA trip 2016 ,"Although a fair distance from Hollywood Blvd (but we knew this when booking) we still managed our way around with no issues, mainly using Ubers and we even tried a bus (although getting very lost!).

The staff were so friendly and helpful and my personal favourite part of the stay were the amazing breakfasts each morning - those omelettes can never be beaten! 

We spent most of our holiday out of the hotel and using the hotel for a base to sleep and eat breakfast at, however we did use a few of the amenities whilst we were there! The pool was great, albeit very cold! And we used the sauna once too, which was quite a treat. 

One downside would be that the rooms, even though the decorating and furniture seemed new, the actual decor and bathroom was old and dated. The shower head was pretty disgusting, but seeing as we weren't actually spending the holiday in the shower we turned a blind eye! 

All in all, a great hotel and a great stay! ",,,,,,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2016-07-06,"Dear Guest,

Hugo and Jose were very accommodating to my 6 year old niece who wanted waffles and scrambled eggs all the time. The area is close to convenience stores and great places to eat. There is a 24 hour laundry place across the road which was handy as the hotel self-laundry services close at 10pm. We felt completely safe in this area. There is also a lovely Mexican place called Danys Deli very close to hotel which serves delicious Mexican food. There is also a Metro station very close down the road too.

A-V-Williams,4,"Cambridge, United Kingdom",2016-06-30,FAMILY,2016-06-27,2,Never stay here!,"This hotel is a total fraud. From the pictures you would expect a very different presentation than what you are greeted with! Even the image they use to advertise the face of the hotel with is of the rear and not the front.

This hotel is in need of a serious update. And they must know this because they advertise rooms with a fresh grey and lilac decor. But we were not given one of these, probably because there are only one or two in existence or they are staged for marketing. We got a room that had an awful stale smell and as soon as you sat on the bed it sounded like the springs and creaking would cause the bed to collapse! 

A room with double beds and both made this terrible sound. Knowing we wouldn't be able to sleep all night we requested a change of room. This request seemed to put the front desk receptionist's back up straight away. He reluctantly showed me another room and upon my sitting on the beds I found the same issue. He mumbled something about them all being alike because of the box bed base. I refused this room and he took me to another (even having complained I was not shown a new or updated room as advertised on the website). The third room he showed me on the first floor was the best of a bad lot and the beds didn't squeak and creak quite as much but still were a problem. 

The neighbourhood made us feel unsafe and it was so loud we heard no end of police cars throughout the night.The noise could be largely down to the fact that the patio door which was practically hanging off the hinges was single glazed. 

We were glad we had our car with us. 

All staff we encountered were largely unfriendly and unhelpful. The parking attendant and gentlemen serving breakfast were the only few friendly faces that deserve a mention.

We stayed in a number of hotels and motels throughout this vacation, and The Hollywood Hotel was by far the worst experience.",,,1.0,,,1.0,3.0,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-12-18,"Dear Guest

We frequent California but have never stayed in this area. Won't be back. To enter the gated parking you have to get out of your car with quite a homeless population. We had to ask people to move to get in. They weren't very happy too... We faced the city (ask for the courtyard) so we heard people yelling, traffic etc all night. Saw two dog fights. It was close to a few of our stops this trip but I think we'll just drive in next time.

Breakfast was in the basement- typical food but was nice to have eggs prepared for you.

mitcheycsb,7,"Minneapolis, Minnesota",2016-06-30,FRIENDS,2016-06-13,2,Multiple Issues,"Let me start off by saying that I have been staying in hotels for YEARS and have never felt compelled to leave a bad review until now even when past experiences were not that great.

1) Although I arrived early, I was very surprised that one room was not available.  Again, partially my fault because I knew check-in time was 3PM, but 90% of the time, hotels have open rooms and I doubt this place was fully booked.
2) The couch in the lobby was completely missing a cushion.  It gave a very bad first impression of what was to come.
3) Once I did check in, I had traveled a long way and wanted to take a nap and could not due to very loud construction across the hall not to mention outside noise due to my room being on the street side.
4) There was no hot water, I had to take a lukewarm shower.
5) In order to save space packing, I relied on the bathroom hair dryer which was a mistake.  It was a manual hairdryer that was the equivalent of someone blowing on my hair.  I had to go to dinner with wet hair because the dryer did not work.
6) Although the decorations were updated, the actual walls/ceilings/shower were outdated & rusty.
7) When I arrived home after dinner, there was a large spider on the ceiling directly above the bed.  I called the front desk twice with no answer.  I finally went down to the front desk (the guy did not apologize) and a nice maintenance guy came to my room and killed it for me.  After that, I did not sleep well due to the noise outside + I felt like bugs were crawling all over me.

I got an early flight home the next morning because I wanted out of this place!",Do not get a room on the street side,3.0,3.0,2.0,,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2016-06-14,"Dear Guest,

Could do with a dressing table to get ready at, however, wheeled a chair through to the bathroom and sat at the mirror in there. The hotel offers breakfast every morning but there is no variety, same things day in, day out...you can have eggs cooked to however you would like and the staff are friendly, could do with mixing up with some different sausage, meats or some bacon on certain days, we got bored after day 3 and ate out from then on. The hotel pool area is ideal, kept very clean and tidy. The only complaint I would have is the price of the parking, $24 dollars per night racks up if you are there for more than a couple of days, could do with having an offer on to help out with parking costs, after all, it doesn't cost much to have a space In a car park, howevr, it is secured which was settling.","Ask for a room overlooking the lounge area outside,the fountain is beautiful",4.0,5.0,,,4.0,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2016-06-14,"Dear Guest,

The breakfast was definitely one of the best we had during our trip around California. The staff were exceptionally friendly and were always keen to make us blueberry teddy bear shaped waffles. The omelettes were also very tasty!
The location was ok, but I struggle to think where in LA is a ""good location"" since everything is so far spread out! We had a car and very grateful for it! It is only $15 taxi ride to Hollywood Boulevard which was good for a night out.

The restaurant does not open for dinner but it seems quite acceptable to order in food and they provide some phone numbers you can order from and the room has a microwave. Otherwise there are several fast food places nearby. If you want a better restaurant you have to walk about 20 minutes north on Vermont across Sunset Blvd where there are several, including good Thai and French ones.

Arthur V,1213,"Perth, Australia",2016-05-31,COUPLES,2016-05-28,4,Very Good 3 Star Hotel,"We picked this hotel from other viewers reports and was not disappointed.

It took us over 2 hours to get here from LAX but that was because the driver took the quicker route.  If he had taken the freeway we might still be trying to get there.  On arrival we were greeted by pleasant staff and check in was quick and easy.  Our room was comfortable although right next to Vermont Street which is quite busy but the general traffic could not be heard, it was only the sirens of ambulances and police that caused us some concern so if going to stay here ask for a room at the back of the hotel.

The room was quite sufficient in that it had a big bed and a reasonable sized bathroom with all the required complimentary toiletries.  Each room had an iron and ironing board as well as a coffee maker, microwave and small fridge.

It is one of the few American Hotels that offer a complimentary free breakfast which was excellent with a variety of fruits, cold meats, cheeses, eggs to order, cereal tea and coffee as well as fruit juices.

There are plenty of decent eating places nearby as well as a shop that sells everything from medications to hardware and you get a decent discount if you can quote the hotels telephone number.  We shopped there twice and saved over $20.00 which was great.  

The only compliant that we had was that throughout the hotel there were signs that said:  ""Join us in the Courtyard for complimentary snacks between 5.00 - 7.00 pm but the six nights we were there we never saw any thing that resembled this so I guess they no longer do it.

The hotel is near a Metro Station which gives you access to most of Hollywood for $1.75 a trip which isn't too bad.

The staff were very pleasant and willing to go out of their way to provide good advice in regard to restaurants etc.

Swati S,57,,2016-05-31,SOLO,2016-05-27,4,Great and Safe,"I visited LA on a solo trip and this was my second trip after 2008. I was scared to visit LA alone due to the stories I had heard which happen after we cross the 5th Street. Hence, I was very careful in selecting the place I will be staying in. I went through a lot of reviews and made up my mind to book this hotel. Upon arrival I took an uber and got dropped to the hotel. My experience from the airport to the hotel was great as the uber driver was very nice to help me with my two big sized bags and carefully dropped me to the right place. On reaching to the hotel, I was greeted with the big smile and the staff at the front desk was very professional. They had all the details of my booking and I was checked-in in less than 5 minutes without any waiting. I was helped till my room where the person at the lobby was kind enough to take my luggage till my room (very rare to find that courtesy in the US). Mostly you are on your own even if you are loaded with luggage, unless you are checking in a 5 star resort. It was a cosy room good for a couple.. But since I was solo, that room was good to stuff my two big bags and later on my shopping bags ;) this hotel has an old world charm to it and the bathroom was very basic American style but since I am not a fussy traveller, I got all what I needed. Good toiletries, decent shower with hot water and most of all clean environment. My room was on Level 1 and it had a nice seating outside the room where I could relax... If needed.. (Even though I didn't use it much due to the cold weather). The housekeeping was efficient and helped me with extra hangers. The breakfast was good and the live egg and waffle station was the best.. Overall I had a comfortable stay and would like to return back to the hotel if I visit LA again. I forgot to mention but this property is located in a very safe area and is close to all the attractions like Hollywood, Beverly Hills etc.. It's a good value for money considering the sky rocketing prices of the hotels in LA. ",,,,,,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2016-05-31,"Dear Guest,

","The hotel is located on a busy blvd, approx. 5-10minutes walking from Vermont/Sunset metro station. Some of the rooms appeared rather old, others have been renovated.

The bathroom was pretty dirty when we checked in and also was not taken great care of by the cleaning staff. 
The hotel offers complimentary breakfast from 6.30-11am - the breakfast is ok - from pancakes, omelettes to ham/cheese, fruit and cereal all the basics were offered.

The bathroom had a nice big and clean shower.  Our rooms were very clean. The staff were very pleasant.  The outdoor pool looked nice, but the only reason we didn't use it because we went to LA in November and it was too cold to go in the pool.

Dillitante,4,"Perth, Australia",2016-05-31,COUPLES,2016-05-18,5,It Must Be Just Like Living In Paradise,"When we are on the internet looking at places to stay in the city we are visiting it is difficult to get a location or a good deal price wise if we have little idea about the geographic or standards. My first visit to America, Los Angeles and I am so pleased with myself that I chose the Hollywood Hotel in Vermont Ave.. Located right next to Santa Monica Blvd, which means a $1.75 bus fare all the down to the beach Pier and check out all the activities and festivities . A two minute walk to the Metro subway which will take you to Hollywood, or Universal Studios, down town Los Angeles right there at your doorstep and again only $1.75 for the train. Easy and so convenient.
The Hotel staff are warm and friendly, helpful and knowledgeable with all inquiries. The Sauna is private you have to book it though, the rooms are spacious and service is 5 star, and amazingly enough to add to all this you get a free cooked breakfast every morning with fresh fruit coffee, tea and cereals. I was totally surprised at the complete package we received at the Hollywood Hotel for the money we paid,  I highly recommend this Hotel, you will not need a car and the place feels like Home after a full day sight seeing. do Enjoy",,,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-11-06,"Dear guest...

journalist-sheetal,16,,2016-05-31,COUPLES,2016-05-18,5,Best breakfast and general service ever!,"I have to boast about the amazing breakfast we enjoyed with chef HUGO at the Hollywood hotel. He made our breakfast experience unforgettable each morning, with various waffle options and shapes. Every food request was made with love and sincerity. His kind spirit and thoughtful customer care, was like a home cooked meal and really a home away from home delight. Breakfast is complimentary, starting at 6.30am each day with a stunning variation of cereals, cold meats, bagels and pastries Etc. 

Reception staff were even more brilliant and friendly! Every tour and hotspot suggested ending in stunning outings. Staff at the hotel were knowledgeable about transport routes and other. 

The subway transit on both ends of the street, which are just a few minutes walking distance from the hotel, also made our travels everyday; cost effective and easy to navigate to main areas.

They were painting the hallways when we were there. There is a breakfast room downstairs (lift) offering everything you could want for Breckie Lovely competent chef who makes all the egg dishes you could want fresh. There is a gym and pool across from the car park. A big surprise was a little kiosk selling everything you could want or need. Good prices too, souvenirs as well, cheap tshirts.
Night desk staff were great lots of information and help, better than the day ones. Very close to the metro and buses. Also a few shops for cheap easy meals.

GemmaNewbery,22,"Cheltenham, United Kingdom",2016-05-31,FAMILY,2016-05-15,5,A lovely hotel. Highly recommend!,"I'm a nervous traveller and this was my first trip to Los Angeles, first holiday abroad without my folks and it had been 6 years since I'd been abroad. The hotel came by recommendation from my sister, who stayed here a couple of years ago with friends, so I knew I'd be in safe hands. 

The staff were lovely. The front desk team called cabs for us on several occasions (a good cab firm too), the staff in the restaurant were fantastic. Kudos to Sonia in particular, who always went out of her way for a chat in the mornings. The breakfast were delicious and the choice was vast; I highly suggest trying the omelettes! The maids serviced our room every day and always said hi to us in the corridors.

The room was clean, big and light. The bathroom was nice and had the biggest shower I've ever seen! We did a lot during the days, so it was good to come back to a serviced room every day and chill. It was nice to have the option of having take away delivered to our door from various places recommended by the hotel. 

The pool area was nice and felt private. The centre of the hotel has a furnished court yard with fountain and evening bar. We spent a couple of mornings there relaxing in the shade.

The hotel is surrounded by plenty of shops, pharmacies and food options as well as a short distance to public transport. We took the 704 bus to Santa Monica for $1.75! It's a bit of a journey, but it's so worth it.

Hollywood Walk of Fame is a ten minute drive away, Universal Studios in about 15 and Beverly Hills in 20, so the hotel is in a handy location where you're close enough to all of the big attractions.

LilyMoon,30,"New York City, New York",2016-04-30,FAMILY,2016-05-02,3,Unfortunately had some issues,"It's too bad that we had a number of issues during our stay here because the hotel had some nice features and is located conveniently for us. My first issue was with the parking. I was told one thing at check in, another by the parking attendant and then had a confrontation with a third staffer at the front desk who gave me a totally different story. My second issue was with the hotel rates. I got a nice reasonable rate by booking online through tripadvisor. When I went to check out, the rate was considerably higher and even though I had a printed copy of my reservation, they refused to honor it. I will be taking this up with my credit card company. Thirdly, they use the same tiles on the floor of the shower stalls as on the walls....they are so slippery that I slid and almost fell. Wrenched my back from that little fiasco.

On the positive side, the hotel rooms are nice and spacious, the beds comfortable, the complementary breakfast is nicer than expected and the hotel is well kept and clean.

Unfortunately I can't overlook the problems I encountered, so will not choose this hotel for future stays in the LA area.",,2.0,2.0,,,4.0,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2016-05-05,"Dear Guest,

This hotel is in the heart of everything, you can easily take the bus to the Walk of Fame, the Dolby Theatre  and you can get to the Santa Monica Pier with just one bus. You really don’t need a tour Guide to charge you $158.00 from the tour that the hotel recommended.  I did have concern about the area. It was a bit sketchy. There was a homeless encampment right around the corner, and we did not leave the premises at night

Nice hotel, good check in time, nice staff, large rooms, comfortable rooms great free breakfast. Hotel was well kept and clean. Good pool but not too many loungers so need to be there early.

Bob G,1,"San Francisco, California",2016-04-30,FAMILY,2016-04-15,4,Very good stay with some minor exceptions,"The hotel was really nice and the staff were excellent and helpful.  The room I had looked a bit small as well as a  small bathroom counter.  I booked this through Universal Studios and got a great deal, but I think there are probably much better and larger rooms.  So I think I got what I paid for.

I did have concern about the area.  It was a bit sketchy. There was a homeless encampment right around the corner, and I would probably not leave the premises at night with my daughters unless I had a car.  I never felt unsafe at the hotel though.  My guess is that when it was established in 1908 the area was not that bad.  It just got that way over time.

The Complimentary breakfast was excellent.  There was so much to choose from that no matter who you traveled with, there was something that everyone would like.  The made to order omelets were the best!

Gisel was a big help to us and was very courteous and helpful when planning our Hollywood tour among other things as well as check in and any questions I had.

They did have a rental car service on site, which I think would prove helpful to go sightseeing around the tourist areas.  Walking to those areas would have take a bit of time.

All in all I had a great stay.",,,5.0,,3.0,4.0,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-11-06,"Dear Guest

blakecelliott,1,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",2016-04-30,COUPLES,2016-04-10,1,Terrible Customer Service,"I had a booking with this hotel from booking.com that was ""Pay at the Hotel"". They went to charge me a hold of the first night's stay which I have no problem with it is in the T's&C's, however was not expecting it and the ""hold"" was declined.

I was advised via email my booking would get cancelled if I don't update my credit card details and 2 days later my booking was cancelled. I did not see the email advising me to update the details until the day it was cancelled. 2 days notice is not sufficient time before cancelling a booking!!!!

I then called the property to re-instate my booking and update my credit card details and was told that they could not do this directly and i had to go back to booking.com. However the price was $400 more than what I booked for.

I asked to speak to the manager and was told he was ""in a meeting"" however he had just advised the receptionist that they could not re-instate the booking so not sure what ""meeting"" he was in that he couldn't take my call. I left a voicemail for the manager with a phone number to contact me on and was never called back.

Overall 2 days notice to update credit card details before cancelling a booking is very insufficient and they don't even have the courtesy to return a phone call!!

The quesadilla was not presenatable at all and tasted disgusting, lacking flavor. Besides being a lazy cook, he was also rude to his co workers.

AaronNMegen,3,"Christchurch, New Zealand",2016-03-31,FAMILY,2016-03-28,1,Hollywood Horror Hotel,"We are a family of four and stayed for 4 nights last week.  We had been travelling for a month and I had printed the website for each hotel before travelling to recall expectations and confirm advance payment, etc.  

The room photos on the website are nothing at all like the rooms on offer.  After checking our room, we asked why the rooms were not those advertised.  Front desk advised that only the modern, renovated rooms were on the website.  We asked to move to one but found out that less than 1% of the rooms were renovated and those were in use.  We were stuck with the remaining run-down, very dirty, run-down rooms.  Very disappointing.  Front desk staff advised that we could raise this issue with management in a narrow set timeframe the next day but the time was too inconvenient for us (we had tickets to tours).  Front desk staff need training to be able to pass concerns to management and deal with issues for customers - customer liaison is a main part of their job.  

The conveniently located vending machines have little on offer and steal your money.  Not convenient. 

The washing machine, clothes dryer and parking is well over priced compared to all other hotels were stayed at during our month (double the price of anywhere else).

A coffee for a family of four in room and never replaced when used.  Toiletries not replaced daily.  Very minimum clean daily.  

Run-down, old, dirty, unhelpful, unfriendly, inconvenient hotel.  

We pre-paid but the hotel still insisted on a $100 hold fee.  We gave our Visa and unlike all other hotels that placed a hold on the card, this Hotel took the money outright.  We have requested and are still waiting on a refund and after reading other comments on TripAdvisor, are very concerned that the refund will not occur.  

We have never reviewed a hotel before but feel obliged to warn other families.  Any Best Western or Days Inn would beat this hotel hands down.   

The only positive about this hotel is the good breakfast.",Ask for a newly renovated room.,,2.0,2.0,,,1.0,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-09-26,"

This is not a five star hotel but a nice cheap, clean and convenient hotel. It's what we were looking for and didn't disappoint. 
The red line metro underground station is a five minute walk so that means it's easy to get to most places in Hollywood or even LA. Perfect for non drivers like myself.

Vinal P,73,"London, United Kingdom",2016-03-31,COUPLES,2016-03-16,1,Disappointing!! ,"I have been staying at this hotel since Sunday evening & booked it purely because it received such great reviews however, I am utterly disappointed at my choice. Upon checking in, the lady at the front desk informed us that we would be checking out on Thursday which left us in a state of panic as, we thought that we booked 1 less night than we were meant to. Double checked our confirmation this evening to realise that she was in fact wrong! The room itself is very, very basic. The bathroom could do with a bit of updating as it is cold, old and not the nicest. The cleaner does not replace toiletries which I found to be quite shocking as every hotel that I stayed at in the past does replace toiletries daily. And the cherry on the top was that there was what looked to be a pubic hair on one of the freshly replaced towels (pic attached). 
Based on all that I've mentioned, I do not believe that this hotel deserves a 3 star rating. Please don't be fooled by previous reviews or the pics on booking sites as they have proven to be pretty misleading. ",,,,,,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-09-26,"

AlyssaD509,3,"Cleveland Heights, Ohio",2016-03-31,BUSINESS,2016-03-07,5,Surprised me!,"When traveling to this hotel from LAX, I drove through areas of the city where I didn't feel safe. The part of North Vermont that the hotel is not the best either. However, less than a 5 minute drive north you're in a nicer area with some great places to eat. (Highly recommend Il Capriccio by the way, their bread and pastas are absolutely wonderful!). I did not have a vehicle, so I did not have to deal with the daily parking fee (which is quite steep). However, I was pleasantly surprised with their newly renovated rooms. I was quite comfortable, and the housekeeping staff were excellent and friendly. The breakfast was one of the best complimentary breakfasts I've ever received as part of a hotel stay! The pool area is quite nice too (though I wasn't able to use it due to the cooler weather we had). Overall, I would stay at this hotel again.","Though the rooms with a balcony have a nice view of the garden, there is no seating to enjoy it and it can be more noisy.",,5.0,4.0,2.0,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-12-18,"Dear Guest,

Also, reception is helpful and offer advice on local sights. They operate a key code for access after 10pm which avoids waiting for a night Porter.

LA is a massive place where nothing seems to be close to anything else, but I wouldn't count a 30 minute metro ride as ""close"". Unless you have a car or are prepared to pay for taxis everywhere, the first thing to do when you arrive here is to go to the Santa Monica metro station (3 minute walk) and get a metro pass for the length of your stay. This is the only affordable way to get from the hotel to anywhere interesting (DO NOT try to walk!). The hotel itself is clean, friendly and attractive but it's in an area that feels very dodgy at night (we only ventured out for dinner once).

They charged us $150 for some extra fee that we never agreed on. Asked them to email us a copy of the receipt and it never came through either. 
The advertisement that said ""car rental $25/day"" is a big fat lie. After we signed some paper, they told us about a bunch of other hidden fees. Ended up paying heaps for one day worth of car rental. 
Also, got scammed $150 without any explanation whatsoever.
This is an absolute disgrace. Your hotel should discuss this with the car rental service you provided.

Male on front desk very helpful  so was the concierge.  After that though females on front desk. Our room smelt of sick we didn't notice on first day as we were out of the room the whole day  only noticed when we got back and our clothes stank.  I spoke to the ladies on front desk not reality  interested  apart from having a go that we hadn't  noticed on our first day.  Cleaner was sent but it still didn't  go away.  All in all poor customer service.
Breakfast no complaint. Very good choice.
I wouldn't  recommend  to stay if you have children.  Doesn't  feel the safest of areas and as we were on the ground floor, I felt like I was always listening out in the night.

The staff were really pleasant and helpful, thanks to the lovely girls and guys on reception especially Giselle who tried to help me locate a item I had left in a taxi.

Rooms were clean and had all the facilities you would need.  

Gym was good

Breakfast was complimentary and was really good value and quality.

Overall a good experience and I would stay here again.

One tip:  Taxis can be a little pricey, however the metro, which is 5 mins walk away is ideal for visiting the surrounding areas and also very cheap.

When we first pulled up, we were a little concerned about the location.  Once we stepped inside, we were pleasantly surprised.  The decor was nice, clean and spacious.  The room was a little smaller than expected, but worked out fine.  The bathroom was spacious.  More counter space and/or shelves to place personal belongings would be helpful, but for the price I really can't complain.  We had a nice balcony that overlooked the lovely courtyard.  The breakfast selection was more than expected...fresh fruit, pastries, juices and more.  Sonia and Hugo were very friendly and helpful and went out of their way to ensure our breakfast experience was special.  The omelets and waffles were delicious!!!  All of the hotel staff were very friendly, professional and helpful.  I loved that the hotel offers gated parking with an attendant on site. This is a very nice hotel with wonderful service.

It was clean and had free breakfast and WiFi. Only downside was you have to pay for parking 25$ a day. The pool we did not use. It was in the down season so it had not been cleaned because as Canadians we were the only people in shorts in January. Although the 2nd day when we came back to our room. Our door was left open. Opps. No big deal only all my money iPad and shopping bags left inside. That left us uneasy. The area around the hotel isn't the greatest but lots of basic necessities near by. The best part was the signs in the basement that says ""This building may have material that may be harmful to pregnant women or cause birth defects"" for a building built I think in the 1930s I guess it could be worse. Rooms were nice, people were nice and I was happy. ",,,,,,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-11-06,"Dear Guest,

I had a class the night was to drive up so I called ahead. The receptionist was very polite and assured me I'd be fine coming in late.
When I arrived I was greeted by Nancy (I hope that was her name) and she quickly checked me in. 
The room was very pretty. It might be time to start touch pips but it was well lit and decorated. The balcony overlooked the courtyard and held a lovely view.
The next morning my friend and I went to their free breakfast. It was great! Even if you don't want to eat, go for the free coffee and to watch Chef Hugo work the omelet line. It was at least 10 deep and as soon as he finished one omelet another person would Jon the line. He's cheerful and polite while working his butt off.

Ali,5,,2016-01-31,BUSINESS,2016-01-20,5,Excellent Budget-Friendly Hotel,"I really enjoyed my stay at this hotel. Hollywood hotel has several advantages:

1- Very close to Universal Studious.
2- Close to Griffith Observatory.
3- One Bus ride to Santa Monica Beach ($1.75 only)
4- Hotel is clean and nice.
5- Their Breakfast is very good. Especially when 'Hugo' cooks your Omlete. He is doing excellent job.
6- Room service is doing their job very well.
7- I loved the smell of the Mango Shampoo they put in the toilet.
8- Hotel staff are friendly and polite. All of them smile to you whenever you encounter them.

On the other hand, here are some disadvantages:

1- Room Space is small.
2- Elevators are too slow
3- The Hotel's main door needs to be fixed.

At the end, the overall evaluation for the hotel is excellent. I will not hesitate to book at this hotel again.",,,,,,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-12-18,"Dear Guest,

Waakas888,33,"San Ramon, California",2016-01-31,FAMILY,2016-01-04,3,Ok/ Great Breakfast ,"This was a mediocre stay.  I did not like the feel when I arrived the front desk clerk was not very friendly.  He seemed a little rude.  I also did not like that you had to sign your life away to stay there.  There were 4 of us staying starting New Years Eve and I felt that you could not go outside because there was no Starbucks nearby however there were a lot of great restaurants within driving distance.  We get to the room and it has a linoleum floor which I have not seen ever in a hotel room.  The
bathroom was tiny and the beds were comfortable but squeaky.  The room had no closet but that my be due to the fact that is was built in 1904.  Back to the bathroom it only had a shower and it really needed to be updated.  The shower water was temperamental.  The one thing that did look updated in the bathroom was the sink.  I also felt like the lighting needed to be updated and there needed to be a lot more electrical outlets for all the electronics that we had with us.  I really liked the tv and I am glad they offered in room movies that were very current my son and I watched the good dinosaur and the peanuts movie which was great.  Also we really enjoyed the breakfast that came with the stay.  The chef Hugo and the other chef the 1st 2 mornings were very helpful.  The lady chef came back to us and offered to make as many strawberry waffles as we wanted.  I wish I got her name.  Chef Hugo made great omelette's.  I also thought the breakfast had a great variety of items.  Well worth it for just the breakfast😊.  I am not sure that I would stay in the hotel again because the hotel needs a lot of updating and the maids were very early in knocking on the door and that is because we did not have a Do Not Disturb sign and I noticed that other rooms taped on a note that said do not disturb.  Also one good thing that the hotel did offer was an open mic comedy Wednesday thru Saturday but I asked the front desk and they said they did not have it the weekend we were there due to New Years but I went by the lounge and they did have it the Saturday night.  I wish they would know more about what is going on in their hotel.  I am only give them a 3 because of the breakfast.",,,,,,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2018-11-06,"Dear Guest,

None of it turned out to be true. We are 2 girls in our 20's, and had no problems at all. The area may look a little shady, but that's just what the non-tourist part of LA looks like. We took the subway  day and evening, and took cabs by night - and we felt completely safe the whole time.

The room was beautiful, beds were comfy, and the staff were friendly. The breakfast provided downstairs was great - cereal, toast, fruit and omelettes & eggs cooked however you wish.
The hotel is a minute or two walk to the train station which will take you into the tourist area of Hollywood. Lovely.",,,,,,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-10-20,"Dear Guest

mel1967987,2,"Montevideo, Uruguay",2015-12-31,FAMILY,2015-12-26,5,Great Stay!!!,"My 2 daughters and I stayed for 4 nights. We found a deal in booking so it was a real budget for us. Los Angeles is not a nice city except for Sta Monica or Venice Beach so this hotel was the best that could ever happen to us. Beautifully decorated, clean, great breakfast (it was a real meal, the best bagels or pastries I had ever tried, great omelettes and a wide variety of cereals)), lovely patio. We didn't use pool nor fitness, you don't need these when you travel, you want to see new things, you are out of the hotel all day. But it was lovely to get back at the end of the day to this hotel. The neighbourhood is O.K.you feel safe at all hours and you have the metro station a block away. Next to the hotel is a kind of shopping centre where you find fast food and a Rite Aid which is more a supermarket than a pharmacy where you get great discounts if you show your room key.

EdgarCosset,1397,"Brooklyn, New York",2015-12-31,SOLO,2015-12-20,3,Good Enough!,"“Good enough” describes the Hollywood Hotel, a very clean tourist accommodation offering a warm greeting and a modest but full range of amenities. Recommended by a local friend as an economical choice near the main Hollywood sites and for its very generous breakfast, this turned out to be completely true. Generally my fellow guests were young vacation travelers: singles, couples and a few families, many speaking other languages. I asked several about their experience and they were uniformly pleased with the choice. 

The facility is pleasant only showing its age in such anomalies as rooms with baths en suite but no closets. My room had a wide balcony and a crisp view of the Hollywood hills. Although with the carefully taped shattered balcony door glass, minor chipped paint and a couple of cracked bathroom tiles, the room either missed the vaunted renovation or I failed to appreciate its historical charm. Nevertheless, the bed was firm, outlets were convenient and the water was hot enough for a comfortable if not luxurious bath. Better, it had a space heater, microwave, fridge and respectable Seattle brew. The desk was large enough for my wallet and watch. I slept very well. 

Oddly the much photographed, charming grand entrance is at the back facing the parking lot, which is large, secured and attended. Inexplicably the Vermont Street façade architecturally is “tourist nondescript.” (Guessing it has something to do with changing street maps over the century since the building went up.) The fitness center is small but practical (bike, elliptical and treadmill). Similarly the bar is limited, but the lounge is comfortable. December was too cold for the outdoor pool, but my guess is it enhances the hotel as a great bargain in the summer. In the end, however, the included breakfast buffet is the star of the show. It’s wonderfully generous with made-to-order eggs and waffles, euro cold cuts, a range of bread and pastries and friendly service. If I needed to be in this part of LA again, I would definitely consider returning to the Hollywood Hotel.",,5.0,4.0,,,3.0,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-10-20,"Dear Guest,

It's undergoing a remodel so it has lots of new beds, bathrooms, tile floors, etc. It has a fitness center, pool, sauna, happy-hour, business center, laundry room, gift store and best of all a quality hot breakfast where they cook your eggs to order. The staff is super friendly and helpful. It's only a block from the Metro so it's easy to get there. 

I only have two complaints. First, the neighborhood is a wasteland with no interesting places to eat or go. Second,  there was an artifical fragrance smell in my room from the floor cleaner.

Sia S,3,,2015-12-31,BUSINESS,2015-12-10,3,"Pretty Hotel, Staff needs retraining","Other than the lovely women working the breakfast area, (EXCELLENT full service breakfast included) this staff needs retraining.

 I actually had a busboy rudely and loudly (embarrassing me in front of a room full of people) try to stop me from taking my ill husband a small bowl of cereal, some fruit, and a juice, upstairs to him. His arrogance was unheard of in someone in such a position. 

The maintenence worker who came to fix the lack of hot water in our room (which turned out to be a ten minute lag) rudely said 'what, this not hot enough for you?' When it was luke warm. I learned to run the sink and tub for ten minutes prior to getting in the shower. 

The beds needs new mattress pads badly, and comfortors that don't weigh a ton.

The halls are very loud, and the hotel is near a fire station, with sirens all night long. I walked through a tent city of homeless to get to the store.

Not a single machine was stocked with anything but coke, diet coke, and water. The only other option-Sprite , was sold out on all 3 floors. None for sale at front desk. Snack machines wouldn't take bills properly. 

The hotel grounds are pretty, the courtyard gorgeous. This place COULD be great. Mini fridge, microwave, coffee maker, safe. I don't know if every room has it, we were in a corner suite. The balcony was nice for fresh air, but didn't feel safe leaving the door open while sleeping. It is a shared, with minimal dividers, balcony. 

The parking is 25 a day. Hopefully you're not in a rush to exit the lot when the guard isn't at his post. We were. For the room rate, it was no big deal, but seems chincy.

The tub is dirty and with anti slip spots, stained from other's dirt....bleach & friction....it's an amazing thing. Try it. All other cleanliness was fine. Disposeable cups instead of glasses, which is more sanitary.

521974,1,"Cairo, Egypt",2015-11-30,NONE,2015-12-05,1,A RAT friendly hotel!!! I found a RAT in my room,"3 weeks ago I was accommodating in this horrible hotel together with my son and I would never recommend it to anyone!  We thought we will spend a nice vacation or even just a normal vacation but instead of that we were staying the first 3 nights with unexpected room mate...A RAT!!! As any tourists once we checked in; we opened our bags, got everything out and we went out for sightseeing the town, when we returned back to the stupid ugly room in this dirty hotel we heard a noise in one of the bags, we found a RAT jumping and playing everywhere in our bags, our cloth, and perhaps also anything else you can imagine a rat can do on our toothbrushes!!!! We called the reception and they sent someone I assume he was from the HK or maybe a rat-sitter because he didn't do anything but telling us that there is a hole in the bathroom and that's where the rat hides!!! This is really disgusting and the shift manager of this horrible place reacted as if it is something normal to happen and we as guests shouldn't be angry!!! My son spent a time trying to catch the rat and running after it in the bathroom!!! Is this normal!!! A rat staying peacefully in a bathroom of a hotel room till the guest check in and complain!!!! Is this a rat friendly hotel?!! Anyways, they finally moved us to another room which is renovated but not promising after the experience we had from the previous one but we had to accept it as we are strangers and it was midnight and couldn't take my son and keep searching all around the town for another hotel. On the next day the manager just apologized and they did not even do the least by refunding us the 3 nights we spent with the rat!!!…If the rooms are that bad, would the rest of the rat's family accommodating at the kitchen and testing the food for the guests?!!! Really disgusting!!!  I can never image how their kitchen looks like and the back-area as well if the rooms are that bad!!! Did they hear about something called Hygiene H.Y.G.I.E.N.E!!!!! 

Again, I would NEVER under any circumstances recommend this rat friendly hotel to anybody.

Adam P,109,"Qianjin, Kaohsiung",2015-11-30,BUSINESS,2015-12-05,4,"Nice place, not-so-nice neighborhood","The hotel itself was great.  
Room was very comfortable.  Not large in size, but had basically what I needed and felt comfortable in it.  
Hotel had a nice exercise room and even had an outdoor pool (you have to walk out back through the parking lot to get to it, but is fenced off and comfortable to be at).

The parking is expensive, but there is street parking available right in front of the hotel and right next to it which you can park overnight for free.  Otherwise I recall it costing around $20 a day to park, and street parking you'd have to pay a meter for during the day.  Note, street parking starts at 9amish where you'd have to pay so if you're not leaving early would have to watch that.

Breakfast buffet is great, and Hugo made great omelets in the morning (I found out his name I was so impressed with his cheeriness and good eggs he made in morning).

You wouldn't want to walk around at night in the neighborhood where the hotel is, but with the paid parking behind a closed gate (if you want to pay) or street parking literally a 1 minute walk to the front door, it's not so bad.  And probably the best deal for a descently nice hotel in the area.",,,4.0,4.0,,4.0,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-11-07,"Dear Guest,

I made them show me a room before we checked in. We determined that the room was fine. We decided to stay
They have a free breakfast which is fine. Very accommodating and friendly. The omelet station needs a little work on speeding up the process. 

The room was nice. The floors are all laminate. No carpet. They should be mopped every day. My feet were dirty after taking a shower.

Roxie C,61,,2015-11-30,FRIENDS,2015-11-24,4,"10 night stay, no problemo!","After reading so many reviews about this place varying from either end of the spectrum, I wasn't really sure what to expect. 10 nights is a long time to stay in a hotel where things aren't right.
So imagine my surprise when I got to the hotel, around 19:30 after a very long day's travel to find that the hotel was actually very nice! 
The layout was tidy, clean area, very quiet and spacious! Friendly staff at the reception area, welcoming and helpful with any issues or problems we may have had.
The rooms were spacious, we went for a double queen size room as there were three of us staying. We couldn't, however, find the safety security box which was described as part of the room and we could have done with a bit more space to unpack our clothes, we ended up living out of our suitcases the whole while we were there.
The rooms weren't all that noisy where we were, only a few sirens a night but nothing major, apart from the very noisy neighbours who would get up around 04:30-05:00 near enough every morning with their children to shower and go out for the day - not the best way to wake up and start our day! 
The wifi was pretty decent, it blacked out every so often but not for long usually. The breakfast buffet was lovely however it got boring quick. As nice and filling as the omelettes and scrambled eggs were, it got quite repetitive so we ended up going out for breakfast on most days.
The hotel has a comedy club in certain days - I never attended these but my friends I stayed with weren't impressed with the standard of comedy being provided and said that it all closed around 23:00.
Sure the area didn't look appealing, but the hotel was down the road from a medical centre and also right inbetween two metro stations and there were metro buses to hand - both methods of transport were more regular than clockwork!

lorettapittman,3,"Pasadena, Canada",2015-11-30,FRIENDS,2015-11-21,5,Amazing service,"This was my second stay at the Hollywood Hotel and again I am impressed with the service. Our first encounter was with Gisel on the front desk. She was very pleasant, always smiling, and offering information and input with out being asked. We were using public transit and presented her with many questions , but not once did she show frustration or make us feel as tough we were a bother....two thumbs up to Gisel.

Then there was the staff of the restaurant where we received a free breakfast each morning.. The main male cook ( whose name we didn't get:( ) was very friendly and made an amazing omelette. Then there was Sonia who, after we mentioned needing gluten free, informed us that she could make  us gluten free waffles. we felt this was a grand gesture as it was a very busy breakfast line and she would be required to make a special batter..which she did..and the waffles were awesome. I highly recommend  this hotel to anyone who wants a great experience for an affordable price!",,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-11-08,"Dear Guest...

Merrie T,5,,2015-11-30,COUPLES,2015-11-20,5,Terrific hotel close to transit,"I absolutely recommend this hotel to travellers to L.A.  It is three metro stops to downtown Hollywood, near a couple of grocery stores, and close to plenty of restaurants.  We were able to travel to the hotel from Union Station via local transit for the princely sum of $1.75 each and used the local metro to travel back and forth.  It was great.

 It is an older hotel but kept in great shape and is very nice inside. The free breakfasts are a bonus - a chef will make eggs for you or you can have a choice of cereals and pastries, fruit, meats - all sorts of yummy food to start your day. 

If you check Google Street View for the area, you do see one rundown spooky looking building down the street - but it's just a place that's gone out of business and the neighbourhood is fine - we walked to and from the metro day and night with no issues - there's lots of places open in the evening so it's not deserted or scary.

We booked directly on the hotel's website and were able to take advantage of a discount offered to international travellers.  

By all means, consider the Hollywood Hotel for your next stay in LA.  I'll certainly stay there again should I go for another visit.  I liked the easy access to cheap transit since I'm not that crazy about driving  cars in strange cities.",We were on the first floor adjacent the courtyard and bar - had no noise issues or other problems.,,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-11-07,"Dear Guest...

Aimée B,9,"Edmonton, Canada",2015-10-31,COUPLES,2015-11-18,5,Everything was perfect and breakfast was amazing!,"The value that we got out of staying at this hotel is mind-blowing!  You get free breakfast, and not just any free breaky, this one is special!  It includes fresh made to order omelettes, and waffles (blueberry, plain or gluten free!) There's also fresh sausages and tater tots!  Its like no other free breakfast I have ever seen.  Sonia the chef was so nice to us and made our mornings magical with her smile and skill!  The maids were all very friendly and the front desk staff was as well. We rented a car from the front desk and went to six flags, it was so fun!  The pool area was great and we spent a lot of time lounging down there.  This hotel is just a 10 minute walk to Los Feliz, a really cool little village with cute restaurants, book and clothing stores and a vintage movie theatre.  If you keep walking you can go up the Hollywood Hills and watch the sunset from the Observatory or go watch a concert at The Greek Theatre!  We did, it was awesome.

The hotel seemed nice and it came with free breakfast, great internet connection, romantic lightings and great view of the city. 

Although, I wouldn't recommend using the Car Hire service there as we had to pay for hidden fee and it ended up being quite expensive.

davidson3910,10,"Auburn, California",2015-11-30,COUPLES,2015-11-16,4,Very Nice Hotel,"My wife and I stayed here on an overnight stay on our way to San Diego.  I researched the reviews online and found this hotel.  Many of the reviews mentioned that the neighborhood was sketchy.  There were many other reviews, however, that were good.  I decided to take a chance.  I was not disappointed.  The facilities were impressive.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  Everything was clean.  The room itself was on the small side.  The only thing we didn't like was that this room was right off the lobby.  Seriously, we walked out of our room and up to the front desk.  We were a little worried that it would be loud and not very private.  We didn't hear any noise or anything, so it was fine.  

We arrived late at night and didn't have any problems with the neighborhood.  In fact, purely by chance, a friend notified us she had to go to the emergency room at the hospital down the street.  We walked the four blocks to visit her at 10:00 PM and weren't worried or uncomfortable at all.  Just like any destination, you need to be aware of what's around you and be cautious.  Other than that, it was find walking outside at night.  The parking facilities were nice and spacious.  Easy to find and close to a lot of things, although we were only here for a short time.  But I would go back.",Don&#39;t stay on the first floor.  We were too close to the lobby.,,3.0,,4.0,,4.0,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-11-07,"Dear Guest

Staff friendly, helpful, hotel very clean, roomy, bathroom huge in one of our rooms.  Supermarket, post office, take away stores a one minute walk down the road.  Metro rail a five minute walk across the road, took us to Hollywood/Universal.  Included in the tariff breakfast was delicious, freshly made omelettes and waffles to your requirements. Plus the usual toast, cereal, juices, fruit platters and pastries.  Filled us up most days that we barely needed any lunch. Thanks Sonia and Hugo - the breakfast team. We also had Happy Hour from 5 -7pm one of the nights, which included cheese platter and dips in the lovely courtyard area. Kids used the pool and we also used their laundry facilities too.  People do say the neighbourhood is a little unsafe, but we didn't feel this during the day.  Probably take caution if walking around the neighbourhood at night, like anywhere really.  Well priced for our families.","Book early, we got a huge bathroom and request a non smoking room if required",4.0,4.0,,3.0,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-11-07,"Dear Guest

Bad----service at front desk at check in very non accommodating. $30 charge for early check in. While waiting someone else was complaining and wanted to speak to the main hotel manager.At 3 pm multiple cleaning carts in hallway still cleaning rooms.Wifi slow.Air conditioning weak and noisy as well as bathroom fan which is tied to the light. Chipped bathroom door, chipped bathroom wall tiles and some wallpaper starting to peel. Asked for maintenance to come up to improve operation of air conditioner and no one came.
Good---room spacious, balcony overlooking attractive courtyard. Appetizers and bar in courtyard at 5 pm. Inside bar supposed to be a comedian most evenings but never checked it out. Sauna on every floor (have to make an appointment), Small exercise room. Great breakfast included with eggs prepared the way you like or omlettes, waffles, cereal, oatmeal (you microwave), croissants and pastries and more.

The hotel was in a convenient location when I wanted to do sightseeing. I went to the walk of fame, Malibu, and other places and it didn't take us too long (even in LA traffic!) I would ABSOLUTELY recommend renting a car . We only spent a hundred bucks for a 2015 sedan at a local car rental place. It saves you tons of money in the long run, even with the parking fee at the hotel. Back to the hotel, the beds were so comfy. Hotel was very nicely maintained and the pool was a bonus! The complimentary breakfast was amazing. If you want an omelet they have someone cooking it fresh in front of you , yum! I have nothing negative to say, staff was extremely friendly and accommodating, only con was the wood floor in the room that left your feet dusty but just wear socks or slippers in the room and you'll be fine.

Had a small issue with someone one night when I was outside on the hotel driveway but the front desk and cops dealt with the matter quickly and efficiently. My room was standard when I bought it but it seemed way bigger in there, very please! No locks on the bahroom but that wasn't an issue for myself but could be for other guests I suppose.. Michael on the front desk was very friendly and professional, anything I needed he helped as quickly and thoroughly as he could. Another front desk lady with cult brown hair (sorry I can't remember your name) was amazing and really helped me out when it ca,e to directions and tourism questions.  Close to most attractions; as I don't drive, getting to Marina Del Ray was a bit of a way. Breakfast was lovely and a really good standard considering its complimentary..

Daril P,1,"Seattle, Washington",2015-09-30,COUPLES,2015-10-27,1,Worst Managment and Front Desk Service. These people are Crooks!,"I stayed at Hollywood Hotel IN VERMONT LOS ANGELES CALIFORNIA from Tuesday 9/9/2015 and departed Friday 9/11/2015. Upon checking in my fiancé and I were greeted by Michael (Front Deck). He informed us, their parking during our stay, it was $22/day for the 3days ($72). I pulled out an envelope with cash & gave him $100. He gave me a yellow parking slip & told me to fill out the bottom of the slip, he tore the top portion off & handed the slip to me. He also mentioned though we had payed for our stay in advance, we would need a credit card to put down a deposit on our room, and the money will be released after. We accepted. Upon arrival to Washington (my Home state). I received an ""OVERDRAFT"" warning on my statement.I called the Hotel on Monday 9/14/15 and askedto speak with the Manager, Cecilia.I explained to her how everything went about when we first checked in, and how appalled we were because we felt as if the hotel is trying to SCAM us. She said she would look into it and call us back.I called the hotel Again since we did not hear back from the MG. This time Michael answered. He first acknowledge he remembered talking to my fiancé., then started arguing with me. Michael finally admitted he did remember me giving him $100 bill, but said I gave it to him to pay for my deposit for my three night stay. Michael then stopped arguing with transfered me to Cecilia's Voicemail. He was very rude and I believe the only reason why he stopped arguing with me was because he noticed I noticed he was lying to me. AFTER RECIEVING OUR, MY FIANCE RECEIVED A PHONE CALL FROM CECILIA (THE MANAGER) THE FOLLOWING WEEK. SHE TRIED TO BE NICE AND TRIED OFFERING US A DISCOUNT TO THE HOTEL FOR OUR NEXT VISIT. AT THIS POINT WE REALIZED WHAT A “RUN DOWN” OF A PLACE WE HAVE GONE TO. THERE WILL NOT BE A NEXT TIME FOR US. THE MANAGEMENT WAS LOW CLASS AND CROOKS JUST OUT TO GET YOUR MONEY ANY CHANCE THEY GET. I JUST HOPE OTHERS DON’T HAVE THE SAME EXPERIENCE I DID, AND REMEMBER TO KEEP ALL OF YOUR RECEIPTS BECAUSE THE MANAGEMENT HERE WILL BELIEVE THEIR MINIMUM WAGE WORKERS MORE THAN THE GUESTS PAYING FOR THE JOB THEY HAVE.",,,1.0,,3.0,3.0,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-10-10,"Dear Guest

Z_1000000000,83,,2015-10-31,FRIENDS,2015-10-23,5,Amazing,"Absolutely loved the hotel. Read mixed reviews before we went so was a bit worried but it turned out we had nothing to worry about. 
The rooms are massive, the bed is so comfy, the bathroom is amazing and the shower is out of this world. We had a balcony which was nice. 
The pool area is lovely and relaxed, very clean and you need your room key to get through the gate so very safe, there's also ample towels in the pool area to use and also a water dispenser.
The staff were all lovely and helpful.
They have complementary nibbles in the court yard from 5-7pm most evenings which was nice and relaxed.
Breakfast is complementary, it was nice but being from England we missed being able to have a brew and bacon etc as it was omelettes and pastrys etc but still nice and served from 6.30-10.30am.
Location wise we got a cab to most places, I would recommend using Uber over the taxi service the reception booked for you they quoted us 25 dollas to the Griffth Observatory and in the end we downloaded the uber app and got one for 6 dollas. We also got around town using uber.
There is also a small shop on site selling water, snacks etc the man who works there is lovely and very helpful. 
There is on site laundry facilities as well $7 in total for a full wash and to use the dryer which took a total of 1hr 20 altogether, perfect. 
I felt the area was safe the metro is 2 mins walk away and there is a large 7/11, subway, and danysdeli  (which is so cheap and very tasty) all in about a 3 min walk from the hotel. 
Very happy with out stay and would defiantly come again",,,,,,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-12-18,"Dear Guest,

Clean and fairly-well maintained although there was some damage to the wall in our room.  Nice outdoor pool area, and outdoor court area in the middle of the hotel.

nicole b,21,"Brisbane, Australia",2015-10-31,FAMILY,2015-10-14,5,Wonderful hotel.,"We have just stayed for 5 nights at Hollywood Hotel and would thoroughly recommend the hotel to fellow travellers. It is a reasonable rate, well located to transport - a block away from the Red line subway which takes you to many attractions eg Universal studios, Walk of Fame. Bus stop around the corner takes you to Santa Monica. All so close.
I found the front desk staff very helpful especially Nancy who went out of her way to help me with whatever help we needed. The buffet breakfast was fantastic in a lovely, spacious breakfast room area. Hugo makes wonderful omelettes which my son now loves and I will probably have to make him each morning too :) Waffles were delicious and many other choices on offer.
Rooms were very spacious. we were surprised. Plenty of room for 3 suitcases and the 3 of us to stay. Beds were very comfortable and we were happy they met our request for a non-smoking, pet free room.
We would definitely stay here again and recommend it to our friends and family.

Sara P,3,"Cranston, Rhode Island",2015-10-31,NONE,2015-10-14,1,Better off elsewhere!,"This place was kind of like staying in the Twilight Zone. My time here was pretty bizarre. 

1.) They charge you for everything, like their overpriced parking lot and a lot of other random fees.

2.) The pictures make this place look A LOT nicer. I think they must have like one or two ""updated"" rooms, because this place is kind of scrubby and 80s feeling. 

But, now to the ""bizarre"". Some of the staff members were lovely. But, I had a late check out time, since I was staying for work and wouldn't be available at the appropriate time. To which I got a, ""sure, no problem"". 
Fast forward to 5 o'clock. I'm locked out of my room. They give me a temporary key to pack up my things. But, a few minutes later, they're banging on my door, SWAT team style, saying I have to leave like right then. I was so thrilled to get out of here!

Weird place indeed. You're likely to get way more for your money staying at a Comfort Inn or something. Really. Any chain hotel will give you a cleaner, nicer experience! Save yourself the money and energy.",,,,,,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-10-10,"Dear Guest...

Luke,140,,2015-10-31,COUPLES,2015-10-13,3,Not a bad hotel shame about the area tho..,"Let's start with the negatives, the hotel rooms do feel a little outdated with all the lamps ect. The hotel and rooms were not to bad the only real issues we had were the air conditioning systems being extremely loude. To the point that sleep was difficult, and it wasent jus our room, no 315 it was everyone's, you could hear whenever an air conditioner had been turned on. One of the most uncomftable things would have been the hotel elevators they took about 3 min to get up 3 floors and are are out of date needing to be retested and certified witch I know in Australia is illegal to operate an elivator to the public witch has not been recently tested. However I'm not to sure on the Los Angeles government 

The positives
The checkin staff were great also very helpful whenever you needed directions ect, and the reception area looks great. The best part would be the comlimentary breakfast cooked buy a chef in front of you.

Transportation 
There's a metro train station across the road from the hotel however I do not reccomend using it as it feels extremely unsafe. Not just that someone almost got stabbed infront of us on the train!! I recommend catching a cab wherever you want to go and use the company United taxis. Like most hotels they can call one for you however the ones the hotel uses are not certified buy the city and have no meters in them the driver charged us $30 for a 8 min drive and expected a tip still, not jus that because they are not afficial taxes they drive like idiots and are very dangerous. Do not get in one use United taxis for your own safety. If your after transport to six flags or universal make sure you use a taxi the hotel offered a tour service witch will drop you off but they are very expensive. 

Recomended 
Warner brothers studio tour 
Universal studios 
Six flags magic mountain 
Open bus tours (Google them) 

This hotel offered free wifi however good luck to you if your trying to use it from an apple device.",No good views it&#39;s only 3 floors,4.0,4.0,,,4.0,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-12-18,"Dear Guest

Rachel O,12,,2015-10-31,FRIENDS,2015-10-08,5,Diamond in the not so rough," Everything about this hotel was beautiful! A very warm welcome at check in! We were on the bottom floor on the man corridor so expected lots of noise, but that wasn't the case! The rooms were gorgeous and cleaned everyday with fresh towels. Very comfortable and if there was a need to stay in your hotel room for a length of time then it wouldn't have bothered me. 

After reading some of the reviews on trip advisor, after I had already booked this hotel for myself and my friends I was very dubious about the area and feeling unsafe.. Some reviews even said ""don't go out after dark alone"" or ""it's very unsafe"". Well I have to say I never once felt unsafe and even though I didn't go out on my own I couldn't imagine that other than using your common sense and been very aware of your surrounding (which everybody should be in a unfamiliar area) that anything bad would happen to you. 

If you choose to stay at The Hollywood Hotel you are exposed to nothing but first class customer service and are made to feel very welcome! Five stars without the price tag! If you don't have a car then the metro link is just outside or reception would be more than happy to ring a taxi for you! The local bars were a surprise, very lively and fun or it's a 20 dollar ride to sunset strip.

The little shop that is on site is a little cave of goodies with a lovely man who will guide you on the best places to go and show a genuine interest in who you are, he becomes the first stop in the morning before you head out to sight see because you know he will give you the best advice on where to go and how to get there that gives you the best view of the city.

The breakfast is beautiful every morning... With a choice of the usually breakfast things! 

Didn't spend much time using the facilities such as the pool, spa and gym but all looked very good! Used the pool once and well... It's was a pool! It was clean that's all that matters! The seating and lounge area was kept clean and tidy and the whole area was gated and locked with access by card key.

I could gush on about this hotel all day and will be recommending it to everybody I speak to. Will be returning to this hotel in the near future to continue my sightseeing of Los Angeles. Thank You Hollywood Hotel! ",,,,,,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-12-18,"Dear Guest,

Rob S,47,"Croydon, United Kingdom",2015-09-30,FRIENDS,2015-10-07,4,Very pleased with the room for the price I paid,"I was on a day trip to California, and just needed somewhere inexpensive but decent quality to stay for the night, and this place seemed to fit the bill.

I wasn't pleasantly surprised by the size of my room, it was quite large, and included a separate seating area and table as well as the bed, and was decorated quite well and kept clean. The bathroom was a little bit small, and some of the wallpaper was peeling off the walls a bit, but it was perfectly functional. 

The hotel is situated on a busy road, but I didn't hear any noise in the evening, and was able to get a decent nights sleep.

I also had a good breakfast in the morning.

I can't comment on the area the hotel is situated in, as I didn't really explore that.

Kevin H,460,,2015-09-30,NONE,2015-10-03,3,Wasn't what I expected but will do,"Let's start off with saying that Hollywood hotel was not what it was made out to sound like. Location-wise, it was close to the metro red line station and various buses but the nearby area did made it feel like I was in a run down neighborhood.

My towels had some hair and an unknown black stain on it. The decor on the inside of the hotel was kind of dreary and dark. I was expecting a much more grand hotel for the actual price they listed per night; good thing I only paid $30 per night thanks to Orbitz! We requested for a courtyard facing room and didn't have any problems getting it. It was on the first floor so we have direct access from the room to the courtyard. Haven't used the Wifi much but the speed seems to be decent.

One redeeming quality was the breakfast. They have actual chefs making you omelets, eggs and hash browns which were a little mashed/mushy. Would I stay here again if I'm in the area? Maybe if the price was right.",,,,,,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-12-18,"Dear Guest,

CaliforniaDreamin77,9,"Los Angeles, California",2015-09-30,FRIENDS,2015-10-02,3,Average Hotel,"This Hotel is located in East Hollywood and is suitable for families visiting the area. We stayed one night here and it was just OK. The rooms were clean, however, there was an incident at the breakfast buffet that left a bad taste in my mouth. A young mother with several children sat at the table next to us. One of the children spilled juice while the mother was at the buffet station getting their food. I told someone working in the dining area about the spill, and he ignored it. Not only did he walk past the spill countless times, but even after having it brought to his attention he did nothing.

At least put up a ""caution, wet floor"" sign or something! Or better yet, clean it up! Anyone could have slipped on it, not to mention the children had to sit in that mess for their entire meal. That REALLY put me off. The hotel itself is OK, the rooms were clean, the breakfast was average. The smoking area in the back is literally right next to the entrance and the area reeked of smoke. No one should have to walk through a mushroom cloud of 2nd hand smoke just to get inside. They could easily move the smoking area further away from the door in the parking lot. 

The area can be seedy at night, so don't plan on taking any evening strolls.",,,3.0,,2.0,,3.0,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-12-18,"Dear Guest,

The gentleman that first helped us at the front desk was Nelson and he was very nice and very accomodating. When we finally came back to check-in there was a huge issue which Mikey was happy to help us with yet Michael G. couldnt be bothered with. After a half hour of trying to check-in we finally were able to get our bags and the gentleman that helped us with that was George! I commend him and all that he does! Had it not been for George we would have probably checked out the next day, he was the kindest Front Desk Service Representative I've ever dealt with but even moreso at this hotel. He was more of a right-hand and definitely more helpful with our questions and more accommodating than the ""manager"", Gisele.

What an unexpected surprise. The location is just fine.  We even brought our little old dog who had to go outside a couple of times during the night and I felt just fine.  It is a very public street and well lit.  If you have a pet, there is a $30 charge they don't advertise.  The parking was gated and very nice, but does cost $25, so the additional charges brings the room rate up to comparable hotels listed in area searches.  Our room was very nice, ground floor with view of the courtyard..  The bed was wonderful and  appreciated the tile floors over old carpet. There is a pool off to the side of the hotel and of course, then there is the breakfast that everyone posted a comment on.  I thought that the free breakfast was great because maybe they gave you a hard boiled egg.  No, this was a full breakfast with omelettes made to your liking, waffles, European style cereals and meats and cheeses. Yumm!  The ladies at the front desk helped us with directions and even programmed my Garmon for me when we were running late for a concert couldn't find a particular venue.  They were so nice.

The neighborhood is not the best, lots of homeless and drug addicts hang around about two blocks away. But, the hotel grounds are immune to that. If you walk towards the hospitals and Griffith park, it's relatively nice with more of that ""Hollywood"" feel. We walked back to the hotel from the Hollywood Walk of Fame with a 4yo, and felt save. There is a large secure parking lot for a fee, and it's close to public transit.

Moknop,8,"San Diego, California",2015-09-30,COUPLES,2015-09-13,4,Better than expected and will return,"After I booked a non-refundable stay at Hollywood Hotel to attend a concert up the road at the Greek Theatre, I started to read the bad reviews and panicked. I usually read the reviews and THEN book but I was excited to go to the show with my love and jumped-the-gun. So after reading the bad reviews, I psyched myself out and then psyched out my companion before we got there thinking that we were going to a cheesy motel in a terrible neighborhood with rooms covered in cockroaches. 

None of that were true. It's not a bad neighborhood (anymore), the hotel is very convenient to the Greek Theatre and Griffith Park/Griffith Observatory. Checking in was convenient and quick and the lobby was tasteful and updated. The staff were all extremely polite and nice. 

Our room was small but very nicely done, clean and comfortable. It overlooked the courtyard that is very attractive and decorated as the professional pictures depict. Our room was very quiet despite being across from one of the elevators. 

We arrived just after the complimentary cocktails and appetizers were offered so I'm not sure if it happened or what, but it looked like a nice perk. 

In the morning, I went hunting for the complimentary breakfast and after asking how to get there, I went to the basement where the elevator opened up to a very large, very well-done eating area. Breakfast was a staffed omelet bar, cereal, bread/toast/bagels, sausage, potatoes. The food was tasty and fresh. I was very impressed. 

I don't normally write reviews but after reading the bad reviews on this hotel and psyching myself out about it, I wanted to write something about how pleasantly surprised and pleased I was about my stay. I will absolutely stay there again. And hopefully before cocktail hour ends. 

One thing they can improve would be to have the staff know a little more about where to eat, shop, etc., in the neighborhood. However, they were very nice and very attentive. 

It loses a star for the small rooms and confusing layout but that's nothing that really can be helped other than tearing the whole thing down. They did a great job with what they have. Very nice.",,,5.0,,,4.0,5.0,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2018-11-05,"Dear Guest,

Dorothy S,86,"Los Angeles, California",2015-09-30,COUPLES,2015-09-12,4,A clean getaway with a fantastic patio and phenomenal breakfast included!,"We stayed here just last weekend - Labor Day - for a ""staycation"" in town.   (thank you Grandma for babysitting!!)   Checked in at 5 and immediately headed to the patio, where we were greeted by the lovely Mandy, who quickly served us glasses of wine, while we stuffed our plates full of olives, hummus, chips/salsa, cheese, and other fresh appetizers.  She refreshed them several times, and as we relaxed in the serene, comfortable Mediterranean like patio, we finally felt like a holiday!   The room/environs are clean, but nothing fancy, but the patio is truly lovely.    After a nice sleep, we awakened to breakfast (continued kindly until 10:30 am, to allow a nice sleep-in).  I had heard the breakfast was great, and this did not disappoint!  Made to order omelettes, muffins, waffles, coffee, several kinds of fresh juices, yogurt, fruit  - this fit the bill!  We arrived at 10:15 and it was still nicely stocked and the place packed!   Overall, this is a great bargain hotel for families (there is a pool), travelers (we met several Europeans in town), and those just visiting Hollywood or needing a night out.   Tons of restaurants nearby, and a great breakfast to nurse any hangover!   Overall, thanks to Mandy and all the staff for a nice night.",rooms facing the courtyard would definitely have a pretty night view,,5.0,4.0,,,4.0,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2018-11-05,"Dear Guest...

zavcwu,95,,2015-07-31,FAMILY,2015-09-12,1,unpleasant one-week stay at Holllywood Hotel,"I have stayed in many hotels (from youth hostels to 5 stars hotel), so far Hollywood Hotel is the worst place I ever stayed considering the price I paid.  
      Pro: I chose this hotel because of its central location since we wanted to visit Universal Studios, Paramount Studio, Six Flags Magic Mountain and the Chinese Theater.
      Con: 1.  indifferent and unfriendly staff.  Vending machine went out of bottles of water once and we told the staff.  Nothing happened.  My parents-in-law went to the front desk and asked if they sell water at the front desk, she was told ""no"".  But the next week my husband did buy some water from the front desk.  ATM was broken so we informed the staff, nothing happened again.  We spent one week at this hotel so we have seen a lot of staff but just one worker there was friendly.  
    2. miserable cleaning/room service: Over the 8 days we spent at Hollywood hotel, not once did we have our toiletries renewed.  The room / bathroom was never throughly cleaned.  Once they even forgot to give us clean towels.  
    3. room in bad shape: the bed is quite small for 2 persons.  The door frame is rusty.  Air conditioner did not work properly so either it was too cold or you had to turn it off.  We (9 persons) have stayed in this hotel in 3 rooms.  All 3 rooms have the same problems.
    4. breakfast: the choices are very limited.  The staff is always in a hurry.  Sometimes they took our plates away even though we were still eating which is quite rude.
    Considering the prices we paid (200 US Dollars pro day, my parents-in-law 300 USD since they only stayed during the weekend),  this hotel is definitely the worst one we have stayed.",,,1.0,3.0,3.0,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-10-10,"Dear Guest...

C C,1,"North East England, United Kingdom",2015-08-31,FRIENDS,2015-08-24,4,Clean hotel disappointing breakfast,"Positives:  
Having read other reviews I was aware this was an older hotel, however, I found it very modern and nicely decorated in the reception and dining area.  Our room must be one of the recently updated one's as this was also very modern, clean and tidy.  The bathroom was also modern and tidy.  

The location is near to bus stops to get to the tourist attractions and the beach.  We also walked to some restaurants up the road (about 10 minute walk) with a very nice Italian restaurant and a Pub with good food too.  

All the staff on the reception I encountered were very helpful and polite.  

Negatives:
I understand people like the ice machine (which was right outside our room) as it was clearly visited every night (when we were asleep!), however, it was VERY LOUD and would probably be better placed in the reception area away from the rooms.  

It was disappointing that the beautiful courtyard area was rarely open.  

The issue I had was with the breakfast.  We would go down to breakfast around 9ish (so we weren't first or last) and they would run out of food on many occasions.  I found this hard to understand as from what I saw people weren't eating or wasting huge amounts of food.  It was as if they never ordered enough food.  People would ask if there were any more croissants or fruit and they would just say ""No"".  For 3 days in a row they had run out of Soya milk, I thought fair enough for one day but surely if you know you have run out you will definitely buy some more for the next day.  So I had no cereal for 3 days and then in the end I bought some from the shop RIGHT ACCROSS THE STREET.  I'm not sure what the people who had breakfast after us then had to choose from.",,,3.0,,4.0,5.0,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-12-18,"Dear Guest,

Tyler C,3,"Calgary, Canada",2015-07-31,COUPLES,2015-08-21,1,"Useless staff, unsafe location","My girlfriend and I booked a vacation package through Expedia and stayed at the Hollywood Hotel for 6 nights in July. We were very excited, as we had read generally positive and favorable reviews about the hotel, and it was our first time in LA.  To be blunt, we were startled at the disappointing and negative experience we had at the Hollywood Hotel. A warning to fellow travelers - STAY AWAY FROM THIS HOTEL.  The Hotel Manager, Cecile Augenia, and the Hotel Director, Jeff Zarrinnam were both completely negligent.

 

I've never complained at a hotel or posted on a public site before, but this experience needed to be shared -

·         The exterior of the hotel is NOT accurately represented in the online photos. The outside of the hotel is run-down, dated and unkempt.  The hotel is located close to transit, but in an unsafe and transient area – not recommended for tourists!

·         The hot water in the bathroom was very inconsistent and often cold. We had to run the water for 10 minutes to get it to even a luke-warm temperature, and this was almost every night.

·         The room finishings were of very poor quality and seemingly dated standards. The walls were paper-thin, and you could hear everything around us, including the hotel staff. 

·         The towels, toilet paper and another amenities were super poor quality, especially considering the price point of the hotel.

·         When we arrived, there were only 6 hangers in the room, so we called down to the front desk to request additional hangers, and these were never delivered.

·         When out swimming in the pool, there were two guests – myself and another guest – who called the front desk to seek more towels for the pool. I was soaking wet and didn’t feel it was appropriate to go into the lobby dripping wet, or else I would have had no hesitation.  Then my boyfriend went in-person to ask, and was told “we will see what we can do”.  In total, there were eight guests who had no towels, and walked through the hotel soaking wet, past the front desk, to no reaction of the staff.

·          We woke up Tuesday morning to find a massive and startling INFESTATION OF ANTS all over the side dresser of our room. We had left out a souvenir donut from Universal Studios, for only a few hours, and it appears to have attracted a huge quantity of ants to this area of our room. 

·         The way the hotel management and director dealt with this issue was totally negligent.

·         The supervisor was nice, but was clearly flustered, and made it clear she was unable to do much, other than defer this issue to the manager. 

·         I was assured repeatedly that the Hotel Manager, Cecile Augenia, would come to our room at 9AM the following morning, and we could speak in person and address this issue.  Following this, she indicated housekeeping would be sent to the room asap.  The housekeeper arrived one hour later, and we were obviously frustrated with the lack of urgency for a relatively small hotel.

·         The Manager did NOT show up at 9:00AM the next day, so I went down to the front desk. We were led to the Managers office, where she apologized for the delay, saying she had other priorities (!!?). She has no answers and offered no value, other than to apologize and to indicate she herself would escalate this to the Director.

·         We did not receive any follow-up communication from the Hotel Director, Jeff Zarrinnam, not even a phone call!  Therefore, I called and emailed the Director, outlining our issues and requesting a response.  He has NOT responded, showing no concern for the integrity or reputation of his hotel.    

·         To be honest and fair, the breakfast chef was very kind and attentive, and was the only positive aspect of our hotel experience.  He was the best part of the hotel!",The alley is cleaner,1.0,1.0,,1.0,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-10-10,"Dear Guest...

Alexandra C,8,,2015-08-31,FRIENDS,2015-08-18,1,The world's worst hotel.. Ever.,"I travel often and never have I been so dissapointed in the service I've received. If it were possible let to give this place a 0 rating that's what it would get. 

To start in day one we had ants in our room. They were in out clothes, our electronics, Be sheets and bathroom. EVERYWHERE. We complained, then transfered to another room. The following night we had Cicero aches in the room!! 

We had called the front desk and they had someone come and remove it. At which time we were fed up and have decided to speak to management (CFDR Accountant) who told us that she won't give us a refund or compensation of any sort. Later that night we were also told that we were lying about the bugs. 

The following day we slept in the car as the hotel was so nasty!! We went to talk to the reservations manager and he had said that he's seen the pictures and knows the situation but as we've already posted pictures we ""might as well finish it"". 

This hotel and vacation experience has been the worst of my life time. DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL. There are many other reviews that say there are many other types of bugs and no other accommodations will be made. 

Bug pictures posted with this review.

I am not someone who would generally review a hotel but this is the worst accommodations AND customer service ever. Save yourself the trouble.

I am very glad to read you have recovered and obviously very concerned about your comments. Our hotel does have an aggressive pest prevention process and we do take your incident seriously. Fortunately, our pest control contractor found no activity in the room you were originally assigned to. Although we did not find any activity we still treated the room as well as the surrounding rooms as a precaution

Thank you for your business and feedback

EW_Nocona,95,"San Marcos, Texas",2015-08-31,COUPLES,2015-08-16,4,The GREAT and not so great at the Hollywood Hotel,"After moving our daughter to LA, we stayed and played for a few days at the Hollywood...The GREAT.  Loved the location wrt proximity to what we did...easy (well as easy as it can get with LA traffic) to get to places like the zoo or the observatory, etc.  Loved the hotel set-up...nice sized rooms, clean, pool is wonderful and in its own little semi-private court-yard...you forget its next to the parking lot.  Our room was second story overlooking the street, but still quiet enough for sleeping.  I'm thinking the rooms overlooking the inner courtyard are even better, and that's what we will request next time.  The morning breakfast is fab, as it includes 'eggs made to order' and Special shout-out to Sonia!!!! who was wonderful fixing my omelet just how I wanted every day, but more than that, made us feel soooo welcome.  All the staff were pleasant and good to deal with....a big reason we'll be back.
The not so good....no consistent hot water for the shower, meaning it took a long time to arrive, and then would come and go...and really wasn't so hot.  Since it was LA in the summer, this was not a big deal, but could be in the winter.  Also not so good is there are no decent restaurants or bars/pubs within walking distance that are open late.  Plenty of lunch-type eateries to walk to during the day, but we checked in late and just really wanted a couple of drinks and some type of pub-grub we could walk too.  Now, further north up the street, ~3-4 miles(?), are some very nice places, but we didn't discover them until the next day, and too far to walk most times.

We will be back!!",2nd story overlooking inner courtyard look to be the best,,5.0,,5.0,,5.0,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-12-18,"Dear Guest,

Amystery1975,12,,2015-07-31,FAMILY,2015-08-15,5,"Excellent Hotel, staff, pool & location!!!","We stayed at the Hollywood Hotel from July 24 to August 4 (11 nights). We couldn't of asked for a better hotel. We were greated by such kind staff working at the front desk. Cecile was the first one we met and she made us feel so welcome. We stayed on the first floor is room 116 (renovated room) with huge shower. The hotel is perfectly located very close to the metro station (Santa 
Monica/Vermont) which was so handy, it brought us to basically everything we wanted to see..the metro pass also works on the bus which is very pratical if ever u get tired of walking. 

The rooms are VERY clean and the hotel provides GREAT maid service. The maids are all so friendly. We always left them a tip, but even without a tip, the rooms are just as clean. 

The whole hotel/grounds are always immaculate. 

The pool oasis is so nice...it was so nice to relax around the pool after a long day of walking. They provide beach towels directly at the pool are. You will need to bring your room key to access the pool area. The pool itself is a grear size, perfect temperature and is very well maintained and clean.

The breakfast at the hotel is very good. A little repetitive for us, as we were there for 12 days.  Hugo the chef, will make your eggs the way you want them, we were never dissapointed- Thanks Hugo :) He also makes great waffles. Sonia that works in the breakfast area is also very kind, she is very attentive go all the guests staying at the hotel and if you need something, she will make sure you get it asap. I gave her what was left of my perfume, and she was so appreciative, what a nice lady - I will miss you Sonia. (She kept commenting on how nice my perfume smelt, so I gave her the rest of my bottle).

We reserve a car with Advance Car Rental (right next to the front desk in the hotel). We received great service by Brian. We rented their Red Ford Mustang and didn't jave any problems with them at all. We have nothing, but good things to say regarding their service or vehicule.

I really appreciate the service I received from Gisel the hotel manager. She always greats you with a smile and she ensures that all your needs are met. The front desk staff really go out of their way to make sure that your stay is more that enjoyable...
With a manager like Gisel, you can't really go wrong, as her main priority is customer service satisfaction; she is excellent at her job, as every cudtomer I saw leaving the front desk is always smilling.

I would recommend this hotel in a heartbeat...what great place to stay. I miss everyone from this hotel. If you decide to book a this hotel, you won't regret your choice!!!!

Thank to all of you at The Hollywood Hotel for making our vacation the best one we had so far. 
You will all be forever in our hearts.

The neighborhood has many stores, supermarkets and drugstores, everything you need.
The room was clean enough with a reasonably price, I have to mention that suggest to re use the towels is a very good way to help  save water, I like that.
One bad thing.... You have to pay for your parking, we heard about parkings in LA, but $22 a day plus another $2 tax ? 
The hotel staff are friendly, sooo in love with breakfast, Sonia was beyond of what you need to feel confortable out of your house, she was very nice and friendly  her ommeletes...wow , out of this world also she gave us some tips about where to go around the area, she made worth the parking fee...i definitly would stay again.",,,5.0,,,5.0,5.0,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-12-18,"Dear Guest,

However the train is right next to the hotel and takes you to downtown or central hollywood (hollywood/highland station) :-) Easy to get to the hotel from the airport via fly away bus/then red line train from union station.

We didn't drive and found reception really helpful when trying to get somewhere on transport. They would print off instructions etc.

Breakfast is very good and part of the room rate so we took advantage most days. Good selection of different whether got or cold.

Locally the nearest restaurants are up on Vermont and around a 15mons walk away but again good selection and nice neighbour. 

The hotel is located very near one of the hospitals which is very sizeable and the streets at night are quite if walking around but we got used to the area.

Reasonable in price, location ok.

Scott P,225,"South San Francisco, California",2015-07-31,FAMILY,2015-08-03,4,Welcome to North Hollywood..Free great breakfast..Pay for your secure parking.,"My family and I decided to spend 5 nights (Sun-Thurs) in LA before our son went back to school. We found the hotel on the web and chose it based on availability,price and location,as we planned two day's at Universal Studio's. We called ahead and asked for a room on a upper floor and facing the court yard. We did get upper floor (2nd),but not facing the courtyard. We had the deluxe room (254). This is the back corner across from the ticket taker before leaving the parking lot. 

We paid for our reservation in advance and were told we were going to have to leave a $100 deposit that would be returned when we check out. But when we checked out we were told that it was just a credit hold and nothing was charged. We were charged for parking at $22 a day plus another $2 tax. We overheard people complaining and the excuse always was the same ""nothing is free in LA"".

Our room was a deluxe and was nice and big. The beds were big and ok,not overly comfortable. Concrete floor with no carpet. TV with basic cable. Towels supplied were for 2 so we needed one more set. Shampoo and basics supplied. 

Breakfast was served every morning from 6:30-10:30. You might even look at it as a trade off for the parking (and it was free!). You can have eggs to order,we had the omelet and the chef did a great job keeping the line going and cooking. You can also have waffles,sausage and potatoes from the same station. There was also sliced fruit,cereal,bagels,sliced meat,toast and danish. Beverages included Milk,coffee,OJ,lemonade and fruit. The OJ tasted a little flat.

We used the pool,sauna and gym, Pool area was nice and was 3 feet to 8 feet. Not terribly big but ok. The sauna you need to make a reservation for (as it is clothing optional) at the front desk. At first we were told you can use it for 30mn. After seeing the sauna had a sign that said allow 30mn to warm up,we asked and then were told by someone else,you get it for a hour not 30mn.

We were surprised that the area was a little grungy and glad they did have a gated area for your car. It was close proximity to major freeways,bus's and the metro ($1 for the card and another $1.75 for a return trip or a 1 day pass for $7). We used it to go to the Walk of Fame and it drops you off right there.

Lastly I'll cover the WIFI. Like most hotels they advertise ""high speed internet"". Your given the password to connect when you check in. There are several hotspots in the hotel and you are told to connect to the one that is closest to your room, We tried that and found when you connect to ""hotel lobby"" it was a quicker and more stable connection. We had no problems with our phones, my laptop connection did drop a few times. My son who had a computer that ran Windows 8 that would not connect at all. The young lady at the front desk volunteered to try to help but admitted she wasn't overly confidant. My son did not want his settings messed with so he went without,  The only questionable aspect was the survey I received from the hotel today that asked about the WIFI service. If we used a Ethernet net cable (not told and could not find a port) or 24/7 telephone tech support,that we were not made aware of either.","Rooms facing the courtyard will be the quietest, Make sure you are not facing the street,",4.0,4.0,3.0,,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-12-18,"Dear Guest,

There was plenty of room to hang my clothes, store my dozens of shoes I brought, and storage for my 3 pieces of luggage.  I loved the fact the flooring was tile.  The last hotel I stayed at had carpeting that was sticky.  So to have a nice clean floor was fabulous. The cooked to order omelets & waffles were awesome.  Everyday the waffle choices changed!  You could order cinnamon apple, plain, or banana waffles along with a side of tator tots and sausage.  A wide variety of cereals, juices  and pastries were also available.

Surprise charged exorbitant $25/day parking rate & was disappointed I didn't spring for Hilton/Marriott. Our queen room was tiny and everything plain white like an asylum. There were ants in my bathroom. No bathroom counter space or dresser drawers if anytime to store 8 days of clothes... Just a rolling luggage rack using up floor space. The free breakfast omlette cook Oralia started my morning off badly when she had no problems understanding ""huevos revueltos"" but served me a burnt omlette three days in a row with a frown. The hotel property/bar is not a fun atmosphere and guests do not interact or socialize.The wifi on the first floor is totally unable to handle the guests. I kindly brought this up to the front desk everyday where I was rather rudely dismissed being told to call a technical support hotline to troubleshoot my iPhone 6 which has no issues ever.

Gotta say that the $22/day parking gets you a guaranteed spot. (We've had issues with space at other Hollywood hotels.

They have a pool but you have to cross the parking lot to get to it. Hmmm

Tub/shower has really low shower head so if you're 6'0"" you're going to not love it.

Every vending machine in the building was empty when we visited. Go see Mike in the gift shop for drinks and a nice conversation.

Probably wouldn't stay here again just because the room rate could get us something more modern and in central LA. That said, the place DOES have character. Must have been THE place 20-30 years ago.

The hotel has a large and beautiful parking lot on the back but you have to pay for the parking. The people in the reception are nice and friendly. The room is spacious and very classic. Beds are super comfortable and the whole experience is spectacular. Every detail in the hotel room is well decorated and designed. What is best of the hotel is they provide free buffet breakfast. The breakfast is not those cheap breakfast you can find elsewhere but those that you will pay $30 per person for.

The beds are outstanding in my opinion.  The staff is very helpful and friendly.  The one thing that makes this a great value as well is their breakfast service.  Eggs cooked to order including omelets.  In a great location with little travel to many of Los Angeles' attractions.

Erin K,5,"Portland, Oregon",2015-07-31,NONE,2015-07-13,2,Disappointing,"Pretentious and commercialized, I didn't get the impression they cared about their guests. Arrived about 45 minutes early and were made to come back later to check in. The room had damaged walls in the bathroom, a broken patio door and ants crawling along the floor. We don't tend to complain about these trifling things. However, be careful if you stay here because they make you sign away all your rights to sue them if anything goes wrong. The pool was nice, but there is a sign above it saying they use cancer-causing chemicals in the water. They take an unannounced $100 ""security deposit"" which they say you might not get back for up to 5 days after you leave. There's a note at reception saying if this causes you to incur overdraft fees then they will not be liable. If you are traveling on a budget that can really impact your trip, it definitely affected ours and next time I'd be sure to stay in one of the many hotels that don't charge this fee. We did enjoy the breakfast, serving staff were lovely.",,,,,,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-12-18,"Dear Guest,

Kirsty R,15,"Essex, United Kingdom",2014-10-31,COUPLES,2015-07-11,4,Great base for exploring LA,"We have stayed in this hotel twice when coming to LA. On both occasions we found this hotel a great base for exploring the surrounding area. We have stayed on a bed and breakfast basis. Breakfast had a good range of cereals, toast, pastries, fruit and some hot options, including omelettes and waffles cooked to order. We did not eat any other meals in the hotel as we were out each day. The hotel had a laundry room which we used. The small swimming pool looked really nice and well kept, although we did not use this facility due to limited time. Rooms were quite small but well equipped with everything that would be expected. Free wifi was included. Staff were friendly and helpful and check in was easy. We had a car for the duration of our stay (not booked through the hotel) and had to pay a daily parking fee at the hotel. I am afraid I cannot remember how much this was , however was informed by other guests at the hotel that this is a standard charge for most hotels in LA. The car park was secure and usually had an attendant. Hotel was easy to find and located close to tourist attractions ( not walking distance , but a short drive) . We would definetly stay here again if visiting LA, if the price remained reasonable.",Room overlooking the inner courtyard was very nice,,4.0,,,4.0,4.0,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-12-18,"Dear Guest,

jidteach,2,"Redlands, California",2015-06-30,FAMILY,2015-07-10,4,"Very good at this price point...any more $, it would just be ok","Pros: outstanding breakfast buffet with waffle/omelet/eggs prepared to your order by chef; lovely older building with a decent renovation; good location; beds and linens are great; pool is nice (even though you have to cross the parking lot to get  to it (?)

Cons: Service was mediocre service at best, and in one instance was unacceptable (more below); wi-fi is slow and difficult to connect to; TV was unusable (for us); building is noisy, but that is what you get for the convenient location; hair in the shower (EEK!!)and parking (if you don't have a deal) adds a lot to the price (over $20 a day).

Review: My son (12 yrs old) and I stayed on a weeknight, and I got a great deal through TripAdvisor ($140 prepaid included all taxes, fees, AND parking for a room with two queen beds). We arrived just after 2 p.m. - check in is at 3 - and were told unceremoniously to come back after 3. Person at the front desk did not check to see if, by chance our room was ready, never even asked our name, even after I asked if there were anything he could do. I found this odd, because other reviews have suggested that the staff were helpful for early arrivals; maybe my experience was unique. 

Everything was okay for parking and getting settled in the room, although when I went down to ask for a room that did not face the street, I was told I could not switch - again, the front desk person (different person) did not look anything up, just said nothing was available. Okay.

We also had some trouble finding the pool; it is outside the back of the hotel and across the parking lot and the front desk did not explain that well at all...made it seem like it was in the courtyard. Still, no big deal, really.

Once we settled into the room, we struggled to get connected to the wi-fi, but finally did. It was slooooooow. Then we tried the TV, which was slower than the wi-fi. Click, pause (two three four), channel change. Ah, whatever, we are not here for the TV or the wifi, right?

By clicking on the flip.me marketing button - and as a result giving them access to all my Facebook information, a marketing treasure trove - I received a coupon that the site said I could use for parking or $15 at the bar or a movie. I went down to the bar at 6:30 just to see what it looked like; there was a nice crowd and it looked like fun. but when we got back from dinner (9ish) and I went down, I was told it was closed for a local council meeting. Whuh? 

Okay, gave out my entire demographic history for a drinks coupon I cannot use, my bad - let's use it for a movie, right? Nope. TV would not work. at all. By this point, I gave up and we went to bed.

In the morning, I went to the front desk, told them about the bar/movie/tv trouble and asked if they would be mice enough to extend our checkout time a half hour (to 11:30) as a courtesy. The front desk person (different one again), after making it seem as if I were asking  for a visit with the pope, said she would. We went to the pool. when we got back to the room at 11:05 to clean up and pack, the key would not work in the door. Our room was on the other side of the hotel, and I had to walk in my bathing suit down to the front desk, where the same front desk person said, with a tone that sounded distinctly accusatory, ""Did you enjoy the pool?"" I reminded her that she had promised to extend our stay, and she said, ""Oh yes. The key automatically won't allow you in after 11."" She did not say, ""I am sorry for the inconvenience,"" or ""I should have attended to that."" I felt like I was imposing, and that I was no longer welcome. I felt, in short, shamed by her. 

Still, breakfast was great!",Face away from the main street (Vermont),,2.0,,5.0,,4.0,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-12-18,"Dear Guest,

Anthony H,14,"Walhalla, Australia",2015-06-30,FAMILY,2015-06-29,4,A nice hotel in a convenient location,"My 13 year old son and myself stayed at Hollywood Hotel on our recent four night stay in LA.
We had a second floor room overlooking the courtyard, so the room was very quiet with no traffic noise. The room itself was well fitted out, and also had a nice balcony. My only suggestion here was that a room safe would have been useful.
The reception staff were all very friendly and helpful, and the reception was open 24 hours, so no issue with an early check-out for our flight.
The complimentary breakfast was a great start to the day with eggs and waffles cooked to order by friendly and efficient staff, and a well stocked buffet.
Unfortunately our time in LA was so busy we didn't have time to use the pool or other facilities, so I couldn't comment on these.
The location is very convenient, only a few minutes walk to the Vermont/Santa Monica subway on the Red Line, so very convenient to get to Downtown, Universal Studios or Hollywood Boulevard (we used $8 day passes for unlimited travel).
We felt very safe in the neighbourhood walking to and from the good selection of nice restaurants to the north (5-10 minute walk) and the subway to the south.
We also had a rental car, and used the on-site parking ($24 per night), however there did look to be other street parking options for those who might see this as an unnecessary expense. Location was convenient to freeways for our trips to Disneyland, Santa Monica and the airport.
All in all, a great hotel - just a shame we didn't have an extra couple of days in LA!!

The hotel also features a lovely courtyard and a gym. Unfortunately we never had the time to enjoy it but maybe another time...

The hotel is not situated in a fancy area but the location is great!! Very close to the subway which brought us to the Hollywood walk of fame and Universal Studios fast, cheap and easy!! We also took the bus directly to Santa Monica Beach.

missarahbeth,62,"Orlando, Florida",2015-06-30,COUPLES,2015-06-24,3,Not a great neighborhood,"Yes, the Red Line of the subway that will take most LA tourists to where they want to go is close; however, I would still suggest renting a car and paying for the daily parking ($24/day).  Just factor that into your total from the start.  We talked to other guests staying at the hotel and they really wished they had rented a car because the neighborhood is not great to walk in, especially at night, and they wanted the freedom of driving.  We did use Uber once during our stay and it was convenient, so that could be another option for transportation. 

Pros of the room: seemed clean, very large space, refrigerator.
Cons of the room: minimalist decor, seemed cold and stark, no closet door just a rod for hanging, coffee pot wasn't functional because pieces were missing, our balcony overlooked the parking lot and a not-so-great strip of stores across the street (ask for courtyard view if possible)

Some other positives: The pool was nice and towels were provided. The breakfast and those serving it were a great highlight.  The parking attendant was always polite.

Despite requesting a quiet room at booking, we were placed on the noisier side and had the hassle of moving after the first night. Across the board the customer service was not great - a general lack of courtesy/desire to help. Our second room was much nicer and quieter. We did not have any issues with cleanliness in either room. 

The breakfast was very nice. The hotel was <5 minute walk to the subway and close to downtown Hollywood.

The slowest elevator in the world. Leave at least 15 mins before to wait for the elevator as it is VERY SLOW. 

Breakfast is ok, omelettes and sausages are the only hot things, everything else is breads/sweets/cheeses and they will charge you if you take anything out.

Super creaky beds. All the patio`s will be locked by evening and only place to get some fresh air is in a small central patio or on the streets.

Overall, very bad experience.",Request extra coffee beforehand. It takes hours to get it to your room,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-10-10,"Dear Guest...

Advantage: Near/Close to Metro LA (if you plan to use transit); Free Wi-Fi, Car Rental services in the lobby (for those wanting to rent a car to roam around); Free complimentary breakfast (cereals, omelettes/eggs customized according to your liking, waffles, assorted fruits, assortment of cheeses, pastries, coffee, juices); gym-fitness room with treadmills. Basic room with private shower and acceptable centralized airconditioner (occupant controlled).

Disadvantage: Charges for self-parking ($ 22.00 + tax per night) even with the rental car or own car; Booking a taxi at the front desk they will ask for $15.00 on top of the actual flat rate (and, worse, the taxi company (I think I remember it's called CA Express) will demand a tip from you-- so better beware NOT to book a taxi with front desk, you're probably better off arranging the taxi yourself or use the Shuttle service/shared vans from LAX with a flat fare and no demand for tip).",,3.0,3.0,,,3.0,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2018-11-03,"Dear Guest,

Hotel staff:
Always smiling and very helpful.

Clean:
Very clean everywhere and beautiful rooms and nice beds.

Breakfast:
Delicious breakfast - all from omelets, scramble eggs to toast, bagels, fresh made waffles, fruits and all kinds of cereals
And the chef in charge of the breakfast was very friendly and always with a smile on his lips

Wi-fi
It just worked no matter where - the lobby, the restaurant, the hotelroom or the pool.

Surroundings:
Very close to all the big 'must see' in Hollywood. And if you don't have a car, the staff help you with alternatives - they offer several guided tours or just transportation (and the prices are reasonable)

Yes - you can hear the traffic at night, but it's a big city - so go figure - of course you can hear the traffic, but it was never an issue to us.

Parking:
A very nice and secured parking lot.

To sum up:
We had a wonderful stay here in Hollywood Hotel and we will recommend this Hotel to everybody

bigcars,3,"Riga, Latvia",2015-05-31,COUPLES,2015-05-27,5,Excellent Value,"My wife and I have just completed a 3 week stay and really enjoyed our time at the Hollywood Hotel. It was perfect for us in many ways, especially at the price. In fact, I'm amazed at just how much we got for our money....a good quality hotel experience at a lower price than most other hotels and even some motels we had considered and the excellent complimentary breakfast added even more value! 

In addition, the staff were all very pleasant and helpful and the central location and proximity to the freeway suited us very well as it made it easy for us to plan trips to various locations across LA County and even further afield.

Our room was large, clean and well equipped, having both a fridge and microwave, (which came in very useful), a decent (at most times) WiFi signal, plus a good quality flat screen TV that carried a wide selection of channels. Beyond these in-room amenities the hotel also provided all the facilities that anyone could reasonably expect, including pool, steam room, laundry, bar/entertainment and a gym.

It was important to me that the hotel had a car park as there was no way I wanted to try and find street parking for every one of our 21 nights. Instead I got to pull into a large, well lighted and secure parking lot, in which I never had any problem finding a space. I know some have commented on the price, but it seemed about the going rate when I was researching where to stay and although some motels were offering free parking, I understand that their lots tend to be much smaller and getting a space is not guaranteed. Anyway, I was happy to pay the charge, considering the savings I made on not having to buy breakfast x2 every morning and the great room rate I got.

I've already recommended the Hollywood Hotel as an ideal base to family looking to visit LA and my wife and I plan to stay here again too.","Our room was outward facing and on the third (top) floor, which provided quite a nice view of the Downtown area.

We did not spend much time in our room because we went sightseeing everyday, but we would have been very comfortable spending time in the room. Complimentarybreakfast was offered daily with an Omelette Station. It was yummy:). Hugo was one of the cooks. He was friendly and very helpful. There was nightly entertainment i.e., comedy show, music, etc. I must add that this hotel is located right on a busy street. Therefore, it can be a little noisy. It worked for us because we did not spend a lot of time at the hotel, because we were out sight seeing from 10a to 10p daily. LOL!

It was about the closest we could get. Rooms were updated and breakfast was practically made to order which was awesome. Keep an eye on the small print when you book. We booked a double bed room not thinking we would have to specify four people. We figured this was common sense for two beds but ended up paying more for the mistake. The conceirege would not honor us anything for the practical mistake and we paid 30 extra per person, 60 more than expected!

The hotel is a former hospital which was converted in 1994.  The woodwork and floors are left over from the hospital days and are still in very good shape. We found between all the old beauty and it's renovation it all fits perfectly.  The beds were wonderful and we had a junior suite which had a lot of room.  Our only suggestion for improvement is to just put up a bar in a dead area to hang your clothes on.  The breakfast included waffles, eggs which included omelettes made to order, fresh bakery, sausage, several kinds of muffins, various cereals, fruit, bagels & bread, potatoes like tatter tots, coffee, orange juice and lemonade, tea and hot chocolate. All served in a large and very attractive Valentino setting.

Thank you so much for writing such a glowing review of our hotel! 

I would however like to clarify on some misinformation about the ""hospital"".  
I have been managing the Hollywood Hotel since January 1994 and it was already a grand hotel for a very long time before I arrived.... But never a hospital.
Also the woodwork and floors have all been installed during my tenure at the hotel and most of the floors have been newly installed.

Again, thank you so much for your review, I just had to make this correction for our readers.

We were not given options, we were told that there was hotel recommended tour operation, and took their advice, but it was not up to our expectation. It was not the tour guides fault he did all he was supposed to do, but hotel should give options for guests accordingly like hop on hop off kind of tours.

Williamhi,6,,2015-04-30,SOLO,2015-05-16,3,Not the worst hotel you can find but a total lack of services.,"It's hard writing a bad review of this hotel because most of the staff, except one or two employees at the front desk and some maids, are very nice and willing to help. 
However, the hotel feels somewhat dated. The rooms are not very big in size. The sauna is never heated so don't plan on using them if you're in a hurry (they need a lot of  time to heat....). 
The pool is never heated either so it's very cold most of the time. 
The breakfast is ok, some of it is made to order while pastries are not very fresh. 
Our room was not made for at least three days, apparently the maid ""forgot"", but then when we asked someone if our rooms could be made, we were told that the maids were out at 3pm so the rooms had to stay unmade. This happened way more often that it should've. 
There were four elevators but it took forever to get one (all the more that the employees always took the elevator for the clients and not their dedicated one).

The parking employees were very nice except for one that slept every single time (we had to honk to get out of the parking...)

The showers are very small and dated. If you're tall, you're gonna have problems standing in the shower!

Beware, a lot of the rooms are on the street, ground floor. Ask for a room on the patio. 
The location of the hotel is not the best, it's a 15 min drive to Hollywood and a good hour to Santa Monica. The neighborhood is quite poor, don't go out at night by yourself.",Ask for patio.,,2.0,,2.0,2.0,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-12-18,"Dear Guest,

When we got to the room, my wife asked me to please bring her some wine. The amazing room service said that they hadn't had her kind of spirit here since 1969. The walls in the rooms were thin, because you could hear voices calling from far away. Nonetheless, they really live it up at the hotel.

Breakfast was beyond continental, omelets or eggs in what ever style you want. Hugo, the chef, really had his system down pat, and really knew what was going on in the breakfast line. It was a great way to start the day.
There are water conservation signs everywhere, the hotel does it's best to be echo-friendly.
One problem that I had was that they charge for parking, $17 a day, it was an additional cost that we were not expecting.
We did not find the hotel located in the best of neighborhoods, we did not feel safe walking around in the evening.

Most of the staff vere really nice and helpful. 

But there is something that really irritated me. Under my stay they charged my visa with 560 dollars out of the blue, and when i confronted the staff he told me in a rude way to call my bank, because he didnt know what had happend. 
My bank told me this was normal, and i would get the money back within a week or so.. so i calmed down. When i checked out, the lady in the reseption told me that my deposit would be back in my account in a couple of hours.. This is now 2 days ago and i havent seen the 560 dollars OR the deposit!

Clean fresh linen and towels.
Breakfast is not 5 star but its ok. The toaster is a nightmare takes so long to toast. 
The location is good 10 / 15 mins from most attractions.
Train Station across the road $1.75 to Walk of Fame about 3 or 4 stops and it drops you off in the middle of Walk of Fame strip 
Nokia Centre; Universal Studio, Griffith Observatory 10/15 Mins drive. 
We used Uber ( taxi service) you got to download the app.
They are very very efficient. U blink and they there to pick u up.

The rooms were fresh and clean and the bed was comfortable, the room was noisy though, there is a massive air con unit on the roof outside overlooking the court yard,making noise 24/7!! needed ear plugs to get any sleep and some guests staying there were very loud during the night, with a lot of arguing every night and slamming doors at 3am!! 
But anyway Breakfast was excellent. good variety of food, with selection of cereals, freshly made omelette and eggs, turkey sausage, hash browns, and freshly made waffles which were so lush! blueberry or chocolate waffles so yummy..
Coffee, teas, juice, selection of cold meats, cheeses and pastries as well as muffins to enjoy while the tv's have the morning news on.
The only down side to this hotel was the neighbourhood wasn't the greatest, but during the day and early evening its quite busy out and its right near the subway, so didn't feel to uncomfortable about walking through there, although we didn't go out at night.
The hotel also mucked up our reservations and booking.com had to contact them to sort it as they said we booked to arrive on the monday, when we clearly had the paperwork saying check in was tuesday, couldn't help but get the impression when we arrived that they still thought this no show was our fault!! and they had to refund the no show fee back to our account.
They also had a way over the top ""hold"" against funds on our account, an extra $200 more than the grand total of the room was meant to be!! when we checked in, we wanted to pay with a different card to the card originally booked on so they had this hold on two of our cards, but constantly claimed they were only held on one card. 
We even phoned back to the UK to speak with our bank that confirmed that two large holds were against two accounts from this hotel! not impressed, Some staff are not extremely helpful which is a shame as the hotel looks nice.  thats why they get a star knocked off and because the room was noisy",,,4.0,2.0,,,5.0,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2018-12-07,"Dear Guest,

Breakfast was so so..Bland and the chef gentlemen was horribly rude! No way professional he needs to be shown customer service.

Kevin L,1,"Toronto, Canada",2015-04-30,COUPLES,2015-04-29,2,Bad Honeymoon Experience,"I stayed in this hotel for 1 week in room 209. when I first arrived, my partner and I felt right at home in their comfortable beds, clean rooms. It was a very nice Room. Everything was fine until I went to the hotels restaurant located in the basement. Place was looking nice with a large variety of food, until I saw the fruit, all they had was grapefruit with super thin cut fruit, not very appealing.. in addition, the kitchen is a major problem! I walked over the cook also know as Chef Hugo and I noticed his cooking pan was disgustingly old and dirty, I asked if he ca replace the pan or clean it prior to making my eggs and he refused. I felt disgusted eating from some thing cooked in the pan. I felt afraid for my life and to get an allergic reaction from eating my eggs from those horrifying pans, I hope this place gets the health department to audit their kitchen and make sure they have new and clean equipment, Management needs to be more aware on food is being cooked for the guest.
For me, it only took 1 visit in the kitchen for me not to return, my partner and I ate out for the rest of our start. I do not recommend the kitchen to anyone of want to eat. It may be life threatening to eat of those pans!! Another disturbance to my honeymoon was this little old lady with white hair that walks around the halls early in the morning yelling at the maids and waking people up, which is what she did, woke me up and interrupted my sleep. That rude old lady was yelling at a Maid when she woke me, demanding her to clean the rooms that have the red Do Not Disturb sign. This is completely unethical! I too, had the Do Not Disturb Sign and this old lady opened my door, not respecting my sign! Who does that?!! I asked the maid who that rude woman was, and it happens to be the manager/owner!
This place has really bad management. Do not make the same mistake I did, Do not come to this hotel as this was the worse honeymoon anyone has ever had. The old lady and the kitchen ruined my vacation stay. That was my first and last time visiting California...",Do not choose a room close to the little old lady with white hair.,,1.0,,2.0,,2.0,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-12-18,"Dear guest...

I was there for business and the suite was accommodating, relaxing and had everything they had advertised on their site. It was clean and comfortable. The staff was courteous, attentive and polite.

Kathy W,2,"Winnipeg, Canada",2015-04-30,FRIENDS,2015-04-20,4,Breakfast and common spaces surpass expectations!,"Fresh omelets and waffles, fruit, cheese plate, pastries, cereal, toast and friendly staff ( a great way to start your day). Our balcony wasn't much but there was a lovely courtyard, lounge chairs by the pool and comfortable chairs on the outdoor common balcony at the end of our 2nd floor hotel room. The rooms were clean and the beds comfortable. 

Another great thing to note is that the hotel is located very close to the red line metro which made getting around without a car a better experience than I expected. That one line took us to Hollywood, Universal Studios and Downtown. As well, simple bus routes took us to Paramount Studio, Beverly Hill, The Original Farmer's Market and the CBS Studio.",If you&#39;ve never been a smoker ask if they have any rooms that have only ever been non smoking as the smell still lingers (though opening up the balcony made a significant difference).,,,,,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-12-18,"Dear Guest,

Loopster82,12,"Croydon, United Kingdom",2015-04-30,FRIENDS,2015-04-14,4,"Loved the hotel, but agree with previous comment re Chef Hugo","Overall this hotel was really great - fantastic location, huge room with excellent facilities, lovely pool area, fab sauna. Our overall experience of the staff was also good - reception staff couldn't have been friendlier, excellent housekeeping and the ladies at the breakfast service were fantastic. But I must agree with the previous user's comments re Chef Hugo. I had a very unpleasant experience of him being very rude to me after I'd requested an omelette with primarly egg white but a dash of yolk. They had jugs of both sitting right there so just a case of splashing a bit of yolk in. The woman who was serving on my first morning did it without any problem. But when Hugo served me on my second morning he point blank refused and said it had to be one or the other. I explained I'd had that very order the day before but he refused and continued to be very rude to me. There was a long line of people and it was rather humiliating. I couldn't understand why it was a problem.  It soured my breakfast experience for the rest of my stay! Not a reason not to stay here but hoping the hotel management read reviews and give him some training in good customer service.",,5.0,4.0,,,,5.0,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-12-18,"Dear Guest,

ROC-SD,53,,2015-03-31,FRIENDS,2015-04-03,3,Great hotel for group stay.,"Unfortunately, I dont have photos.

Our scout troop had decided to stay at this hotel for the cost and location. Total of 7 of us (5-girls and 2-adults). 3/29-4/2. Scouting out the location (via google map) and distance to where we were going to be. This location was best for cost and distance. We arrived at the hotel fairly late (10:00pm) since LA is infamous for its traffic. My co-leader checked in and I didnt think she had a problem.  There were no bell hoppers to assist you with your luggage. The girls took their bags and placed them in the rolling cart and rolled the cart themselves. Fortunately, our room was on the first floor. 

Room 130 - was updated. I was pretty impressed. New paint, recessed lights, large new bathroom (no tub).  We were surprised how updated the bathroom.  The design of the bathroom did not have a shower curtain. Which could be a problem for 5-teenage girls who's trying to get ready at the same time. They had a good size counter space. Plenty of towel available. Their fridge temp was really low and took a while to kick in. Flat screen TV with plenty of channels to choose from. Linens looked cleaned. The air, I felt sometimes worked and sometimes it didnt.  It was a dial for this room.  Every time I went in this room, it seemed stuffy. 

Room 128 - was where my co leader and I stayed. The beds were fine and was really comfortable. The size was decent, the fridge didnt seemed like it worked very well. Our bathroom compared to room 130 was dismal.  I didnt take a photo but I think they forgot about this bathroom when remodeling.  Wallpaper had brown spot stains, and was peeling off. Especially under the sink.  Rust stains above the shower stall and certain places. The counter is very small, no place to take your stuff out and get comfortable. After each ritual, we put everything back in the bag because there was no space. The air worked fine for this one. Coffee is awful, we felt like we were drinking flavored water. We skipped out on this, but the single coffee unit was perfect for my co-leaders tea.  

Housekeeping- I do agree with the previous remark. We didnt need housekeeping every day and placed the red tab to notify them we dont need it.  They still cleaned our room.  Did this twice. But when they did. They did a good job.

Breakfast - One of the perks of staying at this place was the free breakfast from 6:30-10:30am. This helped out a lot! They had an omelette station, sausage, tater tots, fresh waffles, all kinds of cereal, juices, bagels, pastries, and fruit.  First off, the omelette station was great.  Your fixings vary from day to day. Sometimes avocado, sometimes bacon bits, or ham. Hugo and Sonia were great.  There are only TWO burners so if you go after 9am, expect a line and can take a while. tater tots are always a hit, the sausage was good (except for one day where it was so dry it was grainy) The fruit was pretty sparse-one day it was just cut bananas. The other days, some cut up grape fruit, or cantalope.  I didnt get any.  Pastries were miniature, bagels and english muffins were fine. Warning.. the coffee was the same as the room.  Flavored water.  It was just too bad, we would of loved to have eaten breakfast with our morning coffee (there is a Sarbucks on Sunset inside a Vons nearby that we visited every morning before our adventures)The selection of items daily is basically the same. So dont expect a big change. Although waffles could change from plain to blueberry or banana. I recommend having breakfast early between 7:30-8:30am. Less people there for the omelette station.

Location (part2) of the hotel, although is close driving distance to everything. Can be intimidating in the evening. We drove to a subway a block away (opened 24-hrs). The guys there were patient, but people came in to panhandle and one person was sleeping in the corner.  Basically, if you want to be able to venture out in the evening from your hotel. This isnt the place to stay. The area can be a bit rough, metro link is across from subway and you have colorful people walking around. Nothing wrong with that, just be cautious of your surroundings. Parking is available with a fee. 

I rate it average. I would stay at this place again, but I would stay in Room 130 if had a choice between the two. It would of been Very Good if our bathroom was updated.",,,,,,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2018-11-06,"Dear Guest.

NZleighm,7,,2015-03-31,COUPLES,2015-04-02,5,Everything you need and more,"My husband and I were pleasantly surprised on arrival at the Hollywood Hotel. It's a pretty big place and is well presented. The lobby is large and check-in was straightforward. Our room was huge. The pool is lovely although the water temperature was rather cold. We loved that they had parking onsite. Yes you have to pay for it but it is convenient and secure so piece of mind on that front. The included breakfast was awesome, a great way to start the day. The breakfast staff (Hugo, Diane) are excellent. The only negative was the elevator was very slow - but that just encouraged us to take the stairs which for us is a good thing.",,,,,,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2018-11-03,"Dear Guest

The rooms are not bad and good comfy bed. I think it stated the pool is heated and it wasn't! But the pool area is nice and great to relax in. 

However... I am giving a lower rating based on the following.

What really annoyed me is the house keeping. I'm not talking about the room cleanliness but the lack of following directions!!! I am the type of traveler how does not need my room to be cleaned everyday which we requested. I hung the little sign indicating no house keeping and since we did no request anyone coming in I did not put anything away assuming no one would come in. When we returned our stuff was moved so that the bed could be made and I happened to leave some change on the counter which the housekeeper took assuming it was her tip! It was only 4 dollars but what if it was 20 or a 100?! Not cool!",,,,,,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-12-18,"Dear Guest,

When I emailed management to let them know my issue I received no response - what terrible service!",,1.0,1.0,,2.0,,,HollywoodHotel1,General Manager,2015-03-31,"Dear Kendall S
Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your stay with us. We value your business and we know you had many hotels to choose from. 

You have covered all aspects of your stay and we feel as miserable as you do about this credit card fraud occurrence as you gave us the lowest score one could possibly give.... Ouch!  This type of fraud has happened to me too in the past but not since I follow the credit / debit card security tips outlined below. Following these tips will help avoid this type of card fraud in the future.  

We are not a 5 Star hotel but a small independently owned family run hotel which is usually to our guests benefit as we are able to respond more quickly to guests needs. I apologize we did not respond to your email in a swift and prompt manner. I wish you had contacted me during your stay as I would have tried my personal best to address the issues quickly to make your stay more enjoyable. 

We are a Hollywood Classic and have been around for a very long time. It is important for Tripadvisor readers to have a pretty good idea of what to expect when they are evaluating hotels in the Hollywood area. We are a small hotel with an inner courtyard. Most of our rooms have a balcony and all rooms have a refrigerator, microwave, hairdryer, flat screen TV and all channels are 100% HD, Sealy Posturepedic Beds with a pillow top mattress for extra comfort. All beds have 300 thread count snow white bed linens with a Duvet comforter. Linens are changed and washed daily. We serve a complimentary hot buffet breakfast with cooked to order omelet’s in our restaurant from 6:30am - 10:30am. Families love us and kids stay and eat free too!

We have taken note of your positive and negative comments and will use these to monitor and improve the quality of services we offer to our guests.

Some Credit / Debit Card Security Tips for the unsuspecting traveler

You rarely let your credit card out of your sight, so how do bad guys get your credit card information? Some may get it from a friend waiting tables at a restaurant, but many credit and debit card thieves get your card info using a device called a Credit Card Skimmer.  Hollywood Hotel does not let your credit/debit card out of your sight at check in to help prevent against this type of back room fraud.

A credit card skimmer is a portable capture device that is attached in front of or on top of the legitimate scanner. The skimmer passively records the card data as you insert your credit card into the real scanner.

Credit card thieves will often temporarily affix the card skimmer device to gas pumps or other convenient self-service point-of-sale terminals. The bad guys like gas pumps and ATMs because they are easy to retrieve their skimmers from and they generally receive a lot of traffic.

Skimmer technology has become cheaper and more sophisticated over the years. Some skimmers capture the card information using a magnetic reader and use a miniature camera to record you typing in your secret PIN number. Some skimmers will even go so far as to place a secondary keypad over top of the actual keypad. The secondary keypad captures your secret PIN number and records it while passing your input to the real keypad.  Hollywood Hotel does not request your PIN number for credit or debit card payments.  In fact we do not even have a PIN input device at the front desk, restaurant or bar/lounge.

Important observation - In order for the bad guys to retrieve a $2500 cash advance as stated in your review they would have needed your secret PIN number.  Since Hollywood Hotel does not have a PIN input device at the front desk, restaurant or bar/lounge, your PIN was most likely not retrieved at the hotel. 

How can you detect and avoid having your credit card skimmed at the ATM or gas pump or anywhere else?

1. Inspect the card reader and the area near the PIN pad
Many banks and merchants realize that skimming is on the rise and will often post a picture of what the real device is supposed to look like so you will see that there is something attached that is not supposed to be there if a skimmer is present. Of course, a card skimmer could put a fake picture over the real picture so this isn't a fail-safe way to spot a skimmer. Most skimming devices are designed to be temporarily affixed to the ATM or gas pump so they can be easily retrieved by the bad guys once they've collected a batch of cardholder data.
If you think the scanning device doesn't look like it matches the machine's color and style, it might be a skimmer.

2. Look at other nearby gas pumps or ATMs card readers to see if they match the one you are using.
Unless skimmers are running a large operation, they probably are only skimming at one gas pump at a time at the station you are using. Look at the pump next to yours to see if the card reader and setup look different. If they do then you might have just spotted a skimmer.

3. Trust your instincts. If in doubt, use another machine somewhere else.
Our brains are excellent at recognizing things that seem out of place. If you get a sense that something looks off about the ATM you are about to use, you might be better off using one that you feel more comfortable with.

4. Avoid using your PIN number at the gas pump.
When you pay at the pump with your debit/credit card, you usually have the option to use it as a credit or a debit card. It's best to choose the credit option that allows you to avoid entering your PIN in sight of a Card Skimmer camera. Even if there is not a card skimmer camera in sight someone could be watching you enter your PIN and could subsequently mug you and take your card to the nearest ATM to withdraw some cash.

When you use it as a credit card you usually only have to enter your billing ZIP code as verification which is much safer than putting in your PIN.

If you absolutely need to use your secret PIN it’s also good practice to cover your fingers entering your secret PIN with your other hand to block the view from a hidden camera or from someone watching over you.

5. Keep an eye on your accounts
If you suspect that you might have had your card skimmed. Keep an eye on your account balance and report any suspicious activity immediately. Set up automatic alerts on your credit or debit card to notify you immediately with a text or email anytime a cash advance is made or any transaction is made.  The sooner you know a fraudulent transaction has happened, the sooner you can take action to stop the bad guys!

6. Keep your secret PIN secret!
Do not divulge your secret PIN to anyone whether verbally, online, text or in an email . No One is going to safeguard your PIN more than you will.

If you would like to contact me direct about your stay, please email me at jeff@hollywoodhotel.net and we hope to serve you again soon.

The hotel is situated between 2 subway lines $1.75 for a single trip. Ask for a tap card that you can load with money to make traveling easier. Although its not right in the center it is easy to move around. Bus stop on the corner street will get you to santa monica in an hour depending on traffic. Breakfast was nice and simple, great omlets. Rooms were tidy and housekeeping did a great job servicing my room daily.

The hotel is best known for the staff as they are the ones that made my trip so pleasant.  Front desk was easy to talk to and ask questions to. Everyone was always so helpful and offered great customer service.  They had my best interest in mind all of the time. A quick mention to Cynthia who was always so sweet and kind, thank you. :)

The room was spacious and clean.  The bathroom counter was extremely small but I made do.  I was on the 3rd floor.  Great view from the patio and very quiet. Fridge and  microwave in the room. The vending machines needed more attention and was never fully stocked. 

The breakfast was phenomenal. Hugo, Elvira, and Sonia make the best omlettes. Their infectious smile was worth going down to greet every morning.  All of the food was fresh, the breakfast counter was always clean, and they made me feel at home. I hope when I come again there's more of a variety, but overall good food. 

The location is close to the metro station which is very good.  The front desk assisted me with directions. They also have a taxi service available 24/7 - I took advantage of this a lot.  There's a few places to eat just down the street etc. I read on some of these reviews that the area can be sketchy, it's not.  I travelled alone from Canada and I did just fine. It's LA! 

I would definitely stay here again.  I hope the owner realizes how valuable his staff is.

Forevercruzeby,2,"Melaka, Malaysia",2015-03-31,FAMILY,2015-03-21,5,Satisfied and Content,"We were skeptical once arriving to the hotel but it was not so bad. The reviews are accurate the area is okay the hotel belongs somewhere else. We had a nice room facing inner court yard; aim for that if you can upon check in. 

Make time to check out the bar, pool, sauna, small gym, and courtyard seating area. Bar there as well but not open it seems. 

Breakfast is mediocre at best. (bland but options for toppings) 

Staff was professional at least. (Cynthia, Jermain and Anna) whom I encountered the most.  Knowledgeable and always smiling unlike the staff at the W hotel. 

Wish there was room service, 7 day a week bar, and bell service but maybe in the near future this can be a 4-5 star hotel. 

Happy with our stay and pay the parking people and do your research I always look ahead we overheard people checking in complaining about parking said free. Lazy travelers.",,5.0,5.0,,,,5.0,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-12-18,"Dear Guest,

Girlygirlrocks,1,,2015-02-28,FAMILY,2015-03-20,5,Worth the Switch!,"Started to stay at the W but the price was repulsive but we got some good rates online. We came to LA to simply party. We had a room on the first floor two queen beds. Extremely spacious, wall lining could be updated, bathroom a bit small, and I wish the area was better. It was 3 of us girls taking the subway from there to Hollywood but no problems at all area is safe even at 2am. Night audit guy entertained us both Friday and Saturday but not Sunday :(. (Jermaine) prompted all of us to review our stay good or bad.

Wednesday-Saturday nights catch great open-mic comedy in the bar. Every morning visit Hugo in the restaurant for a delicious omelette or waffle. Not your typical 'free' breakfast at all! Yum Yum. Hang out in the lovely courtyard to chat with other guests or visit the sparkling pool for a dip. You are about 2 miles or a $10 cab ride from the Hollywood tourist stops.

Very friendly, always asked how we are doing, made us great omelettes and scrambled eggs. He really did put on effort to make sure our day starts of well, and that we're having a good stay.

The room was clean and nice -you will want to ask for a room further away from the street if you are sensitive.

The location was really good! Just 100 m from metro, and you get easily anywhere by metro and/or bus. The location was safe and nearby you find many restaurants, so you just have to walk 10 steps and you have a restaurant in front of you.

There was a smoothie and juicebar super close aswell,and that was a big plus.

Overall we had a happy experience, and if you are travelling with a budget, We would say that this meets all the criteria! Its even a bit better :)

They have coffee, juice and bagels for breakfast in the morning. There is also a fridge in the room. That's about it as far as amenities. There is a convenience store within easy walking distance so you can stock up on refreshments. There is parking across the street for an additional $15.  

I stayed in the James Dean room on the first floor. It's an accessible room. Not sure what kind of handicap Dean had. The bed was extremely comfortable and there was a ceiling fan, which was a nice touch. My only complaint was the television. It was mounted in the corner of the room near the head of the bed.

Jack_de_ville,1,"Orange County, California",2015-03-31,BUSINESS,2015-03-03,1,Phenomenally disappointed.  you will be to.,"So after reading more good reviews rather than bad on yelp I decided to stay at the Hollywood Hotel for a three day conference in Brentwood. The Hotel itself is visually appealing and the ""Hollywood"" theme is done well. The only other aspect of this hotel that was pleasant was the breakfast and the Gentleman preparing it. He was very polite and eager to make you a good breakfast. 

Now on to the disappointing. Have had more than one bad experience of items ""disappearing"" from my room on various other trips at other hotel. So I now make it a point to not have any turndown service, Makes it easier for both parties. Which is why I left a ""no maid service"" on my door prior to leaving. So what do I find when I come back at the end of the day? Yup, they came in anyways. Called the front desk and all that was told to me was "" will look into it,""  

Second, the room was hot when I checked in and as I came to find out, the a/c was not working. I'm trying to keep this short and concise. So, again I called the front desk to voice my concern to which they said they'd send someone to my room. 5 min. Later a main't man shows up with a ladder while I'm trying to eat dinner and he replies "" yup, not working."" He offered me a fan to which I declined stating that all the fan would do would blow around the hot air. Asked him to have the mgr. call me and a few min. Later I get a call from the front desk. From which I received a "" I'm sorry to hear your upset..a/c isn't working throughout the hotel. It's been like that for years. We can offer you a fan or you can try opening your window for twenty min. Or so. ""It's the "" you can open your window"" that I found humorous. 

Now, let me mention something, I served over seven years out of Camp Pendleton and have seem some ungodly things in my time. So I'd much rather have been in a uncomfortable room with running water a bathroom and wifi. So in the grand scheme of things is it that big of a deal...nope, not at all. However, I paid for a service, to stay in their hotel with all that comes along with that. 

Now, if I were to say, hey I know you're charging me X dollars a night, but I'm only going to pay Y amount because that's what I always do. In your wildest dreams do you think they'd say ""well, if that's all ya got, so ok I guess."" Nope, they'd say thanks for thinking of us and don't let the door hit ya on the way out. 

Ok, that's it. Just the apathy that is displayed is disappointing. Granted, the staff gets paid minimum wage and have no real incentive or power to change anything but some sense of integrity would be nice to see. So, you're better off staying a a Holiday Inn or any other of those type, just don't stay here unless you're fine with settling or don't care for standards.",,,1.0,1.0,,1.0,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-10-10,"Dear Guest...

2Coldtobemad,1,"Courseulles-sur-Mer, France",2015-02-28,COUPLES,2015-02-27,5,Awesome ....,"This is a lovely quaint old Hollywood style hotel central to everywhere with the Metro Red Line just a block away.  In one direction, the metro takes you to the heart of Hollywood and beyond in just a few short stops.  In the other direction, it takes you straight to Union Station in downtown LA.  The rooms, although showing a little wear in some, are large comfortable and clean.  Some face out to a lovely little courtyard although if you prefer quiet, maybe book one on an upper floor away from the lobby.  The breakfasts are amazing as well as entertaining.  You can watch Chef Hugo do magic with any kind of omelet or waffle you want and always with a big smile thrown in.  Sonia is delightful and so helpful, friendly and sweet.  At first I thought the hotel was in a bit of a sketchy neighborhood but there are a lot of amenities close by and a really nice restaurant area about 4 blocks up (along with 2 hospitals).  Wherever you go in LA you will find your share of homeless people and this area is no different but they are just that....homeless people.  There go I but for the grace of God and my heart aches for them rather than fears them.  There is a great outdoor swimming pool area that is well maintained and gives you the feeling you are staying in a resort not just a hotel.  There is also a comedy club downstairs free to attend.  We went but I think we may have been the only spectators and the rest of the people were the comedians because we saw at least 10 in the 45 mind we were there.  Good show though and great place for an upcoming comedian to get their start.  Some pretty famous comics got there start there.  We have had a very delightful stay here and are so very happy to have discovered this little gem.  It will definitely be our home again if we return to LA.  Not sure I should be telling other people about this place or we should just keep it to ourselves.  It was very affordable and hoping it stays that way so we can afford to come back again!",,,,,,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2018-11-03,"Dear Guest...

Good clean room a bit tight on space but livable. The bed was firm and comfortable. Our room was on the front of the hotel and with a hospital just up the block there was a fair bit of siren noise.  Breakfast was included which is a big bonus but the food  was nothing special. 
The bar was, not to mince words, was seedy with non stop, so called, comedy which was really just boring chat with extra profanity there was no draft beer and a bottle was $7. We spent all of 5 minutes there before going to the liquor store to fill up the fridge.  If they had utilised the courtyard as a bar area I would probably not have baulked at the price.

My shuttle was 15 minutes late and literally took me an hour out of the way to pick up another passenger.  It's 19 dollars. Get an Uberx.

TLL441,33,"Ontario, California",2015-02-28,COUPLES,2015-02-15,3,It's at least a 3 stars hotel,"Stayed here for one night for my Valentines.  We had finished watching Wicked at the Pantages and didn't wanna drive too far home late at night.  Thus, we used this Groupon deal to stay one night.  

Parking - If you wanna park in the hotel's parking lot, you have to pay $20/day.  We end up parking on the street for free.  Ridiculous, how that hotel will charge for parking.  

Service - Checking-in was simple and the receptionist was nice and courteous.  Though, when it was check-out time, we were running a little behind cause we slept in.  We received a call around 11:15am reminding us check-out time is at 11:00am.  Would have been nice if they offered us a later check-out time or something instead of nicely saying ""get outta here.""  

Grounds - The hotel is not in the nicest area and there's really nothing around the hotel to walk to eat or anything.  

Room - We had a handicapped accessible room (huge shower w/ no tub).  The room was fairly a huge size with tile flooring.  Decorum was up to date and mostly clean.  Though would have been nice if they put in a little desk, dinning table, or just a sitting area with such huge space available.  

Noise - It was very very loud in the morning, you can literally hear everyone's conversation in the hallway right outside of our room.  That was probably the most annoying thing about this hotel, they definitely need to invest in better sound barriers.  

Unfortunately, we did not wake up on time for the complimentary breakfast and did not have enough time to check out the pool.  Though we did stopped by the fitness center for a brief moment.  Fitness was not the best but not the best either.  Overall, this is not a bad hotel and I would give it 3 stars.",Avoid the 1st floor near the &quot;gift shop&quot; if you prefer quiet.,,4.0,,1.0,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2018-11-03,"Dear Guest,

13JoeS,10,,2015-01-31,COUPLES,2015-02-15,5,A Truly Great Hollywood Experience,"We stayed there in January 2015 and it was the best place ever we could have stayed. It was a true, classic Hollywood experience. It is located very close to the Los Feliz area and there are scores of restaurants and bars in walking distance- not to mention Sunset Blvd and Griffith Park nearby!. The hotel staff was truly professional and warm at the same time. Jermaine at the front desk was helpful on a daily basis with concise answers to our many questions and great suggestions. The breakfast buffet was the best ever and the breakfast staff was equally personable. Their courtyard is nicer than most New Orleans courtyards, and with the weather in L.A. in the mid 70s in January it was great to have the outdoor space there as well as by the pool. I notice a couple of people complained about the $28 daily parking fee. Please know that pretty much all hotels in L.A. charge a parking fee and that $28 daily is on the lower end of what I have seen there. I would definitely 100% recommend this hotel- and don't forget to have a drink in their W.C. Fields Bar where the prices for mixed drinks are the lowest I've seen in Hollywood- and if you're lucky, there may be a Comedy Slam going on",We enjoyed having a room that opened on to their amazing tropical courtyard.,,5.0,5.0,,5.0,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2018-11-03,"Dear Guest...

Jessica,6,"London, United Kingdom",2014-06-30,COUPLES,2015-02-13,5,Excellent base to explore Hollywood. Great stay!,"My girlfriend and I chose the hotel for our base from which to explore Hollywood in summer last year, and stayed for 9 nights.

- The room was nice, reasonably sized, clean and quiet. Our's overlooked the courtyard which is a pleasant little space. Ice machine in the corridor was handy. Coffee filter machine in the room was good. The pool was also nice though we didn't spend too much time there. 

- The breakfast was a highlight - they make the waffles and omelettes (to your specification) in front of you and they are very tasty. The rest of the self serve breakfast spread is good too. The staff at breakfast were always courteous and friendly. The breakfast area is large and clean.

- The location is what really drew us to the hotel. The area is rough around the edges but the hotel is a minutes walk from the subway station that we used to explore Hollywood. If you've never taken the subway, don't be put off - taxis can be so expensive & unnecessary. We were warned against using it by a student we met on the plane but as we live in London and use the public transport network all the time, we planned on using the metro system and I'm glad we did: It's really quiet because everybody drives - the trains aren't particularly frequent but they are relatively fast. It's also super cheap! Something like £15 for a week's travel with a TAP (oyster) card! Obviously, unlike London, there aren't that many stations but you can get to Universal, Downtown (MOCA etc), Hollywood Walk of Fame (and the museums & attractions found there) with ease. We went to a Dodgers game via the metro - getting off at Union Station and then getting the free Dodgers express shuttle to the stadium. I REALLY recommend this way of getting to the game, if you go, because the traffic (which we bypassed in the bus lane) was insane!
There are two metro stations near by, we mainly used the super close one - left out of the hotel and cross right at the junction (literally a stone's throw away). We did also use the bus, to get to there other end of Sunset (it's longer than you think), and found it to be a really easy, normal - not scary - experience, there's multiple stops near the hotel (You can use your TAP card on the metro bus too).

Other things nearby:
- CVS grocery store/pharmacy. The woman at the counter gave us a discount when we said we were staying at the hotel when she mentioned a store card.
- Wacko Soap Plant shop. A quirky shop full of weird stuff - worth a visit only a 10-15 minute walk.
- Head towards Skylight Books on N. Vermont Ave. There's some trendy boutiques and nice looking restaurants etc on that stretch.

Other recommendations:
- Buy a ""Go Card"" & visit: Universal, Hollywood Museum (my favourite of all the museums) & Mel's Diner, Warner Bros. Tour (brilliant), Dolby Theatre, Grammy Museum, etc etc.
- Eat at a Saddle Ranch restaurant (even if you're veggie it's good, I promise).
- Go to MOCA.
- Go to a Dodgers game.
- Visit Amoeba Music.

All in all, we had an excellent stay at the Hollywood Hotel. The staff were friendly and the hotel was clean and very nice. I would recommend you stay here, especially if you've got a busy itinerary planned like we did as it is a fantastic base for exploration.",,,,,,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2018-11-06,"Dear Guest

Olivia L,10,"Gulfport, Mississippi",2015-02-28,COUPLES,2015-02-11,5,AMAZING,"SO my stay here was amazing. The room was nice. I only wish the bed was softer and there was lighting in the little hallway into the room. It was very dark. Be bathroom was amazing. I loved the tub. The overall style of the room was very nice and clean. The young lady at the front desk, Anna I believe her name was, was very helpful. The parking is nice. I enjoyed the complimentary breakfast. I can honestly say it was the best comp. breakfast I have ever had. Well worth the money. We booked this hotel through priceline.com and got a pretty amazing deal. The courtyard ambiance was so relaxing. Our room was right there by the front entrance, which I was hesitant about because of noise levels and what not but honestly it was not bad. I loved how the metro and the bus station was a small walk away. Made traveling to Hollywood, Universal and Union Station so easy. We didn't have to use the car, which if anyone doesn't know this traffic in LA is serious. Its really in a great location, with helpful, always smiling staff, an amazing comp breakfast, the room was awesome, and a beautiful courtyard. I would say we got what we paid for but we got much more than that. It was worth every penny to me. We stayed here for $104 a night for 4 nights. Other hotels for that price left a lot to be desired. AGAIN amazing staff and BREAKFAST, only complaint was the bed was too hard for my taste..... and they need like ONE light in the hallway into the room.","we stayed in the room directly across from the service counter, and the first door from the entrance. We heard people checking in and out (it was quiet after 11pm and got noisy around 8 am but we were up anyways) It was actually convenient to run in if we forgot something and needed to be quick. I wasn&#39;t bothered by it.",,5.0,,5.0,,5.0,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2018-11-08,"Dear Guest...

For the price paid, it was good value.  All of the hotel staff I encountered were friendly and welcoming.  Breakfast was great for this price point.  One downside was the hotel is not within walking distance of attractions but because the metro was so close, getting around was easy.  We faced the courtyard on the third floor and it was very quiet.  The thing that prevented me from goving it 5 stars was the cleanliness and condition of the bathroom.

The pictures are misleading.  Remodeling going on, not all rooms created equal. 
Gaps in tile/tub area allowing infestation ants, forcing me to live out of suitcase all week (they were in my drawers). Suggested solution was to spray insecticide.
Beds were rock hard, and way too high off the floor--falling out of bed would be painful.
No carpet or rugs, which makes for cleaner than carpet, but uncomfortable on bare feet.
In older rooms, lots of outlets on lamp bases making recharging phones and laptops easy.
Ticket box for parking area too recessed and close to gate to make it very difficult to use--a driver in front of us actually fell out of her car getting a ticket.
Hall carpeting worn and stained.
Elevator excruciatingly slow--stairs far faster way to traverse floors.
Rooms do NOT adjoin (as stated in website description), they are merely adjacent, IF you request that.
Lighting in bathroom poor and mirror on door mounted such that grooming was difficult
AC vs. Heat--either way, fan really loud, and bare floors it always felt cold.
Balconies adjoin, are chipped paint, no 'when open' safety lock, and no windows so fresh air when sleeping impossible.

Triffel,49,,2014-12-31,FAMILY,2015-01-09,3,Add parking charges to the price per night,"Good location,  about 10 mins drive from the walk of shame,  etc.   Clean enough,  but bit grubby in the corners (though this is my experience of many hotels at this level). 

I paid for an extra bed,  and was questioned at reception as to whether i still wanted it,  which i found a bit odd. 

On checking in,  i was advised that parking was not free.  But was in fact 24 dollars a day.  When i stated that I was not aware of it and hadn't seen it mentioned on the website,  the receptionist said ""it's all over the website"", which i found very unhelpful and unnecessary.  I've just checked,  and it's definitely not mentioned on the mobile site.  I booked thru an agent (Agoda), and it was not mentioned in the confirmation either. 

This of course bumps up the cost per night. However, if you are planning to be out for most of the day, like we were,  there are parking meters on the streets either side of the hotel,  which are a dollar per hour, maximum 2 hour stay,  and free between 8pm and 8am. I used the car park for just one night,  and parked on the street for the remainder of our stay. 

We didn't suffer any noise pollution (3rd floor). The breakfast was decent.  I only had cereal, but the others seemed to enjoy the waffles. Bit sparse on the tea and coffee facilities though.

AC in rooms,  and a mobile radiator which we used one night and it was enough to heat the room nicely.  Check-in not until 3pm, but they have luggage storage facility.

L Kay M,6,Indiana,2014-12-31,FAMILY,2015-01-09,5,Extraordinary Staff / Good Hotel / Great Service,"I have stayed here 4 times since my son moved to LA in the summer of 2011.  It has become my home away from home, with my most recent visit, Christmas 2014.  I love Hollywood Hotel!  My husband, Tom, has come to LA with me the last two times and he loves the wonderful breakfast omelettes and waffles made to order for him and served every morning.  The entire breakfast crew, especially Hugo & Sonia, are the best cooks and servers, working hard to make the hotel guests their number one priority.  Great job!

Michael has the in-hotel store where you can purchase t-shirts for family and he will make sure you have what you need, whatever size and color.  He may have an odd item even if it is not on display!

Jermaine is priceless at the front desk.  Others that I know that offer great service include Anna and  Cecile, who I met and had the opportunity to know on this last trip.
 
Our room is always clean, sheets are changed, and the cleaning staff do a wonderful job.  It is an older hotel so bathrooms show the signs of aging.  This is not the area of LA where you want to walk out by yourself at night.  I have never had any problems but I don't take any risks either.  There is a really good Mexican Chicken Eatery on the corner of Santa Monica Blvd and Vermont.  You can order a half chicken to go and it comes with black beans, salsa, rise, and tortillas.  It is such a good meal that serves two people for just under ten dollars!  It was a great trip and I (my husband, too)  will choose this hotel again in the future as my first choice when I  stay in LA.  We can afford a more popular location, but why?  We get more than we expect, greater value in the dollar spent, and we walk away happier for having chosen HH.

Aussiedelighthaier,1,"Sydney, Australia",2014-12-31,FAMILY,2015-01-08,5,Well rounded stay,"For the price we paid I'm impressed. Even extended our stay a few more nights. Even when I called ahead and spoke with Jermaine he gave me and my wife a heads up on the area, attractions, food, and hotel rooms he even checked us in (class act) cheers to all the staff they were all helpful. We had a room facing the courtyard (highly re commended per availability upon check in). Room comes with frig and microwave which was nice since our room in Vegas charged extra. Parking is 24.20 but worth it; private parking lot plus if you think about it breakfast is free as well as the use of the amenities including wifi so other reviews I've read I say suck it up its worth it. Breakfast in the basement level was good for the family including the bar as well. Well rounded hotel and you can notice the underway remodeling its gonna be nice in there. Our next time to the states will be at this hotel. Great Vacay!

However, there are many people approach other people around metro station, which made me feel insecure, and won't recommend person who consider to stay at this hotel alone, you will feel insecure when you walk back home by yourself in the dark night. Hotel staff seems not knowing the stuff well, and not welling to help guest. Overall, it's just a hotel for people to stay, highly recommend people who stay in this hotel have to be at least group of two people. ",,,,,,,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-10-30,"Dear Guest,

1) once you start searching for a plug to charge your electronics that you have used up throughout the day, the wiring to the outlets is rather sketchy with bent or broke outlets that are a potential fire hazards...yay just where I want to lay my head at night (sarcasm)

2) once you get past the fire hazard you lay down on their beds that costantly squeak and hear metal beneath you...hmph

3) if you can get past the dusty faux hardwood floor, the decor in your room is showing age with disappointment

4) bathroom is rather small with little renovation styling (pics shown are somewhat deceiving)

5) and the best one yet...our room door does not shut completely unless you rudely slam it which shows such a safe place to stay (sarcasm) and the card reader is held together with scotch tape yay!

Walking distance to Metro and convenient drive to beaches, downtown,  Griffith Observatory, Beverly Hills, Burbank, etc. Microwave and fridg a plus. Balcony view nice from 3rd floor. Staff very helpful. Nancy, at the front desk, went above and beyond from reservation time and questions before arrival, through the entire stay (Felt like I knew her when we arrived!). The made-to-order hot breakfasts were excellent with generous hours and Hugo (absolutely terrific) and Sonia providing quality, friendly service. Anabol (?spelling) evening serviceperson was also extremely personable and helpful, but herein lies the problem in needing him to come up two nights. I would rate housekeeping extremely poor. Sticky stuff on nightstand, sheets had to be changed twice after finding specks of ""dirt"" and even hairs on the sheets when turning them down! (took photos...) and our last day there we also discovered the bathroom had not been cleaned well either, long hair on floor and gunk and more hair in shower drain cover. Very disappointing and rather disgusting, but too tired to move everything on our last night. Encouraged to report this here, and just haven't gotten to it since returning. 11/29 - 12/4. It is older and some cosmetic work could be done, but otherwise satisfactory. We were there during a cool spell though and since A/C was still on and central heating not, the room was cold and required an electric space heater. The parking fee is a bit high, but convenient and felt safe.For the mentioned problem areas, only give an average rating.

But as for the hotel, it's kind of old and used, and apart from geography, its only connection with the movie industry are a few pictures from movies on the walls.  The rooms are small, but at least they have charming views of the mucky brick walls of neighbouring buildings.  It's a bit grungy.

We also used a bus (which you can ride using the same prepaid card for the subway) to go to Beverly hills. It's also close to the Griffith observatory. It was a nice one-hour walk for us to get there.

The most important reason for us to choose this hotel was complementary hot breakfast! We liked it very much! The cook who served us was Hugo, who was very friendly and efficient. He even spoke a bit of Japanese (by the way we are a Japanese couple), as he learned from many Japanese visitors.

As a first time visitor to LA from England, we were very confused on where to stay, especially as Los Angeles attractions are not in one place!
After much searching and a lot of umming and arring due to mixed reviews and location, we finally settled on the Hollywood Hotel . 
Good Things
+Rooms very spacious and spotlessly clean.
+Location is very good and close to Universal studios and a short walk to the subway (for walk of fame etc)
+Free breakfast which is OK.
+Modern rooms (we stayed in the junior suite overlooking the court yard.)

Bad Things.
+Some say the area is a bit sketchy but I felt perfectly safe and secure.
+Parking was charged at $20 a night which I thought was a rip off, (Budget this into your final price as you may find other hotels workout cheaper and offer free parking)
+Bathroom and some areas of the hotel were worn and needs updating.

Overall we were happy with our stay and would highly recommend this hotel for anyone visiting LA on a budget.
If it wasn't for the extortionate parking charges and the slightly outdated bathroom this hotel would have been worthy of a 5*

This hotel seems to be renovating in phases (but in 5 nights there, we never heard anything), so it does not all look consistent, but the service is very consistent- always friendly and accommodating. We booked the Junior Suite on the third floor looking into the cutest tropical courtyard with water fountains and white lights at night. From our room we could look out at the Hollywood Hills. The furniture and the bathroom are very dated, and there are no plates or utensils in the kitchenette, but the room is clean and the bed was extremely comfortable. Sheets crisp and white with plenty of fluffy pillows.There is an outdoor pool, sauna, courtyard and bar, and the best complimentary breakfast with made to order omelets and waffles. 
If you are looking for luxury, this is not the place for you.  If you are looking for service with a smile and clean comfortable rooms at a good price- check out the Hollywood Hotel.","Third floor has more late afternoon sunshine and good views of the Hollywood Hills or town.
Try to book Courtyard side, as the street side can be noisy (sirens/ traffic etc)",,5.0,5.0,,3.0,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-12-18,"Dear Guest,

It was close to the train station and took 5 mins to get into the city and all the tourist attractions. Breakfast was ok but it is a shame that no other meals or snacks are served during the day or evening, we resorted to eating a proper meal at lunchtime and getting a sandwich from the local Subway and eating in our room at night. The pool is a good size and nice and private. Staff were very helpful and friendly. The room was adequate but needs modernising and updating, didn't like the fact that there was only a clothes rail and no proper wardrobe.

There were hairs on pillows, towels and on the floor.  Front desk people were rude and didn't seem to care about my concerns.  And to top it off their chef is rude and racist and he discriminates.  Elevators are extremely slow and the halls are dirty, carpet looks filthy and the room had a terrible smell.  Their location is ghetto and their 22dlls a day parking lot spaces are designed for compact cars only... overall this hotel has been the ugliest hotel I've ever been into.  Pictures on Website are just a bunch of lies.  Plus they ended up with extra fees during check out after I was given a price over the phone a few day before my stay.

The hotel was not in the 'heart' of Hollywood but it was a quick and easy train ride away, too easy. Plenty of eateries nearby. The complimentary breakfast was mostly continental but there was the option of scrambled eggs or an omelette cooked to order and I will really recommend the omelette. The room was clean and tidy, and well serviced daily. There was quite a bit of noise from the corridors in the morning, especially noisy children which was a little irritating. Information from the staff was well intended but not necessarily right, hence we got lost trying to find a shopping complex and ended up paying a bit for a cab.

barcodeVegas,272,"Las Vegas, Nevada",2014-11-30,COUPLES,2014-11-15,4,Two times good,"We originally found this place earlier in the year quite by accident. It is one of the best, affordable places to stay in the Hollywood area. This time was no different from the first and all as well on this one night stay. The rooms are large and comfortable. The breakfast was great with omelets and waffles made live for you. There is ample parking (costs extra) in a secure lot too. One caveat, which will work itself out, was the elevator being impossibly slow in the morning check out commute. This was oddly paired with the lack of telephone or television check out. We took the stairs down (third floor). We purchased the room from Expedia (never again from them) more on that some other time. Because of this, we ended up paying a little more than we did the first time we stayed here. This is the hotel we will always try to book for our forays into the LA/Hollywood area. The prices fluctuated on this hotel for a few days before we went so go direct to the hotel page or Orbitz, Travelocity, etc. and get the cancellation insurance whenever possible.",Perhaps try to get a room on the lower levels.

The2KsAuckland,58,,2014-11-30,FRIENDS,2014-11-14,3,Great location for transport but not for property and bodily safety.,"Lovely staff.  Tired accommodation.  Can't agree with other comments about the breakfast as I found it to be low quality mostly stodge.  That said, there was plenty of it and the price was right so no complaints.  The omelette cooker was relentless and implacable but I'm not convinced there were real eggs in his omelettes.
What.....  NO KETTLE!?!  Only other place I've experienced that was Amsterdam.  Madness.  There was some weird looking coffee maker but it looked a bit grubby so we didn't chance it.  Major for me as I like to make a cup of tea in my room.
Some eating places in walking distance but low quality.
No safe in room and it felt necessary.
Balcony but no chair to sit on it.  Comfortable bed.
With a few titivations this could be a great place but maybe their business model keeps the prices low.
Overall value for what we paid and would stay again mainly for the location.
Word of warning, DO NOT book the Golden Coast shuttle.  Don't know if this is what the hotel uses exclusively as my companion booked it.  They were an hour late and blamed us for a last minute booking though we booked the day before and confirmed in the morning.  We then suffered a hair raising high speed (where possible in LA rush hour) journey not directly to the airport, stopping to collect some other hapless travellers from the ""Banana"" (I didn't see that place as an option, interesting) who the despatcher was told to buy time with as we were late for them too.  Recommend go with Super Shuttles, laughingly referred to by the driver as ""Stupid Shuttles"".  Not so stupid, they turn up and get you there without threat to life and limb.",One with 2 beds.

The staff are so welcoming and helpful, my room was great and I almost felt as though I was at a home away from home. My favorite part of my stay was the complimentary breakfast the hotel offers for guests. They had such a great variety of food options and the staff at the restaurant, particularly Hugo, Juan and Sonia, were absolutely amazing. They are so so friendly and really do brighten up your morning. 

The hotel itself was aesthetically charming although had it been located elsewhere it would probably harbor better views. The best view I could find from the hotel was on the third floor balcony but there were constructions in process so I wasn't able to see for sure how good the view was. 

The Hollywood Hotel offers many things complimentary with your stay such as designer bathroom amenities and excellent high speed internet & wifi however, it would have been so much better if my parking permit was complimentary also. Considering my 3 week stay, I didn't really appreciate having to pay $22 something a day for parking.

All in all, my stay at The Hollywood Hotel was amazing and I would definitely recommend them to my family and friends.","It would be nice to have a set or two of plastic cutlery, plates and cups in the rooms. It also would have been good if there was an option to get harder pillows, mine literally offered no support to my neck, even when I had 4 stacked up on each other, I would have really liked a harder pillow.

It is close to the train and amenities such as a pharmacy and a bevy of restaurant. What makes it an even better hotel is its staff, particularly Cecile Eugenio and Nancy. For example, I stayed at the hotel between November 6-8 and in that time Nancy kindly granted me the room I requested, and, more importantly, Cecile went out of her way to send me my glasses which I had left at the hotel. She called me when they had found the glasses, and promptly sent it to me personally. This kind of attentiveness, I think, really makes this hotel stand out.

We found the hotel to be great - our first experience was the reception staff, who were consistently brilliant throughout our stay.  They were courteous, friendly and approachable - nothing at all was too much trouble.  As first time LA visitors, they really helped us orientate to the city and shared some top tips! 

The room was clean, comfortable and spacious.  It seemed a little 'cold' when we walked in due to the laminate flooring, however we have absolutely no complaints... and who goes to LA to sit in their room anyway?!  We had a room that overlooked the courtyard - we didn't ever manage to visit it, but it looked lovely on an evening.

Breakfast was included, which consisted of a great variety of foods including the usual cereal, toast and pastries, fruit and made-to-order omelettes and waffles.  The quality was great, and again, the staff were very friendly. 

Initially, the neighbourhood seemed 'questionable' and we were worried we were outside of the city, however we never felt vulnerable at all, and central Hollywood was less that 10 minutes on the metro (the nearest station about a 2-3 minute walk from the hotel). 

The hotel was undergoing extensive renovations, which, after reading other reviews seems to be an ongoing project.  The 'new look' was fresh, modern and clean, so you could forgive the slight inconvenience of relaying the corridor flooring!

The front desk staff was welcoming. Room 215 was a good size considering how old the building is. There was definitely a strong cleaning solution smell but I appreciated it. It reassured me that our room was CLEAN. There were a good amount of towels. The bed was comfy, but it was a queen size.We had a view of the interior patio and could open the sliding glass door to the balcony. The water pressure was pretty darn good. When you flush the toilet it makes a funny wooshing sound for about a minute. Great to have a fridge and microwave. The AC was OK but the heater did not work in rm 215. That's ok...they provided some nice fluffy bedding. No closet but their is a decent attempt at a rack to hang your clothes and an ironing board is provided. Coffee and tea in the room. Free Wi-Fi. The floors are made of marble, so if you have cold feet bring slippers or thick socks. Check out is at 11AM. Laundry room and a general store available on the 1st floor.
There is a pool that is just past the parking lot. I think it is open from 8AM to 8PM.
They do sell out. So don't wait to long to book your room. They are also in the midst of renovating. 
Gated parking was $24 a day.
Breakfast was free until 1030AM...so that balanced out. The breakfast was good too. Eggs to order. Yes there can be a line. Fresh fruit, tasty breads, good selection of cereals. Hotel breakfast meet, hashbrowns and mini-waffles. The staff was awesome and continuously cleaned up the dining area. 
Ye,s the neighborhood looks sketchy...but that is not unusual. It's Hollywood! There are normal neighborhoods in older buildings, VERY busy streets, shopping centers on every corner and then pall of a sudden posh homes with fancy golf courses. It was a fine location to walk around in during the day time. Not to far from where all the fancy stuff is, maybe within 5 to 8 miles of LACMA, Farmer's Market and CBS studios.

ILOVEVARADERO123,14,,2014-10-31,SOLO,2014-11-06,4,Clean and comfortable!,"I stayed for 10 days and felt very comfortable here, especially travelling solo! Hotel is clean, room spacious with 2 queen beds and a balcony, facing the courtyard. I slept very well here, felt safe. I didn't rent a car but the metro is 2 min walk from the hotel and I used it to get everywhere! Only a couple of stops away from Hollywood Blvd and a short walk to Sunset Blvd where you can catch buses. I had no problems sightseeing and getting around LA without a car. You can catch tour buses to get you to lots of places from Hollywood Blvd! I went to Santa Monica, Venice beach, Malibu, very easy to get to Union station to take the Amtrak which I did too! There are some very cool museums in LA to check out. I also bused to Getty center and Griffith observatory. Easy to get around but traffic in LA will slow you down as it would with a car anyways. Hotel staff were great and they have an awesome breakfast in the dining room. They make an omelette anyway you want and yummy waffles. Hugo the chef was really great! He remembers your name and your order. Only issues both my key cards stopped working and I had to get them reset. My hair dryer stopped working too but they fixed it. They try very hard to make sure your happy and comfortable. They have a safe at the front desk too. Staff was great at giving directions, which bus to take, easiest way to get to attractions etc.The neighborhood itself is okay but after dark can seem a bit sketchy. No one bothered me and I could have taken a cheap cab ride more often but didn't bother. I looked at lots of other hotels before choosing this one. Everything seemed either too expensive or too cheap.This one met all my needs and I would definitely stay here again! There is also a Rite aid, shoe store, Wendy's and other places to eat within walking distance which was very handy!","Ask for a room on the 3rd floor with a balcony, facing the courtyard.",5.0,4.0,,,,4.0,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-30,"Dear Guest,

Aussieck,10,"Sydney, Australia",2013-12-31,COUPLES,2014-11-03,3,"Clean and comfortable, local 3 stars","The Hollywood Hotel is a cheap, reasonably great locationed hotel. It's in the West Hollywood area near Vermont/Santa Monica & Vermont / Sunset metro stations. It's relatively easy to get around on the metro once you get the hang of it. Its' located in between Santa Monica Blvd and Sunset Blvd.

We managed to get a deal online which included breakfast, hey its wasn't anything 5 stars but it certainly did the job.

Being my first time in LA it was a little nerving to get around at night in the area, and would feel safer if there was more than 1 person or larger group. Large amount of homeless and mentally ill residents in the area, but this is a whole for LA not just the area of the hotel.

Some nice little bars to visit on Sunset Blvd in town, and diners weren't too bad either. I must we purchased one meal and shared as theme sizes are quite large and would definitely do 2.

Thisby,21,"Phoenix, Arizona",2014-11-30,COUPLES,2014-11-03,4,Good experience in East Hollywood,"We stayed for two nights at the Hollywood Hotel -- The Hotel of Hollywood, as they style themselves. This is a hotel with an historic past, now updated for modern tastes. The rooms are a little smallish (it is an older hotel, after all) but they are nicely updated and quite comfortable with refrigerator, microwave, and free WiFi. The bed and linens were comfy and better than I would have expected from a hotel in this price range. The hot breakfast (included in the price) was very good. The staff was excellent, very friendly and helpful. There were no issues with checking in or checking out. The only complaint I have was that the parking charge was pretty high and was not mentioned on the website where I booked our stay. Still, it was a gated lot so it was probably worth it in L.A. The price was right and we would probably stay here again if we had reason to visit this area.","Hotel has a central courtyard, so there are courtyard rooms and external (street-facing) rooms.

Cheetahjab,3,,2014-10-31,BUSINESS,2014-11-02,2,"Stay at Motel 6, at least they'll leave the light on for you.","So we get there and they immediately start to run us around about fee's and where they'll be placing us. We get up into the room and it's like 50 degrees. We turn the thermostat up to about 75, and it manages to get colder.. Call the desk , their response ""Oh you just have to turn it off"" So the central AC was either ON or off. The thermostat was for show. So they where doing some work on the floor we where staying on. But they worked until 10:30 at night with sanders and hammers, and started back up again around 7am. The room next to us had a bathroom fan so loud it shook our wall , and of course those people lived in the bathroom.. Parking was outrageous at $25 a day on top of the stay. SO lots of Negative things about this hotel.

One good thing. For as basic as their overall breakfast was, the hot bar, which had a few chefs there make any sort of egg you wanted, be it fried, scrambled or an over stuffed omelet. As well as different choices of Waffles each day on top of the plain they offered, Blue Berry,Strawberry, Chocolate, and I think maple Cinnamon while we where there, as well as a full juice bar. For 5 out of our 8 days there Chef Hugo was there and was quite frankly amazing with what little he had to work with. The hotel itself, with it's TILE FLOORED ROOMS, and a LIFTED BATHTUB WITH LOWERED CEILING so anyone over the height of 5'2 had issues showing was HORRIBLE. If you're in LA, you'd be quite better off at a motel 6 over this place. At least they have free parking.

Check in and staff: Sucked check in was so late, we waited for hours. Thankfully we got in a bit earlier. Staff were brilliant especially the cleaners who greeted you often. 
Room: I was not aware there was renovations happening, and the construction guys had to help us with luggage to get around it, but they were helpful and informative and got it all completed fast so the next day we could get in and out of our room with no hassle. The room was fresh and clean looking. 
Bed and pillows: I found both very hard - but I'm use to soft. My back found it a shock. 
Services: wifi mostly great, you choose the closest to you for the best reception, except at around 7 it worked fast. Breakfast included and was very yummy. 1 omelette with heaps of toppings. 4 Waffles - different flavours. Toast, fruit, meat, yoghurt, bread, bagels what more could you want?

VenusInFurs,49,"Toronto, Canada",2014-02-28,COUPLES,2014-10-26,2,An uncomfortable stay,"We picked the hotel partly due to its location.  The hotel is located within walking distance to Vermont/Sunset metro stations, which was very convenient since we didn't want to have drive every day. The parking fee, at $25 dollars a day for self-parking, while high, seemed reasonable compared to other LA hotels. 

As soon as we arrived at the hotel, we noticed they were undergoing renovations. The front desk assured us it wouldn't be a problem. However, when we got to our room, we noticed that it was practically in the middle of the renovations. The room itself was bigger than we expected, but the amenities were quite lacking. The A/C was very loud and some appliances in the room didn't work.

We also had a lot of trouble sleeping. The fact that the walls to the rooms are paper thin didn't help.  We got woken up several times by the sound of drilling as well as the sound of people talking and rolling their luggage in the corridors. To make matters worse, there was an odd smell coming from the bathroom sink, possibly from the renovations. The next day, we found a huge cockroach in the shower. After complaining, we were moved to another room. The next room was quieter, but not by much.

The only plus of our stay - the free breakfast buffet. The cook, Hugo, was great!

To be honest, we didn't expect the hotel and the neighborhood to be so uninviting. There's really not much to do in the area, so we ended up driving more than we had hoped to. As we were checking out, there was an angry man yelling at the front desk, accusing the hotel of stealing his money -- the perfect finale to a very uncomfortable stay at the Hollywood Hotel.",,,3.0,2.0,3.0,,,,,,,11

Positives: large comfortable bed, clean sheets everyday, very clean bathroom with clean towels every day, lovely decor in room and surrounding hotel, free wifi, free breakfast every morning, and nice pool.

Negatives: the only negative is that it is not made very clear when booking the cost of parking. Although having experience in 4 other cities, the parking at this hotel was actually VERY reasonable. 

Not sure what the immediate surrounding area is like on foot as we would drive to most places, LA is massive and walking anywhere is impossible!

It did not disappoint. The reception staff were very friendly and helpful and a big shout out to Cecile who paid us extra attention. Our room was one of the nearly refurbished and was extremely comfortable and suited our needs. The balcony to our room was shared, but not a problem in the slightest. Our room overlooked the interior courtyard which was beautifully lit at night, but could be slightly noisy when there were guests out there late. 

The hotel is very close to the metro station, Santa Monica and Vermont, which is three stops, 10 minutes, to central Hollywood. The immediate area near the hotel is not particularly tourist friendly, for example it is situated in a mainly Latino area with not many restaurants surrounding it other than fast food joints.  However, the Lotus lounge opposite the hotel is worth a visit and it you are prepared for a 15 minute walk there is an array of indian and thai restaurants worth a visit next to the 1739 Sports bar, which we recommend on a Monday night for a buzzing atmosphere.

K_P_100314,8,"Aurora, Illinois",2014-10-31,FAMILY,2014-10-12,5,Very nice hotel overall,"Overall, we had a very pleasant stay at the Hollywood Hotel. I had read contradicting reviews so I was a little nervous about our reservation... 
Since our flight had been delayed, I called the hotel's phone number on the way to make sure they still have our room. Nancy (who is super nice!) remembered me from a couple of weeks prior and assured me that the room is there waiting for us. When we got there the lobby felt safe and welcoming. Jermaine checked us in who was also very courteous and personable. Sure enough, we had the room on the 3rd floor as Nancy promised.
The room was nice, mostly clean (the surfaces could have been cleaner - there were a few cup rings showing on the nightstand and dressers.) The sheets were nice and clean and the bed was pretty comfortable. The appearance of the room is a little outdated so it could use some fresh paint (instead of slightly crinkling wallpaper). The bathroom should be bleached more often as we did notice little spots of black mold on the grout between some of the tiles. It wasn't excessive by any means, but there shouldn't be any. The vents could use some deep cleaning too. We were told they are remodeling the hotel room by room so that should solve most of these issues. We had a nice view to the beautiful courtyard.
Of course, we have to mention the low-flow toilet... per building code (if it is for water conservation, it actually doesn't work as intended since you use about 4-5 times more water compared to 'normal-flow' toilets). There is a warning posted in the bathroom to flush often - just take it seriously and it will be okay, if not, there is a plunger.
(Our room was by the vending machines which was nice. However, the vending machines needed some more snacks... It was great to have the water bottles so close though.)
Pool was nice and clean.
BREAKFAST is really great! Sonia and Elvira work real hard to make sure everyone is happy and gets fed. Delicious omelets, waffles, and a nice variety of other goodies to kick start your day.
The location is relatively nice - you can find a few places to eat within walking distance. We saw some homeless people, but they don't seem to bother anyone. The hotel feels nice and safe.
We loved the view from the balcony in the morning.
I would recommend it to friends and would come back if we're in the area.

Neotran,3,,2014-10-31,COUPLES,2014-10-10,1,Terrible services,"My wife and I were staying in the hotel for 5 nights and wish we would not have booked the hotel. In the first day, we were arranged in a very noisy room with a broken air-con. The next day we asked for changing to another room but still not be better. The worse happened on the 2nd day of our stay; we went out and bought some panties then left our shopping stuff in the room (there is no safe in the room); then the day after we went out again with the no-room-service tag on the door but when we came back the room was serviced (not as clean as we expected) and we realised we lost 3 pairs of panties (it's like someone entered our room and looked for everything carefully). We reported to the hotel the first time, they promised to contact in the afternoon but no hear anything. The day we checked out we asked the hotel again and what they said was they are not responsible for that. Plus, when we were talking to the hotel, I witnessed another man reporting his lost in his room. What kind of service is that for a hotel in Hollywood?!

Some area around the hotel look a bit run down but over all not bad. The breakfast is great especially the made to order omelet bar with all fresh veggies. The rooms and hotel infrastructure is kinda out dated and could use an upgrade. Over all it's a very comfortable hotel for the price and location.

Stay here to escape the hustle and bustle of downtown Hollywood which is only 4 stops away by train, which you can catch close to the hotel.

The purpose of our trip was for sightseeing, and therefore were away from the hotel most of the time, but that said when we woke we enjoyed breakfast (although there could be more variety which is not down to the staff Hugo and Maria who are working with the food they are given available to them), and always returned to a clean and made up room.

The staff were always pleasant and knowledgeable and were on hand to answer any of our questions. 

Our only regret is not to make more use of the pool.","Our room was facing the main road and therefore traffic at all hours.  If you have earplugs you will be fine.  We did consider changing however when we walked into the courtyard which is used for smoking, the rooms that face into the courtyard I assume would get the stench of cigarettes smell and being non smokers we were happy not to breath this in as my partner is expecting.  The rooms at the back of the hotel near the pool I imagine would be quieter but overlook a car park.  There is also noise generated by the extractor fan in the bathroom which is the same across the rooms in our vicinity, and on a couple of times I was woken up at night by the bathroom either side of us.  If an when a refurb is planned to take place this is something that should be looked at as I&#39;m sure there are more low sound generating ones on the market.",,4.0,,4.0,3.0,,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-04-30,"Dear Guest,

AudreySanderson,288,"Northampton, United Kingdom",2014-09-30,COUPLES,2014-09-15,4,Excellent location and the best hotel in its price range,"As long as you don't go to this hotel expecting the Radisson (or similar), you will be extremely pleased.  The location is excellent - if travelling by metro, take the station to Santa Monica/Vermont, and walk up a block to the hotel, if driving, parking is $20 per night (but you can go in and out as much as you please - given the cost of parking around LA, eg. at Universal, you can justleave the car and take the metro to the main hotspots).

The rooms and decor are dated, but everything is clean, comfortable and functional.  Check in is at 3, check out at 11.  The staff are extremely helpful, and the complimentary breakfast is excellent (omelette and waffles freshly cooked to order, as well as cold meats, cheeses, fruit and breads (including croissants and muffins)).  There is even sugar free maple syrup!

The air conditioning is a little noisy, and some of the balconies are linked which means that if someone is having a chat outside - the noise easily carries as they move in front of your doors!  The bar is also a little on the ""dark"" side - more a ""pub"" bar rather than what you might imagine a hotel bar to be.  

If you take a short walk back down towards the metro, there is a great healthy-eating outlet, alongside frozen yoghurt, Pizza Hut, Staples and a pharmacy (which also does food).  Walk up towards Hollywood are the ""diner/restaurant"" type places.

The pool is excellent - the area is a sun trap, and towels are brought.  The fitness centre is also ok - again ""functional"" is the best way to describe it.

Having seen some of the other places that were in the same price range, the Hollywood Hotel is BY FAR the best value for money on offer in the area.  We would stay there again.",,5.0,4.0,,,4.0,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-12-18,"Dear Guest,

Lil_tash87,2,,2014-08-31,NONE,2014-09-12,4,I loved it!,"Well I made the mistake of repeatedly checking the reviews of the hotel AFTER we booked and started to regret my decision. 

Luckily, I was pleasantly surprised. We had a very warm welcome and were given enough information. I was happy with the free wifi even though it played up sometimes. The room was perfect, couldn't fault it at all. Bathroom was very clean and bed was comfy. 

I didn't go in the pool but I did lounge next to it one evening and it was very relaxing.

The location was great as you could get the bus and metro from just outside. We only put $20 each on our TAP card (like Ldn's Oyster) and it lasted the whole week. The only thing that let it down was the homeless people in the area. It wasn't the safest but saying that, we had no trouble and everyone was very nice and helpful. There were a lot of food places, supermarkets and other shops nearby. My friend who resides downtown came to see me and told me I had found a diamond in the rough with this hotel lol. 

Breakfast was also quite good, loved how they made eggs to your liking but they need more than one person doing it as a massive queue would build quickly. 

Staff were very polite and helpful with directions although one female was notably moody with us towards the end of our stay. We didn't take it personally though lol. They let us check out late too and wait in the lobby for our lift to the airport. 

I would stay again, it's worth the money :-)

Meagan C,6,"Everett, Washington",2014-09-30,NONE,2014-09-03,4,"Very nice, clean rooms and secure gated parking.","I had been pretty skeptical of the place from the reviews on TripAdvisor but when my husband and I got there, it seemed fine. I understand where people were coming from with the location's environment but the parking is gated so I didn't feel concerned about our car. The hotel itself was very clean and the staff were very polite. 

The room we stayed in was clean but a little small. The bathroom was nice and clean. The fact that the floors in the bedroom were made of a sort of plastic-like wood was nice if you were still wet and didn't want to walk on wet carpet afterwards.

And I had wanted to make sure that we stayed in a nice hotel for our honeymoon and I believe I found it with this hotel.

sunilKw,48,"Kuwait City, Kuwait",2014-08-31,FAMILY,2014-09-02,4,Great place for Family,This is a nice hotel with big rooms especially for families with kids to stay. It is about 100meters from the Metro Station and bus stop. very close to amenities stores and restaurants as there are no working restaurants in the hotel except during breakfast. the hotel has a laundry room also which was very convenient for us as we stayed there for 6 nights and didn't have to go out for doing our laundry. Breakfast buffet is amazing with a wide variety to offer though we have to wait for a while for the eggs as there are only 2 egg stations. The swimming pool is small and located at the back of the hotel near the parking lot but we seemed to be having problems with our cards to enter the pool and had to always get someone from reception to open the gates. Would definitely recommend this hotel,we got a room at the ground floor but I was told that the room on the 3rd floor has a good view especially of the Hollywood sign,4.0,4.0,,,,4.0,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-12-18,"Dear Guest,

Joost7,340,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",2014-08-31,FRIENDS,2014-08-30,1,Terrible!,"I visit a lot of hotels per year and this one is the worst I've ever experienced! Do NOT stay in this hotel! I'll explain why:

First of all the staff was extremely unfriendly and unwilling to help. Our sheets were dirty upon arrival, so we asked for new ones. After asking four (4!!!!!) times, one of the staffmember arrived, but we had to help him changing the sheets. When I'm paying that much per night, I, first of all, expect clean sheets and, secondly, if they are not clean I expect the hotel to take care of it. We wanted two beds, in stead of one small queen bed (as we requested during the bookingproces months prior to our stay). But the hotelmanager just didn't care about it. If we payed $ 120 extra they would place a roll-over in the room. But then there was no room at all to open your luggage, since the rooms are already quite small and thight. The worst experience was with Nielson, some manager, who even insulted us by saying we lied about our booking and preferences.

About hygiene: I added some photo's so please take a look and make your own judgement. It is not as bad as the service, but it is certainly not clean and does not meet the standards I would expect, considering the price. But the hotel looks good from the outside, the lobby is proper as well, but the rooms are so so.

The neighbourhood was full of homeless people. We did not feel safe to leave the car outside the hotel parkinglot during the night. We didn't feel safe walking at night as well (I've walked in most European city's during the night and some other big cities like NY, SF, Las Vegas, Dubai, Singapore, Bangkok, etc). 

Additionally the license of the elevator was passed several months. But I think the hotel wouldn't care if something happend to their customers.",,,1.0,1.0,,2.0,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-12-18,"Dear Guest,

Liora T,17,"Leeds, United Kingdom",2014-08-31,FAMILY,2014-08-27,4,Great Hotel for a family,"We are a family of 5 and stayed at the Hollywood Hotel between the 18th-22nd August. 

This hotel as a lot of bad reviews so we were sceptical about our stay but had no problems whatsoever.

We were placed in two large rooms next door to each other at the end of the top floor so it was extremely quiet. Both rooms were spotless and the beds were very comfy. There was no safe however which was slightly annoying. 

We went to the the pool twice which was lovely, with comfy loungers and a good sized pool to chill out in before we went out for dinner.

The breakfast is as good as everyone talks about. There was plenty of juice to meet your needs.

In terms of the neighbourhood which a lot of people commented on, I don't have much to say. We hired a car so we never went walking outside the hotel, but the metro was nearby. However parking was dear! We parked cheaper for the whole day in Beverly Hills than we did at the hotel for $22 a day.

bradr879,716,"Toronto, Canada",2014-08-31,COUPLES,2014-08-20,5,This will be a lengthy read!,"First off. After reading thru most of the comments. A lot of people complain about the surroundings outside of the hotel and not really much to what's actually inside. Don't talk to them they wont bother you. So simple!

My girlfriend and I (well now fiancé!) Looked thru many hotels online before we decided to make reservations. Our choices came down to either Travelodge down the street and this one. After reading responses back and forth and communicating with people who left feedbacks about the actual services and amenities we chose the Hollywood Hotel.

If you are looking to situate yourself within travelling distance of the typical Hollywood attractions than this is it. 

We were not sure of the distance of locations hence we rented a car. The only con I have about this place is the parking fee. 20 something a night is a little erratic seeing our rental was only 26.00 a day.. The only reason we needed a car was to get to Disney Land which was based in Anaheim (although can be accessed by transit) and to Santa Monica (which can also be accessed by transit yet a car was primarily needed for my proposal purposes)

Transit is very easy to get to. Walk one block and you will be at Vermont/Santa Monica station (Red Line) which can easily take you to the main part of Hollywood, Sunset Blvd, Downtown LA, Griffith Park, Universal Studios and even close to the airport (Bob Hope in Burbank)

Now to the hotel amenities. Let me begin by saying we had a room facing the inner courtyard. Room 217 to be exact. We are a quiet couple and this was perfect. The courtyard was another beautiful piece of the hotel. Our room which I was really scared based on review was nothing at all that was mentioned. In fact when we arrived I had asked if we can get one of the updated rooms which none were available at the time. This scared me even more. Well updated or not I very much was satisfied with the room we received. Everything was clean and seemed fairly updated to me. The bathroom was very clean as well. Maybe the iron could do with an upgrading but meh how often do you actually use it? The hallways were very clean. We did not get to use the pool and sauna that was offered, but nonetheless very very clean. To those who make comments about the cleanliness then you should seek the 5+ stars and dish out over 200 a night, but for this place and for what you pay, it's nothing but a bargain. 

Staff : I want to commend each and every one my fiancé and I interacted with. Nothing but kindness and attentiveness to any of our queries.

Now when you hear continental breakfast you think the plain standard cereal bagels and some fruit...... I think this place needs a new category on the type of continental breakfast they serve. It should be called ""beyond continental breakfast"" ok corny title but I shall explain why.

I apologize for not remembering the first person that made us breakfast (I think her name was Orillia) but for the next 5 mornings we met the famous Hugo. Where have you heard of a Continental breakfast serving personalized omelets and eggs and every day a diff. type of waffle? Yes they had the standard foods of bread, baked goods, cereals, juices, fruits tea and coffee, but again for what you pay to stay here and with all this included; Definitely worth it.

Would I come back here again? YES
After telling my family and friends about this place and its locality to everything. I hope this place lasts for a long time.",,,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-12-18,"Dear Guest,

Sarah M,1,,2014-08-31,COUPLES,2014-08-10,4,A pretty good deal!,"Despite what some of the negative reviewers say, this place is pretty nice.  Yes, it's not the Ritz-Carlton, but it's not a cheap sleazy place also. My husband and I stayed for 7 nights. We found it pleasant. I do have some things I didn't like but not enough for me to hate or not like the place. The staff there are warm and inviting. Anna, who helped us at the front desk, was patient and kind. The cleaning staff were amazing and made sure our stay was comfortable. The hotel isn't far from the Vermont/Santa Monica Metro stop which is a plus. As for the area, please don't judge a book by its cover. :) My husband and I went to the Rite Aide down the block from the hotel a few times. We even ventured to the nearest Bank of America up the road. The locals were nice and helpful. Everyone we talked in the area were friendly and made sure to tell us about some local hot spots. Really everyone in the LA area we spoke to were helpful. Breakfasts everyday were a nice way to start the day. Hugo is friendly and puts a smile on your face.  He will make your eggs or waffles to your specifications, or really anything you want with what he can give you at his station. You just simply need to ask. :)  He is amazing with people who speak other languages. The courtyard is stunning. It's a nice and quiet place to enjoy take-out or kick back with a glass of wine. The rooms were cozy with extreme AC ventilation. It can get too cold. Not really a bad thing after being under the California sun all day. It was nice to have a fridge and microwave for bringing back leftovers.  The coffee in the rooms were pretty decent, too. We stayed in the corner on the first floor towards a side alley. We had some noise of people walking by or people walking down the halls late at night, but nothing that kept us up at night. If you like hard or stiff beds, you will like this place. I don't care for them personally, but got adjusted after a couple of nights. The tub was large, so taking a hot bath after a long day of sight-seeing was nice. The wi-if was so-so. The networks they had was a hit or miss some nights. Either way, it was nice to use it and upload pictures. We brought a laptop so we could easily plug in an Ethernet cord.","Try to get a room facing the courtyard, you&#39;ll get the quiet and sound of the water fountain to doze off to. Be respectful and polite to the staff there. They really do aim to please and make your stay welcoming and relaxing. My one huge negative about the place was booking our Starline tours through them. The charges were way overpriced than what they usually are if you simply walk up to a ticket booth to purchase tickets. We did the hop-on-and-off tour for 72 hours and went to Universal Studios where they picked us up and dropped us off at the hotel. The hop-on-and-off tour sn&#39;t worth what we purchased at the hotel. Please buy your tickets at the actual ticket booth at various stops in the area. As for the Universal Studios packages, the fee is somewhat understandable for a driver to come pick and drop you off. You pay more for the convenience, but it still felt way too high of an amount for tickets. I would avoid booking through the hotel.",,5.0,3.0,,,5.0,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-30,"Dear Guest,

K2direct,18,"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",2014-08-31,BUSINESS,2014-08-09,3,Okay Hotel,"Okay, truth be told, when I first arrived I considered finding another hotel. The location is so-so.  Not some place you are going to want to walk around. And the exterior looked kind of tired. But it's not far from Los Feliz, which is very nice and near the Vermont Ave. metro stop which is convenient. I took the metro to Hollywood and Highland and it is safe, fast and well-run. Way better than dealing with the crazy traffic and lack of parking in that area. 

This place looks more like a motel than a hotel. I thought the hallways were kind of dark. And I arrived an hour early to check-in time and was told to leave and come back. Really? The bathroom has some cracked tiles and rusted metal parts and you wouldn't want to take a bath in the tub.(It's clean, but has that kind of permanent film thing that can happen over time if it is not scrubbed really well.) First time I showered the tub filled to near the top in five minutes. I reported it and the then the next time if only half filled, so I let it go. There is no closet in the room. There is instead a hanging rack bolted to the wall. None of the furniture matches and the the TV stand doubled as a desk for me. I like that there are no carpets but rather wood (or synthetic wood) floors. Felt cleaner to me. The bed was comfortable. There was a little balcony that overlooked a cute courtyard and the room I had was surprisingly quiet. The balcony connects to the room next door so be sure to keep the glass door locked.Other than the original person I dealt with, the desk staff was nice. I never got around to the free breakfast so I can't comment on that. Parking is gated with an attendant at the exit and costs $24 a day.

This was a last minute trip so I didn't have many hotels to choose from in my price range. I've stayed at much nicer L.A. area hotels for the same price or less. I won't come back to this one, but if you can get a room for a good price it is okay. Clean, safe and basic.",,3.0,3.0,,3.0,,,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-04-30,"Dear Guest

Amber B,6,"Poquoson, Virginia",2014-07-31,COUPLES,2014-08-04,3,Positives and Negatives,"Hotel was located between 1-5 miles to everywhere we wanted to visit.  Metro station’s less than one block away.  Breakfast was delicious.  Offerings including fresh made omelets, waffles, hash browns, sausage links, assorted bread, cereal, oatmeal, fruit, juices, tea and coffee.  Be aware that you are only allowed to have one omelet per day.  My boyfriend went to get a second omelet and the chef Hugo yelled at him and told him he could only have one per day.  Small gym with weight equipment and treadmills.  Pool is nice. Has comfortable lounge chairs and umbrellas for shade.  My room overlooked the courtyard on third floor and was very quiet. 
 
Surrounding area is not very nice. Saw a roach the first night. My room was not upgraded as I had seen in some of the recent Trip Advisor pictures.  Mold in the bathroom and walls were dirty.  The tub was gross.  Room had a terrible musky smell that gave me a headache.  Elevators are extremely slow.  Our fire alarm went off at 5am one morning.  Woke us up and the neighbors.   Room was very small. No closet.  Not allot of room to move around.  

Location was awesome.  Room not so great.",Get a room on a higher floor overlooking courtyard or back parking lot.,4.0,3.0,,,2.0,,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-12-18,"Dear Guest,

NHGuest,12,"Los Angeles, California",2014-07-31,NONE,2014-08-04,3,Mediocre hotel with free breakfast,"For anyone looking for a glamorous hotel in the prime location of Hollywood, you'll be disappointed. The room is tight and not very modern. There is however complementary breakfast which may somewhat offset the lack of food choices in the typical LA neighborhood (busy & safe but not Beverly Hills).

An important safety issue to note is that you must make sure to fully close the door. Once I walked into the wrong room because that guest's room wasn't locked despite being closed. Later I discovered the door in my room was also not fully secured. I suspect the doors are old and quiet loose. Be sure to tighten the door handle when you go out.

This is really a hit and miss hotel depending on what rate you get the room at.

Mark W,10,"Perth, Australia",2014-06-30,FAMILY,2014-07-31,1,Dodgy charging practices,"The hotel and it's facilities were good, and it is well located near subway station. We booked through expedia and got the spa suite which advertised it slept up to 4 people and an infant. We'd stayed in similar rooms and assumed it had a sofa bed. It was paid for and closer to the date we arrived we were told that we would need to pay extra for a roll out bed. When we queried this they advised that the room only had a king bed and although it advertises for up to 4 people we would need to hire the extra bed.

Expedia were very helpful and eventually refunded that amount to us, but their advertising and charging left a sour taste.

Also, be careful if you hire from Advanced car, which is located at Hollywood Hotel. We booked a car after seeing the price advertised on the counter. When we went to collect it, the car actually cost $10 more than the advertised price. And despite the cars being parked at the hotel overnight when not rented, they charge for parking if you do rent the car.

It is miles away from Hollywood, in Vermont, or Downtown LA. it is on a main road. The staff are surly and unhelpful. When I asked whether someone could help my 2 daughters and I with our luggage, I may as well have been speaking a different language. Rooms old fashioned, uncomfortable and over priced. When we encountered a cockroach in our room ( I kid you not), the manageress seemed put out at my request to go to another room ( it was too late to transfer), and argued with me about whether the rate/cost would be waived. We obviously checked out first thing the next day.

TheEgertons,1,"Calgary, Canada",2014-07-31,NONE,2014-07-26,4,Pretty good.,"The Hollywood Hotel is a pretty no frills place, but for the traveler more concerned with what's happening outside the hotel rather than in, it's just right. The mini fridge in the room was perfect for holding beers and sangria, and the microwave even came in useful when we found ourselves snacking on leftovers for one dinner.

The pool is a lovely place to cool down on especially hot LA days, although its closing time of 8pm is a little premature in my opinion.

The housekeeping staff do a wonderful job of keeping your room tidy, although we were perplexed to find coca - cola splashed on our bathroom door, which was apparently missed by them before we checked in.

The free continental breakfast is a nice option, as it helps cut down on some of your trip expenses,  and has enough variety to keep you coming back.

Park rates are a bit of a rip, but so is parking everywhere in LA.

Overall, the Hollywood Hotel is an uncomplicated, affordable, and rather pleasant place to stay during your time in the City of Angels.",,4.0,4.0,,3.0,4.0,3.0,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-30,"Dear Guest,

TravelbugA350,116,"Birmingham, United Kingdom",2014-06-30,NONE,2014-07-05,3,It's alright! Not great!,"I stayed here on the 20th of June for a few nights. I was very worried as I had booked this hotel by mistake and read the reviews and how bad it was and desperately wanted to change hotels but I couldn't. I just had to grim and bear it.
To my surprise, this hotel is not nowhere as near as bad as some people are making it out to be. I will not exaggerate anywhere in this when I write this.
Upon arrival, I was greeted by friendly staff who seemed like they wanted to help but I couldn't help but notice the very obvious scent of cigarette smile looming in the seating area of the lobby: this was quite concerning as they emphasized how this hotel was a non-smoking hotel. Not a great first impression of a hotel.
We were quickly checked in and proceeded to our room. I was on the 3rd floor and the elevator was quite slow and both the elevator and corridor smelled of stale the room was very spacious and almost very clean (I found a few peanuts on the floor and some hairs lurking around near the bed.) where the chair was situated, it seems as if someone was banging it into the wall as there were dents in the wall. Although, the bathroom was immaculate. The room was air conditioned, had a fridge and a microwave (this came in handy!) the breakfast here was amazing, a wide variety of food comfy seating, and not to mention very filling and tasty! Sonia was very helpful and friendly whenever I saw her and asking me how I'm enjoying my stay. The internet was very fast, but it kept disconnecting for some reason but it wasn't really a problem as it was so fast! The hotel offers a free gym, swimming pool, and sauna. We used the sauna nearly everyday and we loved it. The hotel itself isn't in a great neighborhood but I wouldn't call it a ghetto. Just slightly rundown. (it's in EAST Hollywood - not West Hollywood) but I always felt safe and was near the metro so I was never too far from the places I wanted to see (Hollywood walk of fame, downtown LA) Eateries near were nice and I loved the Thai food restaurants (it's my favourite!) I was quite disappointed by the lack of onsite facilities available such as a restaurant to have dinner and room service but there were eateries very near so it didn't really matter as it could be delivered to your hotel. Overall, my experience of the hotel was very very average, nothing outstanding about it or terribly bad. I would probably stay here again if I received the same offer I did when I booked it (50% off 5 international nights.) but it was a good hotel and I recommend it to anyone and it's family friendly too!",,4.0,5.0,,3.0,4.0,3.0,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-04-01,"ear Guest

Arjun S,4,"London, United Kingdom",2014-06-30,FRIENDS,2014-06-22,3,Mixed opinion!,"Me and my mate stayed for 4 days.  I personally interacted with 9 staff members in this hotel. I'll start with the good ones! Sonia, Oravia, 1 more lady behind the omelette counter & an oriental waiter. They were really sweet! They gave a personal touch to my omelette and were polite. At the reception there was a russian girl who checked us in and was very sweet, chatty and helped us out in terms of directions to move around town. There was also a room maid who spoke no english but was very sweet and tried to help.

Now not very happy about mentioning this but I guess I have to if they want really want feedback to improve. There is a Latina on the reception desk with glasses and shoulder length hair who fails miserably in faking an American accent! She needs to understand she is required to do a job which is be hospitable to guests. First thing is be approachable! As I walked up and asked something she continued to fiddle with the computer and then looked up replied and then again put her head down and started to work on her computer. She wasn't busy but was just not interested in doing her job. Then she checked us out I asked her another question relating to our expenses she just replied quickly which clearly looked like she wanted to get rid of me and then looked at my mate and gave a quick smile like she was required to do so. I think she is in a wrong job. Same applies to the boys at the reception desk! They need to smile more and not act smart! The bar owner or manager with long hair and a cap was really rude too!!!! 

All in all I would still say I didn't let them spoil my stay and I am still happy about meeting the lovely staff in the breakfast room and the russian girl at the reception desk. Others need more training!!!

About the location yes the metro station is a 2 minute walk so it's good. But we mainly had to Santa Monica and weho which are connected by bus 4 and 7. They are a bit slow and the wait for them is frustrating. Every night we had two heavily painted ladies in fish net tights and skimpy shorts opposite the street smoking a cigarette greeted us with a smile and flexed their legs every time we walked by. And there was a cop like 100 ft away would look the other way. It is a shabby area but I didn't feel that intimidated that much to be honest. Just mind your own business you ll be fine. 
The trip and the weekend was fun though! N o yes the bed sheets and towels were clean and the shower had continuos hot water. The rooms were also cleaned well.",We took a room on the 2nd level facing the street and we were happy.,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-04-30,"Dear Guest,

Neil W,9,"Dorset, United Kingdom",2014-06-30,FAMILY,2014-06-16,3,Perfectly adequate as a base,"We stayed at the Hollywood Hotel after 5 nights in a luxury hotel in Las Vegas. This was a mistake. We should have reversed the holiday and started in LA. The Hollywood Hotel is certainly not what it appears to be in the brochures. It is tired and dark inside. However, the staff are very friendly and helpful and the breakfast is very good. The housekeeping staff do a good job and the rooms are clean. It is a $20 taxi ride from downtown LA, the Hollywood Walk Of Fame and Starline Tours (which offer just about every tour you could wish for) and 5 minutes walk from the nearest Metro station. 15 minutes walk away are some very reasonable restaurants. HOWEVER, to walk anywhere you will have to pass vagrants sleeping on many of the benches on the pavements. They do not cause much trouble but they stink. The pavements smell badly of urine and the rest. We passed one shamelessly urinating on the pavement which offended and upset our daughter. 
If the Hollywood Hotel (with its current staff) was located in a better area and brighter bulbs fitted (and a lick of paint applied) it would be a decent enough place to stay. We had a good time but it could have been better.",Don&#39;t take a room on the ground floor especially if it is facing the courtyard.

GigiK1,21,"Perth, Australia",2014-06-30,FAMILY,2014-06-16,4,Great hotel,"After reading the many reviews about the Hollywood Hotel I was keen to make my own judgement. For the price we paid it was a great hotel. It's not a 5 star hotel so it's unreasonable to expect the same service and details that five star promises. I did enjoy the complimentary breakfast and the omelettes, although good, were not the amazing creations that I had been anticipating after reading all the reviews. I did wonder why the illustrious Hugo received so many accolades on Trip Advisor and was able to find out for myself. The omelette and waffle makers hand out TA cards with their name on it asking for good reviews. Although this is not so bad, I find it a little contrived. I would like to mention Anna at front desk, who did not ask for a good review. She was professional, friendly, without being over familiar and very helpful. In all a great hotel with a great location. And to the occasional few who have reviewed this hotel and complained about the homeless people sleeping outside....you are scumbags who don't deserve the lifestyles you are lucky to have.",Definitely ask for a room facing the courtyard...very nice,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-30,"Dear Guest,

Rooms were clean and beds were comfortable. They had free breakfast in the morning which was awesome! The hotel is also very close to the subway which we used to get to the marathon instead of paying for parking. In LA you have to pay for parking everywhere you go basically. The hotel parking was reasonably priced.

amanda_cardiff,10,,2013-07-31,FRIENDS,2014-06-15,3,Comfortable hotel in LA,"We had a week to spend in LA and as it was our first visit, we wanted to be close to the sights but not pay over the odds.
We found a good deal at this hotel and had a lovely stay here. The hotel is about a 5 minute walk to the nearest metro station which meant we could easily get to Hollywood Blv/Universal studios etc.
We stayed in the Spa Suite as that's all that was available when we booked. The room was massive however a little dark due to lack of windows and poor lighting. There was always room to park in the car park and always space at the pool (pool became shady very early in the evening due to the hotel building but this I suppose is expected in a city full of high rise buildings). The only negative to the spa room is the proximity to the vending and ice machines so our nights were a little disturbed.
We had to call the front desk one night as the room next to us had an alarm going off at 1am. We called the front desk after it had been going on for more than 30 minutes but they said they weren't able to access the room as it was supposedly occupied. We heard the front desk trying to ring their phone but obviously there was no-one in the room. We had to endure an alarm going off until the occupants returned at 4am. Whilst it's not the hotels fault an alarm was going off, they could have done more to try and turn it off.
We had breakfast included every morning which was the average breakfast you get in a hotel. It was more than enough though to start a day of sight seeing.
Whilst this hotel was cheap enough, I wouldn't stay here again as I'm sure there are other competitively priced hotels in the area. Average hotel but not anything special.",,4.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-04-30,"Dear Guest,

It was my first trip to America and we arrived at 6am where none of us had slept on our flight.  We arrived at the Hotel well before check in (6 hours early) but the staff could not have been move friendly and helpful.  They checked us into our rooms where we were able to have a hot shower and freshen up for the day.  They helped us with maps contacts best places to go even where to obtain a sim card for our phone and phone plan.  Rooms were small but very clean and again staff were fantastic.  Location was close to supermarket and subway which we used extensively.  There is courtyard area which we would meet with friends for drinks in the evening. There is safe boxes at reception if you are concerned with leaving valuables in the room.  The whole experience here was a great start to our holiday.  Breakfast was also included in our cost and it was lovely fresh and omelettes made to order.  When we first pulled up at the hotel in the rear I was kinda of concerned with the area but don't judge until you have stayed because I guarantee you will be very happy with the service and the property.

The hotel is out-dated but clean and the staff helpful.  The breakfast was filling.  We did not use the pool, fitness room or convenience store but it was nice to have them.

Gunnar K,4,"Drammen, Norway",2014-06-30,FRIENDS,2014-06-13,5,Huge rooms!,"I arrived here after a full day of travel all the way from Scandinavia.
The hotel staff has been very friendly and helpful all the way.
I especially enjoyed starting every day with eggs and waffles cooked just they way you'd like it.
I recommend the chef Hugo who were really nice meeting my omelette-filling needs. 
The location of the hotel is somewhat between downtown and Hollywood, but a bit far away from LAX if you travel by plane.
I recommend calling the hotel ahead to arrange for a shuttle to pick you up/drive you to the airport compared to taxi.
The hotel has a nice yard in the center of the estate with sofas and chairs, also in the back they have a pool complete with sun-beds.
The housekeepers did an excellent job every day and works efficiently.
Wi-fi works well, except for in the breakfast area.

Overall a really nice stay, the only thing that irritates me was the extremely slow-moving elevator.
If I ever go back to LA, I'd be sure to check availability of Hollywood hotel.'

There is a huge video game convention going on in town so finding a room in the city at a reasonable rate was difficult. Because we had plans to visit Universal Studios we were looking for something in the northern Hollywood area and this place was only a few exits down the freeway. Was really not expecting much but this place has a really great homey vibe. Try to get a room facing the courtyard if you can. For the price and location (If you plan to do a lot of sightseeing in Hollywood) I can't recommend this place enough. I have already told my girlfriend the next time we come to Hollywood we are staying here. 
I was a little apprehensive when we were first driving here because you have to drive through some seedy streets to get here but we ventured out at night and had no problems.

Our room had a hot tub in it, which was awesome after walking around all day - it's not deep though so can only really be in it a foot or so. House keeping did a very fast job off the room, went out to grab breakfast and came back to room done - couldn't have been more than 2 hours.

Melissitaaa,1,,2014-06-30,FRIENDS,2014-06-04,4,Best hotel in the area!,"The pros:

This hotel has easy access to Hollywood and other attractions and restaurants. 

First of all, let me start by saying they do not serve your average ""free breakfast"" ; they serve THE BEST breakfast you could imagine! From fresh orange juice & lemonade, to omelette, home-made waffles, and a variety of foods. It was my favorite part! Hugo & Elvira were great, friendly, and I liked how they remembered my friend and I after the first day we went. The restaurant area is very nice, as well as the patio area in the middle where the bar is.

The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. 

From the front it may not look so pretty, but the back entrance where the parking is, is beautiful! I saw the pool but did not get in, but it's small and private.

The parking is secure, but the gate when you get your ticket is quick to close, seeing as I had to get out because my arms are too short to reach. (short people problems)

There is a convenient shop on the bottom floor towards the parking that is low price. I ended up buying a carry on with wheels for $10 because my carry on broke. I also got sunburned and bought aloe-vera lotion and after-sun gel for under $5!

The beds and pillows were very comfy! The comforter was really nice, thick and fluffy. Bed was stiff, great for my back!

The AC is icy cold! Works perfect, and if it gets too cold and you want to turn it down, it works quick.

The room was very spacious, as well as the bathroom. There is a microwave and mini-fridge available, as well as coffee & a hair dryer.

The cons:

The lower level bathrooms by the front desk were not soo nice. Those looked old compared to the ones in the bathroom.

The room key did not always work when going up/down the stairs, or to the bathroom downstairs.

The elevator move EXTREMELY slow! I used the stairs the whole time because I felt like it was going to get stuck at any moment. 

The floor in the bedroom looked clean, but stepping in them in light colored socks, you saw the socks turn dark.

We left the ""do not disturb"" sign on the handle before my friend and I went out (both of us girls) because we left clothes/ make-up/ hair stuff out around the bed and did not want the room cleaned since we still had not made up our minds, but room was still cleaned, thus, sign was ignored.

Overall, we did explore the city and surrounding areas; this was one of the nicer hotels for the price, great area, excellent staff, nice on the inside. We had a pleasant stay. Would book again.",Streets all over Hollywood area are not great after 9pm. Had room #340 (towards parking lot) &amp; it was quiet.,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-30,"Dear Guest,

KarenK1961,25,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",2014-05-31,FAMILY,2014-06-01,2,Not Worth it,"We booked this hotel as it seemed pretty central and large rooms.  Firstly I would like to point out that this hotel has no bell boy/concierge/porter, call it what you like they were non existent which means your responsible for your luggage, so if you are unable or unwilling to take your luggage to your room it will stay in reception. The first room we were given was very spacious but very dated, the bed was on a metal base and would squeak every twist and turn and the lights where difficult to turn on or off and would occasionally flicker, when I explored this it led me to a hole in the wall behind my bed that the light fitting was plugged into, not too safe with a metal bed base i thought, I then looked at other safety issues to find that there was no sprinklers in the rooms just a small smoke detector on the wall.  Because of the bed issue i asked to change rooms, the staff were very polite and very helpful and found a room with a less squeaky bed, again though the same safety issues.  The bathroom had no ventilation and the shower was long and narrow with a low ceiling that would drip water on you if you stayed in the shower too long or had it too hot.  There was no information in the room about hotel facilities we were told were to find breakfast but that was it, it took me 4 days to find the entrance shown in the photo, it is in the parking lot if your interested and I never found a pool.  The bar we discovered one night it was dull and dingy and had stand up comics who picked on us and made us feel uncomfortable. Breakfast was good as it was free but the pastries were a bit stale, but fresh eggs were always available.  What this hotel needs is life, it is in need of a huge make over it is very tired, grubby, shabby and old. You were supplied tea bags but no kettle to boil water only a coffee machine and paper cups to drink it from.  On a good side we had quiet rooms on both occasions seeing as it was on a main road, but were told not to leave to ranch slider open at night because it was a bad area.","Ask for a room at the rear overlooking the parking lot, it is very quiet considering",2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,,,,,7

Amanda M,1,"Conway, Arkansas",2014-05-31,COUPLES,2014-05-20,1,"RUDE STAFF, TERRIBLE NEIGHBORHOOD!","Google Street View this place before booking it!!! It is in East Hollywood and is not a family friendly neighborhood. The picture of the hotel show on the website is actually the back of the hotel, viewed from the parking lot. Hello - False Advertising? The front of the hotel is not as aesthetically pleasing as the photo magic makes it out to be.

The staff were very rude (except for the cleaning ladies, they were nice). We tried desperately to get a hold of the General Manager, which of course, was never on duty, never on site. We asked the front desk several times to speak with the GM and they said ""Oh we will email him and ask him to call us back."" Lies. Why would the staff have to email the GM? Why don't they have his/her home phone, business phone, and cell phone on speed dial?

I did look up the owner of the hotel. Jeff Zarrinnam is his name. We did not get to meet him either. I wish so much that we could have talked face to face and let him know first hand how we were treated at his hotel. I guess this place suffers from lack of management and lack of interest by the owner. 

The air conditioner did not work in our room.

People smoke cigarettes in the center garden area and it stunk up the place and the smoke came inside of the rooms.

There are homeless people who live on the benches in front of the hotel.

The front desk is helpful and very kind.
They aided in your selections, cabs and general advise.

In the basement is where you will find the daily free continental breakfast, a super plus!

On most nights you can catch an amazing comedy show in the basement, an added treat!! The drinks are cheap and the shows are free:)

The gym is pretty small, but does the trick and the pool is outside.

Jason N,291,"Newport Beach, California",2014-05-31,COUPLES,2014-05-12,1,DO NOT STAY HERE!!!! WARNING!!!!,"DO NOT BELIEVE THE WEBSITE! There is NO air conditioning. Final warning. There is a ""thermostat"" on the wall in the room. However, this controls the fan only. There is NO setting for A/C or heat. The HVAC system utilized in this building is the old ""Water Type"", meaning that water tubes are ran throughout the building, instead of air ducts. The fans in each room blow air over the tubes. The temperature of the air is determined by the temperature of the water in the tubes. Heat rises. So in reality, the higher the floor, the hotter the air. When the hot air blows over the tubes of hot water (the temperature of the water in the tubes the is also hotter on each ascending floor, due to the ambient air surrounding each tube), the result is hot air. Humidity is not removed in these types of systems. Instead, the return vent is located inside the bathroom and the hot air keeps circulating in the same room. The hot steamy output is blown over the bedroom. The current temperature outside is 84 degrees Fahrenheit. The temperature in the room cannot magically lower itself. Instead, the humidity keeps rising in the room and the environment becomes more and more uncomfortable throughout the course of the day. There is a balcony door that can be opened to allow hot, but drier air, into the room. Leaving the door open throughout the night helps cool the room, but this is very dangerous, because the balconies are not private. The balconies are shared with 3-4 rooms, depending on location in the building. So suffer hot steamy nights, or risk being robbed, raped, or terrorized by a ""neighbor"".

We complained for 3 days/nights about the air situation. The service staff at the front desk would always say ""We are having problems with the third floor, will send someone up."" or ""I understand, let me have the General Manager contact you."" Never heard from any manager. On the third night we argued with the front desk enough to make them realize that we had the superior intellect necessary to operate a thermostat and they FINALLY sent a ""technician"" up to check the HVAC. He walked into the room, looked at the thermostat and then said ""Problem, it no work."" 

We were finally moved to a room down on the first floor on our last night. Apologies, though they lacked sincerity, were made by the Guest Services Agent (who first claimed he was a manager but later claimed he was only a supervisor and did not have the authority to do anything). His name was Michael. 

Almost every elevator is broken. It is quicker to take the stairs to get to your room (applies to second and third floors). Some elevators had buttons that you had to hit with a sledge hammer to function. The elevators were ""secure"" because you had to swipe your room key card in order for the unit to move up or down. This did not always work as designed. Sometimes the key would never register, forcing you to take the stairs. Other times you did not need to swipe the card at all. Free reign for outsiders to invade the hotel.

There is a homeless man that lives right out in front of the hotel. He was eating a can of soup, straight out of the can, when we checked in. We saw him everyday, as we came and went, just sitting or sleeping on the bench. Not the best scenery you like to see at the place your are sleeping at night. This brings me to the next point, about open doors and locked doors. Not far from where the bum slept is an entrance door that was always open every time that I checked. Again, it gave free access to the inside of the building to anyone who wanted in. Very creepy feeling. On the flip side of that, there was a balcony on the third floor that was cozy for people to sit outside and cool off from the high humidity rooms. This private balcony was locked most of the time, however, by the owner. The front desk said that it was ""The owners special area and that they could not unlock it."" Why the heck would an owner have a special place at their hotel? Did they live there?  Doesn't it make sense to leave the doors open to allow airflow to help cool the upper floor? What about fire codes? If the elevator does not work and the key card would not open the stairwell door, shouldn't the balcony be used to evacuate the building in the tragic event of a fire? We did see an old lady with white hair out there with a cat. We asked her about the cat and she pretended not to hear us at first. We persisted on asking her if that was her cat, because it was coming into the building. The cat came into the hotel hallway and meowed at us. She said ""It was the hotel's cat and that it followed her around."" She said she worked at the hotel. So, now we have stray cats (no collar, dirty) roaming the halls, really? I hope no kids ever get scratched, clawed, or bitten by a cat that could be carrying some type of disease.

Along with the hot air, stray cats, and bums, there was also a mold issue. The bathroom had black mold on the ceiling in the corners above the shower. The intake vent for the HVAC was located in one corner above the shower. The diffusers were covered in a greenish black fuzzy film. The white tile walls of the shower had black mold growing in the caulk sealant between the tiles. The bathroom door had a large gash (the paint was stripped down to the wood) where the entrance door handle collides with the outside of the bathroom door. Very trashy appearance. 

The fresh towels that were placed in the rooms everyday had brown stains on them. This applied to both rooms. It is hard to take a shower and feel clean when the towels that you use to dry off with have brown stains of unknown origin. Were they at least washed with hot water? How about laundry detergent? 

In our first room the night stand with the alarm clock had no electricity. The adjacent lamp did not work either. They were both plugged into an extension cord which ran under the bed and plugged into the outlet on the other side of the bed. I checked to ensure all connections and plugs were seated correctly but the lamp and clock never worked. This was very inconvenient because the only way to tell time at night was to use a cell phone. There were patched holes in both rooms on the wall with the bed head-board. Again, very trashy feeling and appearance.

The vending machines on each floor were very expensive. $2 for a pack of 5 ritz crackers and cheese scoop! $2 for a Snicker's bar or a pack of M&M's. The soda machines were also expensive, and they were mystery machines. You would put in $2.50 and press the Sprite button, only to receive a bottle of water. 

The hotel does not offer a guest computer, copier, or printer. If you needed something printed you have to email the hotel and attach your personal item as an attachment. They would then download the email and print out the attachment for you. 

Do not be fooled by secure parking! Anyone can get into the parking lot by pressing the red button on the entrance gate. The only ""security"" is the guy that takes your ticket in order to let you out of the exit gate. Yes that is right. No one is checked going in. But, if you want to leave in a car, you have to request the exit gate to be opened. This means 2 thieves could easily get in and out of the lot using the entrance gate. One presses the red button and goes in. The other presses the red button to let his partner back out. Voila! That situation would only apply if he stopped at breaking into cars. The thief could potentially walk in the door and go up the elevator that does not always function per its secure design.

Do yourself and your family a favor and piece of mind. Do NOT stay at this hotel. I've stayed in Motel 6's that seem like a 5 star resort compared to this place!

The hotel is about a seven minute walk from CHLA (probably the best Children's Hospital on the West Coast if not the US).  The hotel was clean and elegant.  We only had the chance to get breakfast once, but it was great as is widely reported elsewhere. We’d expected to need to add a couple more days since the stay at CHLA was supposed to be for six days (for heart surgery), but our son bounced right back and was discharged very early, meaning that we had one extra day book at the hotel.  I’d hoped to simply get a voucher for the last day to use at another time, but that wasn’t possible.  Cecile was the manager and very thoughtfully agreed not to charge us for the third day and we were on our way home.",,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-27,"Dear Guest,

Negatives: I specifically asked for a high courtyard renovated room. (From other comments on trip advisor) however they put us in a road room. I complained and told them but they had not kept my note on file. They moved us to courtyard room. However it was not renovated. They also charged us twice which put our account in overdraft. This took 12 days to refund us back... as they wouldnt put a credit through and we had to wait for the hold transaction to expire (useless). The areas a bit dodgey... a homeless man lives right outside. Rooms need renovated... they are a bit rough. Carpet in corridoors smells....

The room was huge the only problem we seemed to have was with the fridge, the top row seemed to stay slightly cold whereas the middle shelf would freeze to ice! we bought lollies one day and they melted in here but other than that it was fine! there was plenty of storage in the room and lots of tv channels. the internet was a pain to set up at first as none of our devices wanted to connect but as soon as they connected it was fantastic throughout our stay, quick and always working! the vending machines were well stocked and the maids were fantastic at cleaning our room. the hotel rang us a taxi to go to the airport for us which worked out cheaper than where other companies had quoted us. breakfast was busy when we went down as we are not breakfast people we rarely went down for it but it was very nice when we did go down! there is a metro right down the road and the hotel offer tours aswell however we booked in advance with starline tours. we ordered food in one evening which was fab. it is an easy hotel to find with 4 huge signs around the front of the hotel, the waterfall is at the back of the hotel. it is secure with a watchman on the gate every day. our room was right next to the gym which was no problem except some guests find it ok to laugh, joke and slam the door at 6am in the morning even though the gym isn't meant to open yet and some evenings around 11pm the same thing would happen, other than that no problems. have uploaded some photos of the room as when we booked we weren't able to find any photos of the junior suite and we were on pins!",,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-27,"Dear Guest,

And the kind desk clerk even told us about an authentic Mexican cafe with take-out in walking distance. We ate our supper in the open atrium area of the hotel. That saved us a lot of cash, while providing a culinary delight!
We were there for a convention held at the LA Convention Center. The subway took us right to the convention center, and a day pass--$5/day allowed us to travel all over Hollywood, too.
We are educators, and we learned how friendly folks are in this area.",We had room 248--and all of the rooms on that sdie would have been quiet.,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-27,"Dear Guest,

Wiegand D,3,,2014-03-31,FAMILY,2014-03-29,4,Great Staff!!,"I enjoyed the hotel at every turn. It pleasantly surprized myself and my wife. We expected something more dated but really it was a great hotel. Well decorated, good rooms (slightly smallish, we felt could have been 3 feet wider), wide hallways, secure parking, marble floors throughout ground floor, quiet court yard great for reading. 

The staff was great and I connected well with Ekaterina who showed professionalism, enthusiasm and went the extra effort to explain policy and any questions I had.

The only complaint was the excessive cost of parking ($22/day) which brings up the overall cost of the hotel... so add this into your hotel estimate.",,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-30,"Dear Guest,

Everything about the hotel was positive!  Our room was very clean with comfortable beds and a walk in shower.  The service was wonderful and they were very helpful!  Nancy, Bobby and Gisel were the most helpful!  I would like to let all know that they made our stay a very positive one and helped us in any way that they could.  Bobby always greeted us with a smile!  Nancy helped us with our luggage when we arrive early from our flight and the room wasn't ready.  She stored our luggage in a secure locked closet so we could start our vacation and all was there when we returned to check into our room.  Gisel helped and made anything work out so we could fully enjoy and have a very happy experience!  I would stay again if ever returning to Hollywood.  We loved the grocery/drug store on the block across the street along with the Metro on the corner block.  Could not have picked a better location for getting to the Metro easier!  We can't forget to mention the awesome fresh-made breakfast every morning!  Omelets and scrambled eggs made while you watch along with waffles.  They all were attentive to our needs and always courteous with a smile! I will share the hotel information with all my friends and family!

Nadia A,2,"Mexico City, Mexico",2014-03-31,BUSINESS,2014-03-26,2,Horrible service,"It is a very average hotel with extremely bad customer service. First, my husband needed to print out a document and was told that they could not provide such a service. Then some packages were sent to him during his stay. And although we contacted the hotel in advance to ask if there would be any fee and was told that none, at the moment of getting them he was charged 2 dollars per box. When asked why we were told there would be no charge, the answer was that probably it had been a trainee who said that by mistake, but they do not care and we must pay. It turned out that one of the packages was going to arrive late, at the day of leaving the hotel. We offered to pay for re-sending this item to another US address, but got a refusal in a rude form. Generally speaking, when speaking to the staff of the hotel, all people show zero willingness to help you, can simply cut off the call and/or do not even answer the phone. I do not think we will stay again at this hotel.",,,,,,,,,,,,4

Bill Y,17,"Fairview, Canada",2014-03-31,BUSINESS,2014-03-17,5,Great Place to Stay,"My wife and i stayed there in March 2014.  It was a great place to stay.  Some reviews I have just read speak about horrible staff, poor condition of the rooms, intermittent internet service and no AC.   Well I have a totally different story to relate.  We were treated very well by all the hotel staff, epically Bobby the night manager and Michael the manager.  Furthermore, whenever we approached the front desk we were always greeted with a smile and helped out in a timely fashion.  Perhaps some people feel that if their needs and concerns are not addressed immediately, though others are waiting, then that becomes a problem??????   If you walk down the halls you will always be greeted with a hello or good morning.  

The rooms are adequately sized, but that appears to be the norm for most hotels in major cities. The room was always clean and tidy when we returned each night. No complaints here.  The condition of the room was wonderful, the shower worked well, the TV and the AC worked without issue.  (On the Sunday of our stay it reached 31 F so it was warm outside!) The bed was wonderful (not a fan of thin pillows but I am picky that way), we fell asleep easily and no one had a sore back..  One night there was a lot of good times being had in the courtyard and the noise did filter up.   Shortly after 11:30 it died down.  Did the party goers go someplace else or did management put an end to the extraneous noise, I don't know.   The internet was never a concern. Not once in the 5 days that I stayed at the hotel did I have an issue with the internet.  It reconnected to the ipad immediately upon entering the hotel.  

Now for the centerpiece of the hotel, the breakfast.  A lot of places offer you continental style breakfasts but this place puts them all to shame.   Where else do you find 2 chefs at two different omelet stations making your whatever you wanted for breakfast?  I chose bacon, mushrooms and tomatoes but there were a lot more choices you could have mixed in to make an omelet.  (A huge thank you goes out to Hugo and Oralia)  Besides omelettes you could have waffles or eggs any other way you want them.  There are also breakfast sausages, toast and several juice choices.  The breakfast is definitely a cut above what you are traditionally served.

Safety. There are homeless people around, but then again I passed by homeless people in downtown LA near the convention center where my conference was.  There were a number of high end hotels nearby, looks like everyone has to deal with this issue.   When my wife and I were out after dark (9 pm) we did not feel threatened.  We walked approximately 5 blocks to a wonderful Thai restaurant that was located in a strip mall.  Never had an issue.  

The Metro was very handy.   I bought a TAP card and loaded it with 20 bucks.  I would walk a block and a half to the metro each morning and take the red line downtown to the convention center.  No problems to speak of.   People were helpful, helping me get to the right train and load the tap card in the first place.  Yes every now and then you meet an interesting character in the metro, never felt as though I was in any danger.   None were on the train the 3 days I rode it.  We took the train to Hollywood and Highland to Hollywood's version of the Vegas strip,   We took it all over.

People come in all shapes and sizes.  So do their expectations and how they expect to be treated.  We were treated very nicely at the Hollywood hotel, I have nothing but compliments for that place.  I would stay there again in a heartbeat.  Again thanks for the conservations Bobby and Michael and the ladies at the front desk, Thank you so so so much for your help the night I was leaving and getting help with the airlines and the shuttle company.",,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-27,"Dear Guest,

Skayy90,14,"Manchester, United Kingdom",2014-03-31,FRIENDS,2014-03-10,5,Loved it! ,"After reading the previous reviews I can't understand what people are complaining about, we loved this place! 

Big rooms, really comfy beds, good facilities in the room. 

Really close to the metro station 

Only issue was our shower wouldn't turn on as the handle was really stiff but we got moved straight away to another room. This was a bit smaller but we were willing to sacrifice a smaller room for our amazing balcony view over the patio. All you could hear at night with the balcony door open was the water fountain. So peaceful 

Breakfast was amazing especially Sonia on the hot food counter she was so friendly and helpful. She remembered us every morning and our orders! 

We can't fault it, we would definitely stay again we loved it ",,,,,,,,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-27,"Dear Guest,

Thought it was odd that the touch up paint didn't match the finishing paint. Was disgusted that there were cobwebs on the ceiling, considering that was so easy to clean. Didn't appreciate the fluctuation between hot and cold while trying to have a shower. There was zero climate control. The walls are thin and it's very loud. When we put the sign on that we didn't want housekeeping they came in any way to clean which i think is disrespectful since we aren't messy people to begin with. Will we stay here again?

queenwolf2,59,"Elgin, Illinois",2014-02-28,FAMILY,2014-03-05,2,"VERY unfriendly staff at every turn, wrong price, hair in bathroom..long","GENERAL - I made this reservation because of the look of the hotel - kind of old world classy picture - and the location to where my sister lived.  THE ONLY nice person I encountered was the woman who initially made the reservation.  From the time I got there to the minute I checked out it was NOT A GOOD STAY.  Because I was there for a family issue, I had to extend my stay and because I was working and beng there I stayed two days longer because it was easier than rerouting my work for the two days.  I WOULD NOT STAY AGAIN EMERGENT OR NOT.  

When I made the reservation I was given one price, but it was almost 200.00 more when I checked in.  I should have KNOWN something was wrong when I came to see about checking in.  I have traveled quite a bit over the last frew years and NEVER EVER been told I would have a $35.00 early check in fee.  I have always been told no room not yet available or yes we have one available.  The woman at the front desk was cold and never greeted me or the other people...I stood there and finally said, excuse me???  I had to ask where to park and had to reiterate that I was checking in but not checking in since I was paying more per night here than I normally would.  I shop for good deals, BUT the pictures here were so nice I really wanted to stay.  Coming back later that night, the man who checked me in was ALSO UNFRIENDLY, no greeting, nothing.  so totally business like I felt like I was disturbing his quiet time.   I

The room was very large.  BIG DISAPPOINTMENT....one of the reasons I rented this and paid the rate was because I was coming from 50+ inches of snow in Illinios and I wanted to be able to sleep with the balcony open and feel the air.  BUT when I opened the door, stepped out on the balcony I was so disappointed.  There is no secure balcony.  They run in a row, with nothing keeping someone from coming from any other room into your room.  There is a little ""picket fence"" type barrier between the balconies...that is all and it is just above knee-high.  I COULD CLIMB THIS at my age...so no sleeping with the door open.

ROOM AND CLEANLINESS - I unpack my clothes and there are long hairs in my drawer.  I then go to put my toiletries in the bathroom and there are at least 5 hairs there..not mine...I have VERY short hair, but these were at least 7 inches long and dark...my hair is red.  I go to shower and there is long hair on my towels.  That confused me more than realizing they do not have their maids pull their hair back or use hair nets.  BUT the hair on the towel was explained when I left the hotel the next morning.  A maid was walking down the hall with a stack of folded towels on her head...ON HER HEAD...and she had long black hair that was not pulled back...hair on towels.  

The beds seem to be on springs literally and the flooring is not carpeted so the beds move when you climb in and out and sping up and down.  The pillows are HORRIBLE.  Four of the tiny little pillows but not of different firmness..these were all so flat you needed two to make a regular pillow.

THE TOILET IS FOR A 2-YEAR-OLD  - if it was any lower you would squat and pee in a hole in the floor.  I am not abnormally tall, 5'6"" and it was the most uncomfortable experience, i.e. practically sitting on the floor to go to the bathroom.  The bathroom needed work.  The grout was dirty and old looking, but I did not feel there is was mold, just needed to be fixed.  The towels were great, i.e. I don't care if the towel is big and fluffy, if it doesn't absorb when you dry off who cares....these were very absorbent...shower head was nice and could shampoon and rinse hair easily because it actually had good pressure.

It is gated parking and you get a ticket to come in and then present a ticke going out so your car is very safe.

BREAKFAST - They have free breakfast with the room.  THE NICEST PEOPLE I ENCOUNTERED were the service staff, i.e. the grounds keeper said good morning every day, the lady and man making the omelette/scramble was nice and friendly.  too bad the desk staff didnt take lessons from them.  They had a nice setup with the omelette or scramble and I enjoyed the different tea they had, as well as the flavored water.  

INTERNET - The internet ran slow and/or kicked me out several times.  I normally have no issue working from hotels with WIFI but this was hard and being there on family matters and trying to work, very stressful when work that should have taken me only an hour was going into two and more.

HOUSEKEEPING -  SO WRONG.  Because I work on my trips I do not have maid service.  If I really need towels I find housekeeping before I leave for the day and give them the used and get new.  I do not have housekeeping in the room because at one hotel someone decided to check out or do something with my computer and my work load was messed with.  I ended up at Best Buy with GEEK to get things back.  SO I do not have people in my room with my work stuff when I am not there.  TO DATE and after staying at roughly 30+ hotels, this has never been an issue...less work for them and saves the environment.  I would have thought California would be a big conserve resource state but not this hotel.  There is no sign asking you to not get new towels daily or have your bedding changed daily like I have had in most hotels.  So I put the sigh up, leave to go to hospital come back and my room has been cleaned, my things moved.  I let it slide, it was late I was drained.  The next morning, I have the no maid sign in the door and I am sleeping when this maid is trying to get in my room.  I open the door and ask what part of no maid do they not get AND I had told them the day before when I got towels (and they cleaned my room anyway) that I would not need housekeeping during my stay.  She told me they enter and clean rooms anyway, sign or not.  I called the front desk and was informed that the sign only keeps them out of my room till noon, but from noon on they can come in and clean my room.  THIS WAS BEFORE NOON.  I told them they are not giving me the room, I am renting it and I do not want them in my room during my stay.  She told me that was there policy and I asked WHERE that was in writing for me to see because I certainly was not informed of this practice and I see NOTHING ON LINE or in the room stating this policy.  I reiterated that I do not want housekeeping in my room.  If I want bedding changed, I will ask and be there while they are in the room.  This was unacceptable that they feel they had the right to come in my room with a sign on the door.

CHECKOUT - Again, the front desk staff is ridiculously cold and unfriendly.  From check in till check out.  I went down to check out and print boarding pass.  FOUR PEOPLE at that desk talking with each other and not one greeted me, acknowledged me..nothing.  I had ask about the computer for printing boarding pass.  She points to the computer.  I spend 10 minutes trying to figure out why it is not printing or if it is where it is printing.  No signage stating that you have to SEND THEM YOUR BOARDING PASS VIA EMAIL AND THEY PRINT OUT AT THE DESK.  AND when I asked her if that was the computer for printing boarding pass, she never informed me then either.  The front desk really needs some people skills.  WITH THE EXCEPTION of the day I had to add more days to stay till sister would be able to be home, the woman that helped the trainee with the extension was very very nice and helpful.  BUT I ended up staying for a week and if I did not have to work on this trip I would have checked out after day one.","If you are looking for a balcony room, don&#39;t bother as you can&#39;t leave the door open securely.  The back would be best to face or the side.  I liked room 342, close to elevator, ice machine and stairs.  AND it was quiet enough, but then, I couldnt open the door. I believe they had two extra buildings so possibly those would be a good fit, but did not check them out.",2.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,,,,,34
Matthew F,1,,2014-02-28,SOLO,2014-03-04,1,Bag Stolen By Staff Member,"My stay at the Hollywood Hotel was abysmal. I stayed two nights and at the end put my bags into storage in a ""secure"" storage room at the hotel. When I returned to pick them up they were gone. One of the staff members was so rude and told me ""well tough luck, you signed a contract."" Once the LAPD were called they viewed the security footage and said they saw someone take my bag and vanish. The hotel management subsequently refuse to answer or return any of my calls, emails or letters. Besides the theft I was given a room with cockroaches in it and the hotel staff refused to move me, which is totally unacceptable. The saving grace of the hotel is the kitchen staff, they make a great breakfast and even offered to help me find the person who took my bag. I will never stay at this hotel again.

Ronald M,173,"Hopewell Junction, New York",2014-02-28,FAMILY,2014-02-27,2,There is NO AIR CONDITIONING!!!,"My biggest complaint was that there was no AC.  They explained - One central air system it's set to heat.  If we set it to Air it gets to cold at night and customers complain.  Open your window!  Huh? this room doesn't have a window .. and I wasn't about about to leave the ajoined balcony open all night!  We had to have the maintenance guy bring us a fan!
The hotel looks nothing like the pictures you see adverstised.  What you see is the back of the hotel, in the gated parking lot.  I didn't think it was the same place when we drove up.  You have to pay $22 per night for parking, but there is a guard in the lot all night. 
They did serve a good breakfast each morning and it was included in the price (eggs, omlets, sausage, waffles .. not just cold cereal.
They did clean the room daily, and bring fresh towels .. The location is great, it's near everything in LA, the rooms are large and the price is good.The staff was ok, and my wife felt the comforter was a little dirty (so she didn't use it), and hair wasn't cleaned out of the shower (which we cleaned).  All things we can live with for a short  trip  .. but it's just ok for the price and you can't beat the location.","Rooms toward the back away from the street are quieter.

There's a pharmacy and a few food places nearby, and it's very close to the red line train and bus stops which makes accessing a variety of places like Universal Studios, Santa Monica or downtown very easy (if you're not driving and willing to spend the time, there is a bus on Santa Monica Blvd that drives you straight into SM and takes about 1hr-1.5hrs one way, depending on traffic).

There's a pool as well, with chairs and towels provided if you decide to take a couple of hours off the hectic sightseeing and want to tan and relax instead. A spa and a fitness centre are also available. There is free wifi in the room, which is excellent quality.

If you're hesitating booking this hotel, please don't; just press 'book'.",,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-27,"Dear Guest,

Location is very good. There's not much around the hotel except a Subway and a few other small shops. But the public transportation is both cheap and all around, so no problem getting places. 
Our room was facing the patio and didn't hear much of the traffic on Vermont avenue. Bed was just fine, everything was working, but overall the hotel is worn down. It do has its charm though! 
Breakfast was very good with omelettes by your choice and waffles. Also some bagels and toasted bread.

The custom omelettes and made to order eggs and waffles make this hotel a real bargain.  Its location near the Santa-Monica Metro line ($weekly pass $20) made travel to Hollywood, Universal, and Disneyland (via the Metrolink or Amtrack from Union Station) almost free.  The rooms are a good size and the beds very comfortable.  There is not much in the immediate neighborhood, (there is a Rite Aid and mini-mall nearby) but with the transit so convenient, I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wishes to leave their car at home.

This trip we decided to take a chance on another hotel a bit further from the central Hollywood area. The hotel is delightful and very secure. The room was smaller than we are used to and the lack of a real closet was deterring at first. However, the balcony overlooking the patio was a plus. The hotel itself is very clean throughout with a responsive staff. The breakfasts were fantastic and made to order by very friendly cooks. The breakfast, ample secure parking, and proximity to everything make this a place we will definitely stay at again. After weighing, the parking fees versus breakfast at restaurants made this a win as well. (we pay parking fees at all the hotels we stay at in Los Angeles anyway.) I would give this a five thumbs up shy one for the size of the room and lack of closet making it a solid four. PS this edged out the BLVD by a long shot and is our new go to place in L.A.",I really don&#39;t know if there are larger rooms but this sufficed.,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-30,"Dear Guest,

HBRonice,1,"New Haven, Connecticut",2013-12-31,FAMILY,2014-02-05,3,Nice place - Zero Customer Service,"We stayed at Hollywood Hotel the week of New Years.  We wanted to be centrally located for going to the Rose Parade and seeing the sights of Hollywood.  The location was a great choice.  The  Metro was less than 2 blocks away and subway travel was comfortable and easy.  The hotel was deceiving because you do not see the beautiful entrance on your arrival.  The picture is taken of the rear entrance from the parking lot - it really is pretty just not visible from the road.  The lobby was attractive and inviting, the courtyard was lovely, the breakfast room was beautiful and the food good.  The guestroom had a few minor problems, loose/dangerous outlets, weak wifi, chipped sink, fridge wasn't emptied from previous guests, but overall it was clean and decent sized.  They were in the process of updating rooms on our floor.

Unfortunately, customer service was extremely lacking.  We called the night before to find out about a shuttle from the airport and were told, rather rudely, that they don't have shuttles from the airport, only to the airport.  We found out after our stay, we could have made arrangements for a shuttle on the website if the girl had told us this.  We also asked about possibly checking in early and we were told that if the room was ready, that wouldn't be a problem.  When we arrived at 2pm (check-in time is 3pm), we were told (EXTREMELY RUDELY) that our room was ready and that there would be a $30 CHARGE to get in before 3pm!  Why is there a charge if the room is ready?  We left and came back - I would not pay to get into a room that was sitting ready for me.  BEWARE - they have a ""green"" policy so you do not get a written receipt at check-in or check-out.  While this is a great program, they failed to tell us that our receipt would be on the in-room television so we didn't know to look.  We also were not asked for our e-mail address so we never received a statement of any kind.  BIG MISTAKE! When checking our credit card, we had been charged for extra guests in the room!!  When we contacted the hotel manager about this, it took him 4 days to send us a ""folio"" and my signature from check-in had been imported from the tablet onto the folio indicating an additional charge of $207.90 for extra guests (we had a room for 4 - that was set-up for 4 - and we had 4 people in the room).  You will be charged $30/person/night for more than 2 guests in a room for 4!!!   The manager turned out to be the owner and he has still not taken care of this situation.  

I have since read a review from a guest who stayed in Oct. 2013 who was also charged $207.90 for 2 extra guests (he found out at check-in and didn't pay it).  He had a room for 4 and 4 people stayed there as well. 

This hotel charges for EVERYTHING - $30/night for a rollaway bed (although we were told at the desk it was $50), $10/night for extra towels, $65 shuttle to the airport, etc.  Also, don't know if/when the restaurant might reopen but be aware that although the website and the travel sites all list a restaurant on premises, there was no restaurant in January, 2014 (just the breakfast room).

I travel for business 4 or 5 times per year and have never incurred expenses or rude staff like those of Hollywood Hotel.  It's a shame because it really is a nice place and in a good location.",Rooms on the second floor were being renovated - ours wasn&#39;t done yet.

ElizabethDawn,15,"Halifax, Canada",2014-01-31,FRIENDS,2014-01-27,4,"Great Stay, Great Staff","My friend and I travelled to LA from Jan. 18-23 for a girl's getaway.  Neither of us had visited California before. 
We landed at around 4:30pm, picked up our rental car at the airport, and took off to find the hotel.  It's about a 30 minute drive from LAX (depending on traffic) and we found it with no issues.  
At first, we were a little nervous of the location, but we quickly learned that it's really not a bad area.  All of LA is pretty dingy and dirty-ish, so I think we just needed to get used to the big city. We walked as much as possible, and even went 8 blocks on-foot at night to Palermo's Italian restaurant in Los Feliz (amazing food, by the way). Yes there are some homeless people around, but they seemed to be harmless and we were not hassled by anyone.  We were totally comfortable leaving the hotel any time of the day or night. 
The room was ok (#226)...  A little outdated with the floral wallpaper border, but it was very clean and the bed was super comfy. Nothing fancy, but it suited us just fine. Loved the balcony, as well as the fridge/ microwave in-room.  My favorite part of the hotel was the staff -- they were awesome!  Our first encounter was at check-in with Michael and he was great!  Recommended some restaurants, where to find liqour stores, advised about different sightseeing tours, etc.  Really good first impression. 
My luggage didn't make it to LA with us and was coming in on a later flight.  Michael assured me that once it was delivered overnight, they would put my suitcase in the back office until we woke up in the morning.  At 7am I called the front desk, and the lady was lovely -- I went down, got my bag, and off I went -- happy camper.  No issues whatsoever. Also loved the man working at the gift shop -- he was so friendly and helpful and we enjoyed chatting with him :)
Love, love, loved the breakfasts here each morning!  Cooks were all super friendly and the eggs were delicious. Try to go either early or later in the mornings, as it tends to get backed up at peak times. 
Pool area was cute and clean, although we didn't do any swimming, since it was a bit chilly.
Hotel location is close to everything.  We had Justin Timberlake tickets at the Forum in Inglewood and it was really easy to get there. Hotel is five minutes from the Griffith Observatory (amazing views), less than 10 min to Hollywood Blvd and Sunset, and about 30-40 min drive to Malibu & Santa Monica.  Great base for exploring the city. Parking is $22/ day, but well worth it in my opinion.
Overall I would give this hotel a 4 star rating -- it was a great value.  Rooms are nothing special, but the friendliness of the staff and cleanliness of the facilties really made it stand out in my mind.  Would definitely return and recommend to anyone travelling to LA!",,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-30,"Dear Guest,

My wife and I stayed there while visiting my son at USC (less than 10 minutes away.) While our room was recently remodeled to a modern motif, the decor was most amenable and the bed was super comfortable (we had stayed there before so were able to see the upgrades.) It was nicer than the 4 star we recently experienced in Paris. Obviously I wasn't the only one who felt this way. Many guests I ran into were from various parts of Europe. I wasn't surprised as the Hollywood Hotel is freeway close (101,) 10-20 minutes from many Hollywood and LA attractions including the Hollywood Bowl, Greek, LA Colosseum, Staples Center and tons of fantastic restaurants. The free WiFi was recently upgraded, (I got host IP addresses from 2 carriers.) Had no problem watching NFL.com or Netflix.  There was also a secluded pool and a really nice and quiet, interior/outdoor patio lounge you could hang and have a glass of wine. And the best was HD quality TV, as good or better than home!

mel818,1,"Durham, North Carolina",2014-01-31,SOLO,2014-01-20,4,Perfect Gem in LA,"I read wonderful reviews of this hotel prior to my stay.  It lived up to my expectations.

The room was fantastic.  Clean and crisp.  It had a mini-fridge and mircrowave.  It overlooked an enclosed garden.  The fitness center was perfect.  It had a treadmill and elliptical machine that actually worked.  Plus free weights.  I didn't try the pool (much too cold).  But it looked quite lovely.  

The complimentary breakfast was AMAZING.  Oralia (one of the chefs) made me delicious egg white omelets in the morning.  Actually, she made everyone their eggs and waffles in the morning.  The hotel could add one more front of house chef to help alleviate guest backup in the morning.  

One thing I didn't find out until I got there was that off-street parking is an additional $22/night.  The hotel does arrange car rentals if the need be.  However, the metro is quite close.  Fantastic restaurants are within walking distance too. 

A weird thing, for Wifi, depending on where you are in the hotel, you may have to re-establish your connection.  I would have to reconnect my phone when I was in my room and when I was downstairs for breakfast.    

Also, Vermont Street (the street the hotel is on) leads straight into Griffith Park and past the Greek Theater.  Wind your way up to Griffith Park observatory.  It is a fantastic way to catch sunset.  

It is charming hotel and evokes the romantic spirit of early Hollywood.  It is a great price point for all that you get.  Stay here!",,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-30,"Dear Guest,

The front desk staff were very friendly and accommodating.

Our room was large and clean, and the beds were comfortable. The bathroom was a little on the small side, but this was no big deal. We had a balcony facing out to a quiet street. It would have been nice if there was a couple of seats on the balcony.

The included breakfast is great with a good choice of cereals, breads and pastries and juices and coffee/tea. Or if you are not in a hurry you can line up for freshly cooked Omelets with fillings of choice, plus delicious fluffy waffles. 

The location of the Hotel is not close to Hollywood Blvd by walking, however there is a Subway station very close by (3 min walk), and the Subway was very easy to catch. There is also a Bus stop out front of the Subway station were you can catch a Bus to Santa Monica for $1.50.

spm23,109,,2013-12-31,FAMILY,2014-01-02,4,Excellent Location,"Mixed reactions to this hotel. Overall, it is very good for its price, breakfast and location. However, some of the staff do not come across as the friendliest (reception) and accomodating. 
First impressions count and the arrival was not the most welcoming and I think our views with the receptionist ended up with us getting a room next to the lobby which is not the quietest one every night. This room should be avoided at all costs (Room 137)

That said, you cannot fault its location close to the hollywood blvd and sunset strip. It is close to the freeway if driving to access Universal, Santa Monica or indeed back to Aneheim and we did all of that with ease and no traffic problems.

Breakfast is as all other reviews, excellent with something on the menu for everyone and the staff cooking could not be more opposite to reception with a smile and taking time to talk to the guests and asking them how they were and how was the stay in LA and how did they find the hotel. They need to give lessons upstairs.

Rooms were clean, nothing special, not the best, not the worst but for the rates being paid, I think more than worth the money.

Plenty of fast food places to eat in surrounding areas and whilst a few homeless around, all was pretty safe to walk.
Close to bus and metro for those without car.

Parking is $22 per day but again, when added to the cost of the hotel, still pretty good value overall.","Avoid Room 137 close to reception, noisy",5.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-30,"Dear Guest,

After good reviews on TA & the good price I recommended them to book this hotel. Of course the name also played a role,... if you are in Hollywood ... stay in Hollywood Hotel :D 

the property seemed bit old especially the elevator was like thousand year old. The rooms were clean and well equipped and pretty big. 

Checking process wasn't very comfortable, we were denied free parking, which was promised from the hotel booking site. And also the extra bed for one friend, which was sorted out after showing the voucher. 

Wasn't very happy with the staff's behavior.

Bed was comfortable, there was coffee maker, iron, refrigerator, hair drier etc. were in room. For the price it seemed pretty good to me. Breakfast was good... loved the omelette.

They also have off street parking for $22, which in LA can be $40+. we roll with a van full of equipment so that amenity was extremely helpful to us.

tmgmdny,37,"New York City, New York",2013-11-30,FRIENDS,2013-12-12,3,They Are Trying,"I booked this hotel because it was close to my friend's apartment and because I got a terrific rate. I always look for a couple of things when I am traveling: This had free wi-fi (sometimes maddeningly slow), a free hot breakfast, and the parking was only $22 a night (in LA it usually goes as high as $40). It also has a pool, which looked nice but the weather was too cold to use. The hotel is walking distance to a strip mall which had a drug store and a nice yogurt place (also a Staples). You can also walk to some fast food type restaurants. Checking in seemed to take forever, and I can't figure out why.
Now, let's get to the specifics. The room was a box of decent size with no artwork of anything on the walls. A dresser, double bed, desk, chair, end tables, refrigerator, microwave oven and a clothing rack on the wall. The bed was very comfortable and there were 4 nice pillows. Bathroom has a tub with shower and a huge mirror. Unfortunately, there was also one behind the door which means you looked at yourself whenever you were on the toilet and had the door closed. This room overlooked the courtyard and had a balcony. It was nice sitting on the balcony looking out - the lights out there at night are lovely. For the most part, the room was quiet, though you could hear people in the hallway. The room was worn. It did not seem dirty, but could probably use an industrial cleaning and some paint touch up's. I couldn't tell if the hotel was sprucing itself up or had spruced and was now coming down from it. My friend said, ""I think they're trying, but they haven't gotten there yet."" All the interest is in the back entrance through the parking lot. The room was bland, the hallways are bland. The breakfast is great. Yes, you can get an omlette. There are two stations and the line was always at least 10 people long - it takes a while. You can avail yourself of the sausage links, though, and the plate of meats and cheeses. The mini bagels I had were fresh and the coffee was good. The fresh fruit looked fresh and there were a good 1/2 dozen types of cereal. Eat as much as you like! 
I would not recommend this hotel but if I had similar circumstances, I would stay here again - as long as I got a rate like I had this time.",,5.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-04-30,"Dear Guest,

Robert L,1,"Cambridge, Massachusetts",2013-11-30,FAMILY,2013-11-23,4,Breakfast a highlight,"Hollywood Hotel is a solid, modestly-priced option for a trip to LA. 

It's located a mile or so from the heart of Hollywood, so be ready to drive or take public transit to get to the major tourist spots. 

The rooms are spacious and clean, and there are a number of cool, funky restaurants nearby. The Vegan place at the corner of Vermont and Fountain (two blocks from the hotel) is excellent. 

A highlight of the hotel is its breakfast: made to order omelettes/eggs and waffles, with sausage and yogurt, plus a nice selection of pastry and cereals. 

Sonia and Oralia were cooking my first morning of my stay, and their warmth and friendliness made me feel very welcome. 

One small request: it would be great if they could include half-and-half to add to the morning coffee (instead of sweetened Coffee Mate).",,,,,,,,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-30,"Dear Guest,

The hotel went out of it way to arrange to open up specially for us the bar area on the Sunday night so that we could have a few hours with our relatives.  Cecile and all the staff were very friendly and answered our any queries we had, which coming from another country is invaluable.

The breakfast at the restaurant in the Hotel and the service was excellent especially the chef Sonia. On Thursday Sonia cooked my Omelette which resulted very tasty and wonderful. She offered me waffles and sausages Sonia was very nice and friendly overall the food here is delicious huge menu.
The only negative thing was that the pool towels need to be replace by new ones. They look like their dirty and old please change them for new ones.

Oliver A,1,"London, United Kingdom",2013-09-30,FRIENDS,2013-11-20,5,Amazing,"I stayed here for four days before and three days after my ""Groove Cruise LA"". Hotel was clean and tidy and welcoming. Location is good. For English people it is within walking distance to the closest metro and some bars and restaurants further north on N. Vermont Ave. However as previous reviews say you do need a car when visiting LA. I did find the parking to be a little expensive but room rates were lower than other hotels, Breakfast was epic there was so much choice. I did become a fan of the early morning 8am bowl of granola and come back before 10 for some eggs/omelette or waffles. Our first room which was situated on the ground floor room was amazing shower was huge TV good picture and a good selection of channels. There was free Wi-Fi but was spread over 5/6 different hubs so you had to constantly change Wi-Fi to get the better/stronger signal air con was good but a little noisy. I used the laundry room twice while I was there buy your requirements from the small shop near the gym as I found out that the dispensers are a rip off and can often take your money. They gym has sufficient equipment and pool was never busy and was large enough and deep enough. What really made my trip was the hotel staff. Gisel on the front desk (gorgeous woman with long brown hair) was so helpful no mater how strange our request was she didn't judge and was happy to help. Upon our return from our cruise we were a little worse for wear after 72hours of non stop EDM. She was able to get our rooms ready early and even waived the early check in charge. It also helped that she was smoking hot!!!! If I ever went to LA and didn't stay here I would still go in to thank her for everything she did to make my vacation as amazing as it was.",,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-27,"Dear Guest,

Albert Harris,25,"Orlando, Florida",2013-11-30,SOLO,2013-11-18,3,Decent place to stay,"I stayed here for one night on nov 17th after finishing up a week cruise.  This hotel was a last minute choice and it was an ok choice.  

The location was easy to find and once I got into the lobby my reservation wasn't ready yet so they told me to park my car in the back. Once I parked my car I sat in the lobby til my reservation was ready (I had booked it from priceline an hour before). 

There sitting I watched interesting guests blaming the hotel for their personal own shortcomings such as cell phone service and providing slippers.  My own opinion about the staff is decent but they will not put up with crazy requests.  

I checked in a couple minutes later and went up to my room.  The room was decent with a queen size bed and a nice bathroom.  The decor was movie like and the tv was a smart LCD HDTV.  However the hotel has AC but does not have a central heater.  So they provide a space heater to compensate for the cold temperature.  I was glad they had that at least.  

Laundry is coin operated and the hotel does have a continental breakfast and a small gift shop.  However the neighborhood nearby was shady but parking is fenced with a attendant posted at the gate entrance which made me a little bit comfortable despite the LAPD helicopters looking for somebody.

Keep in mind you do have to pay 22 a day for parking (includes taxes). 

Overall it is a decent hotel to stay.  Not too special but if you're on a budget this is decent.  ",,,,,,,,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-04-30,"Dear Guest,

matthewjfarrar,119,"Leeds, United Kingdom",2013-06-30,COUPLES,2013-11-18,4,Did everything we needed it to do at a good price,"We booked and paid well in advance for four nights on Expedia.  As the stay approached I wanted to cancel based on the reviews but couldn't as we had prepaid.

However I had nothing to worry about as the hotel did absolutely everything that we needed it to do.  Parking is expensive so I parked on the street on Vermont Place (right next to the hotel) where parking was free from 20:00 to 08:00.  We were out all day so this did not cause us a problem.  On a mornign I went and put one hours parking on the car before we had breakfast which cost very little.  Parking was free all day Sunday.  One day had overnight street cleaning so watch out for this.  Pull onto the ramp to load/unload baggage then park up.

Our room was a little tired but a decent size and comforatbel with air con, a fridge and a balcony.  Buffet breakfast was nice, a little frantic at the weekend but with nice bread, yoghurt etc set us up well for the day.  

Easy access to metro - you can get all the way to Universal without changing lines etc.  Plently of places to eat nearby.  Good central location but like everywhere in LA you normally need to drive.

Hotel staff friendly with free wifi available.  Nothing that I could find that was negative based on our stay and the reasonable price.",,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-30,"Dear Guest,

kari,155,"Vancouver, Canada",2013-11-30,BUSINESS,2013-11-12,2,Disappointing.,"I read a number of reviews about the Hollywood Hotel prior to my arrival and the number one complaint was the noise from the road (Vermont.) I emailed the hotel and requested a room away from the road. Upon my arrival I checked in – walked up to my room (very, very small room) and as I was opening the door I could hear the traffic and sirens. I went in, called the front desk asked if it was possible to switch rooms. They told me that was the only room available.  

I had been up since 4:00 a.m. that morning and wanted to get a quick nap in prior to meeting with my colleagues for dinner – that wasn’t happening. As if the traffic and sirens weren’t enough the construction coming from across the hall made me feel like I was in the middle of a construction site.

After my unsuccessful nap I decided to have a shower and try to get refreshed. When I walked in the bathroom I was disgusted by what was on the floor. (I still don’t want to think of exactly what it was.) I called the front desk and was once again told there were no other rooms and I could try calling down in the morning to see if anything had come available. 

That night I hardly slept, the street is extremely busy (with sirens, buses, loud cars – and low flying helicopters at times.) If you do stay in the hotel with your room facing the street bring earplugs.

The next morning I did call down again and was moved to a courtyard facing room. Noise level was much, much better – but the stain on the duvet when I first walked in the room wasn’t that appealing, nor was the smell. 

I tried to air out the room and it helped a little, but not much. Thankfully the temperature allowed me to be sans duvet for the next 3 nights. 

That evening I went to the gym to get in a good workout. I have to say it is the first gym that I have ever been in that didn’t have a spray bottle, or wipes, for the equipment. There was a hand sanitizer dispenser, but not surprisingly it was bone dry. I did mention it to a woman at the front desk, but when I went back the following afternoon it was still empty.

When I got switched into the new room I did put the red “no not enter” sign on my door – and the first morning it was obeyed – the next morning I had organized stuff on the sheet on the bed, made sure the sign was still on the handle when I left and when I came back it was all mixed up and placed on the dresser….as was the sign from the door handle.

The hotel does offer complement breakfast – the woman serving omelettes and waffles was very, very sweet, as well as free Wi-Fi. 

I doubt I’ll be back – but you may have better luck?",Avoid rooms facing Vermont,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,,,,,116

Veronika78,66,"London, United Kingdom",2013-10-31,COUPLES,2013-11-08,4,Surprisingly Good Accommodation,"My husband and I stayed here in October 2013 for 4 nights. This hotel was recommended by my sister, who stayed 2 years previously. We wanted a nice clean hotel, especially as LA hotels are generally quite expensive. This hotel surprised us. It was bigger than expected and clean (stairwell was ok but we mostly used the elevators). The room was a good size with good toiletries (including shower cap and mouth wash), tea/coffee, fridge, microwave and free buffet breakfast, which was very good. Fresh omelettes, waffles, eggs, sausages (very yummy), pastries, fruit and cereal were all part of the choices to be had. We were impressed. And Elvira (the chef) was very friendly. Most hotels give small tea cups for breakfast so it was nice to have a proper sized mug for my tea for a change!

Car rentals can be arranged at the hotel too. There was a nice big car park onsite for about $20 a day, which was worth it as it was a safe gated car park. The hotel has a small gym, sauna and gift shop too - we bought a few bits so came in handy.

There is a bar opposite the breakfast room and free Wi-Fi in rooms. Rooms had a small balcony but no chairs. The only minuses were the bed (not perfectly comfortable) and not having a safe in the room. The cleaners were very good and the room was cleaned well each day. 

The location was good for getting around (although not the nicest) but you do need a car for any stay in LA. Traffic too is a nightmare. Hotel is close to Griffith park, Universal Studios, walk of fame etc and you can see the Hollywood sign from the stairwell on the third floor. You won't regret your stay here. The price was good as we had free breakfast and only needed dinner since we stayed full most of the day. 

If we visited LA again we would stay here. Hopefully they will have a safe in the rooms!","Some rooms face the garden in middle of the hotel, which we had.

Tyler M,1,,2013-11-30,BUSINESS,2013-11-07,3,First time in Hollywood,"I typically stay at four to five star hotels primarily Hilton's etc. However my assistant made a mistake and I ended up at Hollywood Hotel. I have to be honest I was a little disappointed at first due to my assistants error however upon entry to the hotel I was greeted by the friendliest staff I have ever meet! It did not stop at check in. The service was incredible throughout my entire stay. Two people stood out to me in particular. The first being Hugo. Hugo greeted my at the elevator my first day having breakfast. After taking my order we spoke for a great deal of time in detail about my trip to Los Angeles. The personal service Hugo provides is second to none! Not even the many Hilton hotels I typically stay at have staff members as friendly or as helpful as Hugo was to me. Hugo's attention to detail was incredible. Every day I asked for a yogurt at breakfast and every day he wiped the water off of the container and handed it to me. A friendly wave in the parking lot from Hugo made my day Thursday morning on my way into the hotel after a long day of meetings in Beverly Hills. I truly hope Hugo's manager recognizes they have a true gem in this staff member. Great job Hugo!! 

The second staff member that struck my attention is Elvira, Elvira is so friendly and always has a smile on her face. The language barrier does not stop Elvira from ensuring I am taking care of 100% of the time! Not only did she ensure I ate a full breakfast she also asked if everything was OK in my room on a consistent basis.

Mostly I just sleep in a hotel and don't spent any time there. That being said, my room, which was ""under construction"" (smelly primer on one wall; holes everywhere) and having old blood stains on my blanket was so cold, and they couldn't change that, that they gave me 2 more blankets - which I was totally fine with by the way - I slept safe and sound!
All amenities in the room, besides the air-conditioning, worked perfectly fine.

Best part: the staff is extremely nice and helpful, front desk as well as anyone else. On top of it, the breakfast is well prepared and the friendly staff downstairs (in the restaurant) made me smile every morning. Thanks Hugo and Juan and lovely waffle-cooker ladies !

Free wi-fi is also a plus, though I was prompted every time I opened my phone/ laptop to enter the pw... a little annoying, but hey, it's included in the price.

The hotel is close to the metro and all kinds of buses (direct line 704 to Santa Monica!). If you want good food and are looking for some minor vintage artsy shopping: just walk up Vermont for about 15 minutes, there are fantastic restaurants/bistros and lovely little stores.

I think I must have been unlucky with my room, which gave me the feel of being in a motel rather than a hotel. I'm sure the other rooms are quite nice.

Housekeeping did a great job of cleaning to rooms and we left our ipods in the room and they were neatly put away when we returned.

The reason why I have scored this hotel only three stars is down to not having anything in the area to do in the evenings, we did go down to the bar one evening but it was very expensive and not welcoming. They had an open mic comedy show on and the jokes were very inappropriate. I am not a prude and do not get easily offended but this guy really was too much.

Also the rooms were a little tired, we decided to unplug our fridge one night as it was making so much noise and we had nothing in there. When we pulled the plug out there were sparks and the socket almost came off the wall. Lastly the lock you can put on the door when you are in your room was broken.

Overall it was a good stay and if I ever visited LA again I would consider this hotel.",Our room over looked the Courtyard which meant there wasnt as much noise as the rooms that faced the road.,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-04-30,"Dear Guest,

Gorgota,15,,2013-10-31,SOLO,2013-10-27,4,Self-service Guest Apartment,"Likes:
The room is spacious and well-presented. Complimentary breakfast includes freshly made omelette and waffles. Convenient to order take-out to your hotel room and laundry only costs $5. Although the hotel does not provide adapter, you can get one at the gift shop that only costs $2.50. Surprisingly the shampoo and conditioner are of very good quality. Other amenities are also good, including beautifully folded towels, pillows. Free Wi-Fi. 

Dislikes:
The corridor is quite dark, the room is dimly lit. Second floor looks shabby and I had to request to have the room changed to first floor. There is no security safe in the room. There is a connecting door to another room, which does not seem to be secured. Floor is not carpeted, so it's cold and there are no slippers provided. It is located in a poorly neighbourhood. I was under the wrong impression that the hotel was within walking distance to Chinese Theatre. If you rent a car or have the tour picked you up from the hotel, it shouldn't be a worry. No decent shops or restaurants nearby. Sufficient but don't expect a service like in a hotel. My neighbour was very loud in the middle of the night and I could hear their music.

There is a good Japanese fast food nearby.",First floor,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-30,"Dear Guest,

It is beautifully and well appointed in all aspects of the hotel. The traditions of second to none service has been maintained to the present time.The staff are extremely friendly, professional, attentive and skilled in every aspect of service to our stay. There is no word to describe the high level of cleanliness of the entire hotel. Luxurious comfort should say it all. My favourite area was the courtyard  but the morning cafe was a perfect way to start a great day; fabulous food presentation and preparation, cheerful service and a pleasing environment. 

 Access to get to downtown Hollywood is quite easy but it comes with the requirement to be trusting; the subway access station is a two minute walk from the hotel. It is architecturally appealing, clean and safe no matter what hour of travel. An 8 minute ride costing only $1.50 (or $20.00/week unlimited) will take to the heart of all the Hollywood action!

Immediate area is somewhat run-down (with some homeless people) but quickly changes heading north to a very nice area, with lots of nice restaurants and trees.  Hiking in Griffith Park is excellent.  Try Starfish Sushi for excellent Japanese food and Electric Lotus for excellent Indian cuisine (both just north of Hollywood Blvd).

The rooms were cleaned daily, you're given the (free) wifi information upon check-in, and there is a free breakfast that runs from 6:30am to 10:30am with eggs cooked how you'd like them, cereals, bread for toasting, muffins, fruit. yoghurts, coffee, tea, and juices. The rooms have easy to use air-con in them and extremely comfortable beds, along with a bathroom with a great shower in it, a television, refrigerator, and plenty of drawers for storing clothes. 
It's around a 30 minute walk to Hollywood Boulevard, there are bus stops and metro train stations nearby, and plenty of small stores and restaurants not far from it. 
The staff were absolutely wonderful, two who stood out to us the most were Hugo and Oralia, they made us more than happy every morning and being so far away from home this made us even more comfortable with our stay. 
There was a morning when one girl who was staying in the hotel was extremely rude to a certain member of staff during breakfast, constantly complaining, being wasteful of her food, and holding everybody up. The staff member kept their cool and another took over. I really eel that people need to realise that they're getting a free meal to start their day and they can choose from a wide variety, there really should be no complaints about this sort of thing. 
The gentleman who runs the shop was also very helpful, as was the man who checked us in, unfortunately I didn't manage to get their names as we were leaving at a time they weren't there.  
When we were waiting on our taxi to take us to the airport, two women came in and asked for a room but didn't know how long they'd be staying. Unfortunately the hotel only had one room available as they were fully booked, but the women didn't want the one offered to them. The lady at reception was kind enough to point them in the direction of two hotels nearby which was lovely! I've been in a situation before where hotel staff at other hotels haven't been nearly as helpful, so this has made me even more confident with using the Hollywood Hotel in the future. 
All in all it was a wonderful trip. The buses and rails nearby were very easy to use, the location was fine, even at night time, everybody we encountered was extremely helpful, and if we come back to Los Angeles we will certainly stay here!","We didn&#39;t choose our room, but instead were given a ground floor one on the inside with a balcony onto the courtyard.

When we arrived the rooms were jaded but clean however after a long drive we asked if the bar/restaurant were open? We were told they were not as the bar manager was on vacation!! When I expressed our disappointment and how this was an inconvenience as my father who was with us was disabled so this was why we chose the hotel, we were informed they were only informed themselves via email and there was nothing they could do about it. When I asked to speak to the manager was told he was not in there was no one senior available and even if they rang him he would not answer his phone as he never did! I was annoyed that none of this was mentioned when I made the booking only the day before and they must have known!
Upon realising there was no one willing/able to help us as we would have to find an alternative as we were planning to be there for nearly a week we decided to have a walk to find somewhere to eat/drink, the area was less than desirable and a little rough with nothing within 20 mins walk.

The room was great. Nice comfy bed to sleep off the jet lag! Plenty of room to kick back as well.
Another plus is the breakfast in the mornings! More than enough options to fuel the body for a day of sight seeing. Loved it! 
We enjoyed our time here and if we are in LA again we will with out a doubt be staying at the Hollywood hotel! ",,,,,,,,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-27,"Dear Guest,

The cold bar was fit itself. Breads of every variety including muffins and pastries. Cereal variety was lovely as well. My favorite was seen Sonia and Hector in the morning.

Kay O,20,"Shanklin, United Kingdom",2013-10-31,FRIENDS,2013-10-12,5,Wish I could have stayed longer,"Stayed at this hotel for three nights with a friend for a very special trip to LA to see a play at Atwater Village Theatre.  I chose the Hollywood because of its proximity to the main tourist sites in LA and the good value for money offered.  I was not disappointed.  

We were travelling on a reasonably tight budget and used public transport a lot. The hotel is very well placed for this. On arrival we got the Flyaway bus from LAX to Union Station - it takes about 40 minutes and costs $7. From Union Station you can either take a short taxi ride or it's just a few stops on the subway Red Line.  The hotel is easy walking distance from Vermont/Santa Monica station. Public transport is excellent value in LA - $5 a day for unlimited travel on the buses and subway trains.

The hotel itself has a very European feel. Tiled floors and a lovely relaxing courtyard with comfy outdoor seating, plants and a fountain.  Our room was on the ground floor with an outdoor aspect to a side road. You could hear some traffic noise, but this was not intrusive. The room had sliding doors onto a patio area and very efficient blackout curtains for night time.  Towels were changed every day, although personally I would like to see an eco policy in place where you request a towel change only if needed. The room had a coffee maker and microwave, clock/radio, hairdryer, complimentary toiletries and tissues. The free Wifi is efficient and works throughout the hotel and the outdoor courtyard. We did not have time to use the outdoor swimming pool during our stay so I can't say if the Wifi works there, but the swimming pool area was quiet and well maintained in a secure enclosure with a pleasant atmosphere. The hotel also has a small shop for souvenirs and essentials.

Breakfast was included in our room rate and this was excellent. Custom made omelettes or scrambled eggs, waffles, sausages, cereal, pastries, fruit, toast, tea, coffee and a selection of juices. Something for everyone. Breakfast is also served until the very civilised hour of 10:30am! The dining area has a really nice atmosphere too.

The reception staff were very helpful with local information and bus routes. They ordered taxis for us as required. Checkout time is 11am and you can leave your bags in a secure room afterwards if required. 

This hotel is ideally placed for visiting Paramount Studios, Hollywood Walk of Fame, Rodeo Drive and Beverly Hills. Santa Monica is a longer bus ride away but drops you off at an intersection 5 minutes walk away.

There is no evening meal service at the hotel but don't let that put you off. There are restaurants and take away places very close by.  All in all I can't wait to go back to LA and to stay at this hotel again - wish this trip could have been longer.",,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-27,"Dear Guest,

Liz P,3,,2013-10-31,FAMILY,2013-10-11,3,Disappointing Customer Service,"We were initially very pleased with this hotel, until the third day of our stay, when we had two separate disappointing customer service experiences.
The first two days we ate at the breakfast buffet, the food and service was excellent. Oralia made our omelets exactly as we ordered them and was very friendly. She had a smile on her face and was pleasant and cheerful to both co-workers and other customers.
The third day of our stay, Oralia was not working and Elvira made our omelets. She used an extremely high heat, causing the entire restaurant to smell like burnt eggs. When my daughter asked her to re-make her burnt omelet, she got upset and argued with us that the brown, burnt part was the bacon. She continued to argue with us about it and asked if we wanted the egg raw, obviously using sarcasm. She complained about us in Spanish to her co-worker, Hugo, believing that we did not understand her. Hugo was kind and professional and encouraged her to just make the omelet again. He also came to our table later and asked if everything was okay. 
The second experience we had of extremely poor customer service was when we went to the front desk at 12:45 p.m. and nicely explained that our room hadn't been cleaned yet and that we needed clean towels in order to shower after using the gym, and arrive at an appointment in time. We had been awake and out of our room since 7 a.m. Giselle at the front desk was on a personal phone call and left me standing there waiting for several minutes. She was also eating while talking on the phone. When she finally asked me if I needed help and I told her about our room not being clean and needing the clean towels, she replied ""Oh yea, they're probably still on their lunch break. They will be done at like 1"". I explained that we needed clean towels and instead of attempting to get them for us she just said again ""Yeah, they will be there soon."" When we returned to our room at 1:30 p.m. it still had not been cleaned and I had to ask a maid on another floor for towels. 
This hotel is a bit overpriced, especially when receiving such poor and unprofessional service.",,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-04-30,"Dear Guest,

MoMo4124,1,,2013-10-31,COUPLES,2013-10-10,5,GREAT Experience!!!,"I love this place...I really really do! Where do I start...okay I'll just list, it's easier!

Hotel Staff - EXCELLECT!! Better than a 5 star hotel...from the made to order chefs Hugo and Sophia, to the clerks and managers (Roman and Nelson) this place really gives the treatment! Hugo and Sophia ensured that our tummies were full and satisfied with their delectable omlettes and waffles! They don't rush your food and the omelettes are fantastic! Nelson and Roman (mgr) assisted with getting my purse that I left in my room, returned to Atlanta with no issue! I truly appreciate the way the staff took care of us!

Parking - Expensive ($20/day) but it is what it is, everywhere in LA cost 15-25 bucks!

Area/Location - Okay, looks deserted at night but pretty safe neighborhood. We saw lots of people walking in from bars and convenient stores. The location is close to EVERYTHING! Hollywood and Vine (nightlife and tourist area) is less then 10 mins away, the Hills 5 minutes, Santa Monica 25 mins, airport 15-20 mins! I advise staying here instead of the LAX airport area if you're a tourist!! 

Rooms - Very small but very clean and comfortable. The space was fine for just me and hubby (Not high maintenance folks...but not motel hoppers either!). The showers are hot with a great water flow! We really weren't in our room much. 

Room Price - Very Reasonable considering the area/location and the amenities of the hotel. I'd happily pay the daily parking fee for free unlimited breakfast every morning! Very good deal!

NatalieLedward,7,"Manchester, United Kingdom",2013-09-30,FRIENDS,2013-10-06,5,We would visit again. And again..,"Well.

I would just like to send a special thank you to all staff at this hotel. Me and my sister (24 and 19) visited from the UK for a weeks stay in September and we were taken aback by how welcoming and friendly everyone was. 

Hugo and Sofia in particular- the breakfast staff do a fantastic job. Who would have thought that one of our fondest memories to come home with after a month of travelling Canada and California would be meeting those two. We ended up having photos with them before we left because Sofia made our day every single morning greeting us and wishing us a great day with a genuine smile. And Hugo. Well. He makes killer omelettes that set us up for each day of jam-packed activities! I can honestly say the breakfast and those omelette were the nicest ive ever had not just at any hotel, but ever! I didn't think I even liked omelettes that much! Hugo was friendly and genuinely interested in how our holiday was going.

We loved everything about our stay including the facilities, rooms, location etc but it's always the people who make or break an experience. And this hotel is hiring the right people.

It wont be long before we are back im sure....",The rooms are basic and small- cleaned every day and plenty enough for me and my sister- we were out every single day really. But they were comfortable enough for a nice night in too watching tv! We went to see the Tonight Show with Jay Leno being taped in Burbank through the day and then watched it back in bed at night! Excellent! We had a queen room with a balcony on the courtyard. If you can ask for that- do because the courtyard is wonderful!

Pippin1960,96,"Scunthorpe, United Kingdom",2013-09-30,COUPLES,2013-10-05,5,A great base in LA,"The Hollywood hotel in LA is in a great position to see all there is in this fantastic place. The rooms were very big and comfortable, well appointed, though they did lack a kettle (A coffee maker is not appropriate for making tea!). All the fixtures and fittings were in great order and I couldn't complain about anything. 

When we first got to the room the fridge did not work, but when we got back after an evening out, it was sorted - big tick there.

The breakfast was nice, with a good choice, though the area was not quite big enough - we never had to wait for a table but a couple of times it was close. The toasters also needed to be replaced - there was always a queue to use the machines which were working.

My only real gripe was being charged a connection fee of $1.09 for the phone even though we were using an AT & T card. This was charged for each call. We used the phones in all other hotels on our trip without this charge! Beware of this.

$22 per night parking was also a bit steep but seems the norm for LA, and we WERE aware of this so that wasn't a surprise.

On the whole though, the hotel was great and I would use again.",,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-27,"Dear Guest,

Ellenfanone,7,"Calgary, Canada",2013-09-30,COUPLES,2013-10-01,2,Too noisy,"This hotel was very clean and the staff were quite helpful.  When we initially checked we asked if they could give us a room that would be quiet, as my wife has trouble sleeping.  Well guess what they gave us a room that was facing a busy road, and all night we heard sirens going off, car alarms being set off by the noisy trucks that went by. The next morning we asked them to change the room but they offered us one that would have been even noisier.  So we suffered for five nights.
The breakfast was excellent every morning and the rooms were cleaned up to par. The location was easily accessible to catch the metro.
I would recommend this hotel if you can sleep through anything.",Choose a room away from the street,3.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,,,,,4
EnglishDragon,815,"Scunthorpe, United Kingdom",2013-09-30,COUPLES,2013-10-01,3,Average hotel in a ok location.,"Just got back from staying 5 nights at the Hotel of Hollywood and while I'm not disappointed with the hotel I have to say its nothing to shout home about.

Location - I thought I'd talk about this first seen as thought its a big talking point on here and in the hotel. The hotel is about a 10 minute drive from the touristy side of Hollywood and I have to disagree with a lot of people about the area being rough, its not a great tourist area so don't expect bars and shops within walking distance but I wouldn't say don't walk the streets. I never felt scared to walk the streets alone but I can see why some people were. Finally YOU NEED A CAR IF YOUR STAYING HERE!!! yes there are metro stops nearby but public transport in LA is  largely useless, if you don't get a car you'll find this hotel to be very isolated.

Room - The rooms are very basic and dated. The wallpaper in our room was starting to lift and there were slight signs of mould in places but you get all the basic amenaties (Iron, Hairdryer, Fridge) and free wifi which is a bonus. If your looking for just a bed and a base in  LA then this is perfect for the price. Also ask for an indoor room, the outside rooms look out on to Vermont Avenue which is a very busy road, light sleepers will find the road very loud even in the middle of the night

Negatives - The breakfast is very basic and by our 4th day we had got completely fed up with it. There are 2 chefs at a egg station that do great scrambled eggs and omelettes but because its not a buffet it gets very backlogged and you find yourself queueing for 10 minutes every morning. My other big gripe is parking, $20 a day to park your car at the hotel your paying to stay at is ridiculous, I've never known a hotel charge that much for parking ever.

Overall its a basic 2/3 star hotel that's perfect as a base camp for LA, if your after anything more than that for your hotel then pay the money to go somewhere else.",Ask for an inside room upstairs.,5.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-04-30,"Dear Guest,

Most staffs were so arrogant and haughty, and they were so impolite. Unluckily, it rained hard in the afternoon of the day we stayed in the hotel. We checked in 10:00p.m. and went to bathroom to wash hands. At that time we realized that the supply of water stopped. I went to the front desk to ask the reason. A staff was so arrogant and said “It is not our fault. It is due to today's rain. If you want to use water, go to another hotel!“     Oh, dear!  Go to another hotel?!  When we checked in, you  had already known the situation, I'm sure. Why you didn't inform it to us?  We couldn't understand.

So I asked him to change to the other rooms. Only he said was NO. I myself and the other family members couldn't believe this. We were eager to move but it was past 11:00p.m. So we put up with. We checked out in the early morning of the next day

I am glad I went with my guts when booking because I was not dissapointed. Rather I was very positively surprised.
The hotel itself is great. The rooms are quite big and the cleaning staff did an excellent job every day.
I really enjoyed the bed - haven't slept this well in a long time!

There is a choice of 4-6 different cereals, there is fruit, pastries, bagels and bread as well as cold cuts, butter, jam, Nutella and Peanut Butter. 
And then you have your coffee, tea and 4 different juices.
The staff at the Front Desk was very polite, courtous and knowledgable. We were always served quickly and received correct information. 
The hotel is amazingly located between two metro stations that take you straight to the Chinese Theater, Walk of Fame and Universal within 10-15 min.
There is also a bus that goes straight to Santa Monica in around 1 hour and the fare is only USD 1.50.
At one of the metro strops there is also the stop for one of the DASH Shuttles that goes straight up to Griffiths Observatory. The Fare for this shuttle is 50 cent!
It is true that there aren't any ""amazing"" restaurants nearby however if you would only like a quick bite there is a Chinese Terriyaki bar around the corner which is yummy and there is a Wendy's across from the hotel.
Next to the Chinese place there is also a Yoghurtland which is just amazing if you like frozen Yoghurt. 

The only thing I was a bit amused with was the gentleman who helped us store our luggage. Well he was nice enough and opened the door for us but he watched me lifting two heavy suitcases up on the storage area by myself always politely smiling instead of giving me a hand.

All in all I will definitely stay here again during my next trip to LA and I recommend this hotel without hesitation!",,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-27,"Dear Guest,

Cdearn,68,,2013-09-30,NONE,2013-09-26,2,Stay somewhere else....,"Check in was pleasant enough but the guy behind reception was more interested in selling us a bus tour.

The hotel has a very old musty smell. The rooms a more motel like and in need of a good clean and up date.

The breakfast was just OK. Only one egg/omlete per person, cereal, sometimes some fruit and pastries. 

We were charged $66 for parking for 3 nights - a bit of a rip off when the security guards leaves the gates open when he goes for lunch! 

I'm sure there are better hotels with good value for money - unfortunately for us this was not it.

You pay for parking at the rear of the hotel, but it's very secure and has lots of spaces. Unfortunately you can't get any meals there, other than breakfast and there aren't any nice restaurants close by. You'll need some transport as I would not walk anywhere in this area at night, in fact I wouldn't walk anywhere in Los  Angeles at night.

We were also surprised that there was no information booklet/guide in the room so making finding information about hotel services and local area was more difficult.  We found the staff polite and efficient but not overly friendly.  My friend was annoyed that the breakfast was advertised as 'hot buffet' but itwas really a continental buffet with an egg chef [egg chef WAS awesome] and only pork sausage and waffles as hot selections.  Also the line up for the one egg chef was tedious.  As we are finding in America, the coffee was bad - but this is not unique to this hotel.  The hotel location is on the outer edge of Hollywood and in a mostly Latino neighbourhood, also quite a few homeless but we were not bothered or asked for money etc.  The hotel is very close to the red line Metro station which made getting to Hollywood Blv and Universal studios very easy.  Overall we were quite satisfied with the hotel - we would recommend if you want a cheaper stay that is out of the hectic crowds of Hollywood - its not fancy but it has a certain charm.",,,,,,,,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-04-30,"Dear Guest,

Hollywood Hotel is affordable and we enjoyed our stay.....HOWEVER, with the great price you lose out a bit in location and the evening entertainment does kind of let the place down. Other than that this place rocks! 
For a hotel it ticks all the main boxes for family, safe although not really in an ideal location, more on the eastern edge of Hollywood - at night drive your car - don't walk here! Clean rooms and hotel in general, toilletries renewed daily, rooms are also good compared to European hotels - comfortable and clean, big flatscreen TV, FREE WI-FI (awesome!!), good aircon, really nice pool area, and what made my stay stand out was the all encompassing breakfast with all the trimmings - 5 star breakfast really! Great friendly professional staff (let them book your sightseeing activities for you), shout outs to the owner and the reception who were more than helpful in helping us arrange trips and info on the local area.
Location, it's in Los Feliz, technically in Hollywood but you need to drive 15-20 minutes to get into actual downtown Hollywood (ie. Walk of Fame/Chinese Theatre), 30 mins to Santa Monica beach, 25 mins to Beverly Hills, 35-45 mins to DisneyLand.

Ringo515,209,"Des Moines, Iowa",2013-08-31,SOLO,2013-08-24,4,Convenient & Close to Hollywood,"I was in LA for four nights to take in a couple ball games and sights of the area.  The hotel is very convenient to the Metro Red Line of the LA mass transit system which provides connection to other Metro lines and Union Station.  The closest station is Vermont & Santa Monica, approximately 2 blocks south of the hotel.

Breakfast was way better than anticipated, with more or less a full breakfast every morning.  

The room is a decent size for a single traveler or couple.  Be sure to request a room not on Vermont as it is quite loud and sirens pass by as it is a major street.  Bed was comfortable and everything worked as expected with regards to TV and internet.

The staff was courtesy and business like.  I am mostly self-sufficient, so I did not make any local inquiries.  

I was traveling without an automobile, so I was a frequent traveler on the Metro.  It was easy to ride and went to many of the places I needed to go.  A ride is $1.50 and the people in the Metro stations generally helpful and decent.  There is a good amount of homelessness around some of the Metro stations, I did not experience any aggressive panhandling except in Union Station.

The neighborhood is a little sketchy, with several Thai massage palors.  While I had little concern about safety, I didn't linger after sunset.  I did walk up to the Los Feliz area, which is a good walk and there are some interesting dining options and shops.",Do not stay on the Vermont Avenue side of the hotel.

Emma H,4,,2013-08-31,COUPLES,2013-08-14,3,Good travel links,"We stayed at the Hollywood Hotel for 4 nights. The main reason for choosing it was its proximity to public transport as we were travelling without a car. To get to the hotel we got the Flyaway bus from LAX to Union Station and then the Metro Red Line to Vermont/Santa Monica station. You can see the hotel as soon as you come out of the station, that's how close it is! We upgraded to a Suite at the hotel as the price was reasonable. The room was big with a seating area as well as a small dining area and kitchen but we felt that it was in need of some updating. Our room overlooked the courtyard, which is a lovely area with seating,plants and a fountain. Breakfast was included in the price and there was plenty of choice- the made to order waffles were especially good! The staff were friendly and helpful and arranged a taxi for us one night. If you are staying over a weekend, there is a shuttle bus to Griffith Observatory, which leaves from outside Vermont/Sunset Station just up the road. The bus costs 50cents and most of the museum is free. On Santa Monica Boulevard, just down from the hotel, you can catch a bus (#704) straight to Santa Monica, it takes about an hour and costs $1.50. The area directly around the hotel is definitely not the nicest, something I was concerned about after reading other reviews, but it was fine even when we walked back at night. The subway is also fine, despite what we were told and any trip is $1.50. If you head a couple of blocks to the right, the area does improve and there are places to eat and a supermarket. I would recommend a trip to Yogurtland, turn left out of the hotel and you're there! ",,,,,,,,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-04-30,"Dear Guest,

Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your stay with us. We value your business and we know you had many hotels to choose from. You have covered all aspects of your stay and we are particularly appreciative of your comments that you liked our location and rooms and that the best part of your stay was the complimentary hot buffet breakfast, the breakfast staff were friendly and and prepared excellent food.  Yes, we are the only hotel in Hollywood which offers complimentary made to order omelets for breakfast .... yet you gave us the second lowest score one could possibly give.... and yes ... it hurts.

We are not a 5 Star hotel but a small independently owned family run hotel which is usually to our guests benefit as we are able to respond more quickly to guests needs. I apologize for the excruciating checkin and I wish you had contacted us earlier why you thought the check in process was excruciating or how you thought we could change the checkin process more enjoyable. 

We are a Hollywood Classic and have been around a long time. It is important for Tripsdvisor readers to have a pretty good idea of what to expect when they are evaluating hotels in the Hollywood area. We are a small hotel with an inner courtyard. Most of our rooms have a balcony and all rooms have a refrigerator, microwave, hairdryer, flat screen TV and all channels are 100% HD, Sealy Posturepedic Beds with a pillow top mattress for extra comfort. All beds have 300 thread count snow white bed linens with a Duvet comforter. Linens are changed and washed daily. We serve a complimentary hot buffet breakfast with cooked to order omelettes in our restaurant from 6:30am - 10:30am. Families love us and kids stay and eat free too!

Please accept my apologies for the inconvenience for the squeaky box springs and your room view.. I am happy to report that we currently in the process of installing new platform beds which eliminates the need for any box springs.  All rooms have wood or tile floors which keep rooms smelling fresher and cleaner than carpets. We have many different views in the hotel and we could have changed your room to a room with a different view as well.

We have taken note of your positive and negative comments and will use these to monitor and improve the quality of services we offer to our guests.

If you would like to contact me direct about your stay, please email me at jeff@hollywoodhotel.net and we hope to serve you again soon.

The courtyard was beautiful.  Our room was overlooking it.  We were on the 3rd floor.  The first floor rooms on the courtyard didn't seem to have much privacy so I would recommend a higher floor.  Our room (single queen sized bed) was on the small side, but was still plenty of room for two people.  The bed was comfortable but the pillows were a little flat for my taste.  The room and hotel were very clean.  All the staff we interacted with were friendly.  The breakfast each morning was a plus.  They had made to order eggs and waffles.  The line for eggs could get long, so some mornings I skipped it, but the omelets were worth the wait.  There was also a good assortment of fruit, cereals, muffins, breads, and juices.  The Vermont/Santa Monica red line metro station is very close by and the subways are quick and easy.  The bus lines also run frequently.  We didn't have a car and got everywhere we wanted to go easily.  We did take the bus the wrong direction briefly, but as long as you know that the hotel is on the north side of Vermont Ave. that shouldn't be a problem.  At first, we were a little worried about the area at night, but we had no problems and walked at night time often.

jovercorb,12,,,,2013-07-30,3,Simply OK,"Stayed 4 nights. Found location great as everything we did was via the redline subway.

Room basic. Lighting not great.  Bathroom quite tired. Stayed in balcony room over looking courtysrd. Roon very hot AC didn't work great and couldn't open the balcony door due to smokers and their stinking ashtrays. 

Also the first night there was a hissing sound that seemed to be coming from the room next door (not a hotel room -sounded like hot water unit). It had stopped after house keeping had been. Assumed something turned off... next night it was back.  Not loud enough to keep us awake,  but may be annoying to some people.

Breakfast was basic but substantial.  Eggs limited to one serving. Boyfriend wanted extra and told no. Next day I ordered omlet and gave to him.... 

All staff were great.  Wouldn't stay here again as nothing in area. Served our purpose.

The reviews were mixed so I was a bit nervous. I would say that it is not the nicest hotel I have ever stayed at - the room was a bit small and could use a little TLC, but not  bad. I actually thought the common areas were very nice. The breakfasts were great. The best thing though was the nice gentleman in the small gift shop who let me take a map and pay later, as I did not realize it was cash only and was on my way out. And when I found him later to pay, he gave me a little candy just for bringing the money I owed. We did not use the pool area because it isn't heated and it wasn't hot enough out. The location was ideally suited for us because we were in town to explore the city. Paying for parking was not that big a deal - not that expensive really, and worth the freedom it allowed us to explore the area. But you would be able to get around without a car if you needed to.","If you can&#39;t get an interior facing room, ask for one facing out back.

- Our room was clean, the bed a bit too soft for our liking, but it is a hotel. We were on the first floor facing the courtyard and really should have taken advantage of this serene-looking space. The shower water pressure was amazing!
- The breakfast was super tasty - eggs and waffles prepared by the amazing Oralia. Yes, the restaurant is in the basement, but it didn't feel claustrophobic. 
- The neighbourhood wasn't pretty, but we never felt concerned for our safety. we walked from the hotel to the Observatory and a mere mile away is a very funky neighbourhood of shops and restaurants worth checking out.
- The parking did cost $22/day, but considering what we paid for 2 hours of street parking in other parts of LA, this was fair.

A small coffee machine was provided as well. There was a small desk with a comfy chair to work on and a flat screen over the desk that had a keyboard (I know you could purchase wifi and use it on the flat screen) I opted out of wifi.

LisamareeinHK,45,"Hong Kong, China",2013-05-31,FRIENDS,2013-07-16,3,2.5 Star Motel,"We chose this hotel because we got an exceptionally good deal and it came with recommendations from LA locals and this site. 

Hollywood Hotel is a basic 2.5 to 3 star motel which feels very dated and is in need of renovation. The street it is located on is very busy but our biggest concern was safety. As two women we did not feel safe walking the streets in this area and while it isn't the hotel's fault it didn't help this rating. We were foolish and thought we would walk to the Hollywood walk of fame from the hotel. Bad mistake. Over an hour to walk there and we were followed by a group of males on two different occasions as we walked. Only when we got to the touristy area did we feel ""safe"". Having said that, we then discovered the trains and felt a bit more comfortable as we could use them to get to Hollywood and Universal, etc. The train station was about a 5 minute walk up the road from the hotel.
We had a mixed bag experience with the reception staff. One of the ladies was incredibly helpful and gave us some great recommendations for food and sightseeing and genuine service with a smile. Another lady didn't seem to want to communicate with us at all when we asked for advice on shopping, but overall the staff were friendly and tried to help. 
The room was incredibly basic and when we first entered our room it smelt so badly of chlorine we had to open the doors to disperse the smell. Thankfully it didn't take too long and at least we knew the bathroom was clean. The bathroom was small but functional, however make sure you ask how to use the shower as it took us quite a while to figure it out (and we weren't the only ones). There were two double beds in our room. The beds were basic and functional - they served their purpose as a place to sleep.
The complementary breakfast was simple but adequate. The option to have freshly cooked waffles or an omelette was nice and the cooking staff were friendly. There were no other meals available at the hotel however I would recommend visiting Dresden's - a family-run steak restaurant which is 10 minutes walking distance up the road (reception can give you directions). 
There was a nice balcony at the back of the hotel (where the carpark is) on our floor where we could sit and watch the sunset on LA while having a drink. It was a lovely spot to unwind and absorb the history of the hotel which isn't obvious. If the hotel was renovated incorporating some of its history and had the history more visible for people to understand it could be a really quirky boutique hotel despite its location.
For what we paid (50% off), it was acceptable, however I would not pay full price for this hotel.
Would I stay here again? Probably not. I think I would rather spend a bit extra and stay in a  location closer to Hollywood sights with easier access in an area that felt a bit safer.",,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-04-30,"Dear Guest,

It was extremely noisy, and even though we were exhausted from the journey, it was close to impossible to sleep. The upside was that when we mentioned this the next morning we were moved to a much nicer room, that overlooked the inner court. The room was much cleaner too. When we first arrived we wanted to sit quietly in the bar, but that was closed. No offer of an alternative, and no food either. The breakfast was good and plentiful although woe betide anyone who asks for additional scrambled eggs, a firm no was the response! The weather was very hot when we stayed, but the swimming pool was freezing, I am not shy of outside pools, but this was impossible to get into.

CanadianItchyFeet,5,,2013-06-30,FRIENDS,2013-07-09,1,Mislead,"We chose this hotel based on the glowing reviews but were quickly disappointed.  While close to public transport, the hotel is far from the major tourist sites.  The desk staff were not helpful; the most obvious instance was when we returned one evening to find the balcony door to our room wide open.  We called the desk and were informed that the cleaning staff sometimes open the door to help the floor dry and had likely been open for 10 hours; no apology, no inquiry if anything was missing. 

The hotel itself is tired looking but clean and appears to contain asbestos (judging by signs in the breakfast area).  The website claims services that were unavailable (bell service, bar open infrequently).  The biggest positive was the staff at breakfast; they were lovely.  However, you should be aware that apart from breakfast there is no food available at the hotel as there is no on site restaurant; any food must be ordered in.",,2.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,hollywoodhotel,General Manager,2013-08-14,"Dear Canadian Itchy Feet

Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your stay with us. We value your business and we know you had many hotels to choose from. You have covered all aspects of your stay and we are particularly appreciative of your comments that you liked the hotel location, the hotel rooms and cleanliness AND most of all you liked the sleep quality of the hotel and our lovely breakfast staff.... yet you gave us the lowest overall score of 1 circle which I believe is misleading our dear Tripadvisor readers.... Ouch!!!

We are not a 5 Star hotel but a small independently owned family run hotel which is usually to our guests benefit as we are able to respond more quickly to guests needs. I apologize the desk staff were not helpful  and Ithat your balcony door was open. I wish you had contacted me earlier as I would have given you my personal best to help you with your needs and help make your stay more enjoyable. 

We are a Hollywood Classic and have been around a long time. It is important for Tripadvisor readers to have a pretty good idea of what to expect when they are evaluating hotels in the Hollywood area. We are a small hotel with an inner courtyard. Most of our rooms have a balcony and all rooms have a refrigerator, microwave, hairdryer, flat screen TV and all channels are 100% HD, Sealy Posturepedic Beds with a pillow top mattress for extra comfort. All beds have 300 thread count snow white bed linens with a Duvet comforter. Linens are changed and washed daily. We serve a complimentary hot buffet breakfast with cooked to order omelettes in our restaurant from 6:30am - 10:30am. Families love us and kids stay and eat free too!

We do NOT have asbestos in the hotel and we do not have signs in the breakfast area stating such nonsense. 

We have taken note of your positive and negative comments and will use these to monitor and improve the quality of services we offer to our guests.

tommyd44,3,,2013-07-31,FAMILY,2013-07-07,1,Hands-Down The Worst Hotel/Motel In The USA,"I'll start by admitting I'm a bit of a hotel snob, and proud of it. I spent over 20 years in the hospitality industry and I have a saying ""you spend 50 weeks a year catering to others needs, your job, your family.. why be cheap with yourself the 2 weeks that others serve you""?  You have a right to expect the best. Yes, I've stayed in many 5 star resorts, I've even stayed at a Motel 6 in my youth, and some in between. I don't expect 5 star amenities at 3 star places, but 5 star service should be automatic. The marketing staff of this hotel are either geniuses or con-artists because they shot the entrance which appears elegant, and little more. We laughed while unpacking our SUV when we saw a ""Thai-Massage"" place across the street, harkening I can't imagine who with pink neon signage. Ewwww...gross...There were no photos of the dark, dingy hallways, the absolutely filthy tile floors in the room, the rusty ""trap door"" above the shower, the cracked plastic fencing bolted on the previous rails on the patio of your room, the worst ""free breakfast"" I've ever seen located in what I'd describe as a dungeon (I believe they called it the ground level). I value my time too much to give a blow-by-blow of the worst ""hotel"" I've ever had the misfortune of visiting, but I fee obligated to warn readers about just how awful this place is. The rooms have cold ""white"" tile floors, I've never stayed in the cheapest motel that didn't have carpeting. My little boy had his socks off for barely 5 minutes before his feet were black. My years in the industry told me the reason they opted for tile floors was to make clean-up easier for the staff, but a 5 minute mop-job would have seen to it that the floors weren't filthy, no one mopped...I made my poor child leave his socks on the rest of our 14 hour stay. Upon arrival, no one greets you, there are half a dozen valet carts to serve yourself , humping your own suitcases is bad, pushing the astonishingly heavy cart down the long hallway and maneuvering it into the elevator when the wheels hardly turn was another..oh, and the first elevator was out of service. I got the feeling that sign was there for some time, so one elevator to cater to all the guests seemed ""inadequate"". You have to use your room card to operate the elevator, sometimes it worked, others it didn't and the door just kept popping open. The maid waiting to use the elevator seemed annoyed that she had to help us make it work, it took her 4 tries! (which also tells you the staff doesn't have a service elevator). The beds had those metal box springs that squeak like in a bad movie, the mattress had no life left in them whatsoever. My wife and I prayed we didn't have amorous neighbors to listen to...squeak squeak.
The shower/tub was 6 inches higher than the floor, my wife found this out the hard way when she fell like a ton of bricks when she stepped out of the shower, narrowly missing her head on the bathroom counter..the bruise on her hip is the size of a teacup saucer today, and growing larger. In your check-in packet is a coupon for the aforementioned Thai-massage"" sleaze pit...really? I asked my wife if the hotel also had hourly rates. Your patio is one long concrete slab shared with every neighbor, no privacy whatsoever, a meager 3 foot tall lattice meant to look like a fence separates you from them. Our neighbor had wet swim trunks and bathing suits hanging off the rail like a tenement, they obviously took a dip in the pool, one I'd only have used if it was pure chlorine. The bathroom had a perpetual musty smell, one that resembled the smell you get when you wash a load of laundry and forget to dry it for more than a day. The hallway still had those ashtrays affixed to the walls about every 30 feet, the ones from hotels in the 70's though it was a non-smoking hotel (all LA hotels have been smoke-free in the common areas for at least a decade, guess they just haven't gotten around to the arduous task of unscrewing them from the walls..I mean we're talking 4 screws and a Philips Head, one can understand why it's taken them 10 years to get to it...Dining; I went down to the ""buffet breakfast"" to grab my wife and son some fruit, coffee and perhaps a bowl of cereal...you guessed it, more bad news...I went near enough to the fruit to see the bananas were pre-cut in half (they wouldn't want us to have a whole banana for our $250 a night) and as a lifetime restaurateur, I immediately recognized they'd been previously refrigerated and re-served as they were brown both inside and out, I've never seen this done in any dining establishment, anywhere, ever!!! Parking is $22 a day, no valet of course, $22 a day for sef parking into the least accessible lot ever designed. You have to pull in the driveway and move your vehicle back and forth and still, you end up having to get out of your car to slide your room key card to enter, carjacking invitation anyone? This is the short list of things I hated about this abysmal excuse for a hotel, let's not forget I didn't even stay a full day. My wife and I breathed a sigh of relief when we pulled away, that pretty well sums up the worst experience I've ever had at any hotel or motel at any level, for any price, forget that it cost nearly $300 with parking. This is my review of ""The Hollywood Hotel"", the most hideous, unsafe, unsanitary and poorly run hotel in the USA.",,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-10-11,"

Dorina B,235,"Tallahassee, Florida",2013-06-30,FAMILY,2013-07-03,4,Good price to be in the center of L.A.,"Pros were that the room was of a decent size and was clean. The front desk staff was helpful when we asked questions. It's in a very central location so it's easy to get to Griffin Park, Hollywood, downtown, etc. very easily. From the outside it doesn't look like it would be all that great, but on the inside it really was. It was reasonably quiet as well (both guests and for being in the city). They have a complimentary breakfast that has all of your continental breakfast options as well as an omelet and waffle station. The air conditioner wasn't a loud, clunker like in usual hotel rooms and kept the room very cold (it was abnormally hot in L.A. while we were there). The beds were very comfortable. Overall, it was a really great experience and I don't really have too many complaints.

Cons were that it's $22 a day to park, which can get to be a little costly. They also put a $100 hold on your credit card when you check in that is returned to you (in due time) after your stay. Our room was located on the center of the building which overlooks the ""Garden Longue."" At night some guests would be down there and it could get noisy, but not unreasonably so. The shower was a tad small, as it's not a tub/shower combo, and the water never got to be very hot, but overall it was manageable. Other than that the bathroom was quite spacious.",,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-30,"Dear Guest,

Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your stay with us. We value your business and we know you had many hotels to choose from. You have covered all aspects of your stay and we are particularly appreciative of your comments that you liked our  nice hotel, clean rooms, friendly staff, free wifi, fridge in the room & great breakfast which is complimentary and includes cooked to order omelets and waffles.... yet you gave us only an average 3 circle rating probably because you mistakenly thought you were not in Hollywood! 

Let me take this opportunity to enlightened all Tripadvisor readers with a little history about the boundaries of Hollywood.  On September 20, 1937 the Los Angeles City Council adopted ordinance # 78499 fixing the legal boundaries for the Hollywood district.  The boundaries are very generous with Hyperion Avenue, Hoover Avenue and Riverside Drive as the Eastern Boundaries and the Cities of Beverly Hills and West Hollywood as the Western Boundaries.  The Southern boundary is Melrose Avenue and the Northern boundary is Mulholland Boulevard including Griffith Park.  

Hollywood is the only district within the City of Los Angeles with officially designated boundaries.  I uploaded a historical map which was made by the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce in 1937 for the Los Angeles City Council to adopt ordinance # 78499.  Please note Hollywood Hotel is located near marker #6 which was Hollywood Studios and marker #7 which was International Studios in 1937.

Little Armenia is a community within the District of Hollywood to commemorate the many Armenian immigrants which came to Hollywood.  Thai Town is another community within the District of Hollywood and is the only Thai ethnic designated neighborhood in the United States.

There are many nice restaurants within walking distance to the hotel and we have a custom made restaurant walking map and guide for hotel guests available at the front desk.  

We do offer a FREE PARKING AND MORE coupon for Tripadvisor members. If you look at the top of our Tripadvisor listing you will see it. The coupon states:
""Present this unexpired coupon at check-in. Not valid with other discounts or promotions. Free parking is for 1 vehicle for the length of the paid stay. No substitutions. Non-Refundable. Valid only if booked direct on official hotel website.""

We also offer a comprehensive answer to the frequently asked question: ""Is There Free Street Parking Around the Hotel?"" on our website which states...... Parking on almost any street overnight in Los Angeles will undoubtedly cost you more if you get a parking citation than parking in the hotel's gated lot. Almost every hotel in Los Angeles charges more than $25 plus 10% tax per night for parking. The Hollywood Hotel only charges $20 plus 10% tax. You can park in the residential side streets around the hotel without a permit and for the most park without time restrictions unless it's a street cleaning day. Carefully read the posted city signs otherwise you will get a citation if you don't move your Car on those days or during the no parking time frame. There will be somewhat of a walk to and from the hotel and your car, plus it will be unpredictable to even find a space as many of the residents park on the street as well. All the other street parking around the hotel is metered and good for a few hours before you have to reload the meter. If you oversleep and don't reload the meter, you might get a citation too. The hotel lot is gated and manned 24 hours by an attendant and is probably one of the prettiest landscaped parking lots in the city and very easy access to and from the hotel.

We are not a 5 Star hotel but a small independently owned family run hotel which is usually to our guests benefit as we are able to respond more quickly to guests needs. We are a Hollywood Classic and have been around a long time. It is important for Tripadvisor readers to have a pretty good idea of what to expect when they are evaluating hotels in the Hollywood area. We are a small hotel with an inner courtyard. Most of our rooms have a balcony and all rooms have a refrigerator, microwave, hairdryer, flat screen TVs with 100% High Definition (HD) channels and the latest Hollywood Movies also in HD, Sealy Posturepedic Beds with a pillow top mattress for extra comfort. All beds have 300 thread count snow white bed linens with a Duvet comforter. Linens are changed and washed daily. We serve a complimentary hot buffet breakfast with cooked to order omelettes in our restaurant from 6:30am - 10:30am. Families love us and kids stay and eat free too!

If you would like to contact me direct about your stay, please email me at jeff@hollywoodhotel.net and we hope to serve you again soon.

PastorMG,2,"Whitehall, Pennsylvania",2013-06-30,BUSINESS,2013-06-26,5,Great Place to Stay! Great staff! Awesome breakfast!,"The Hollywood Hotel is a nice place to stay in LA. It is all of a 3.5 to 4 star Hotel. The hotel is much more upscale than the area it was nestled in.  It was clean and comfortable. The front desk staff was extremely helpful, friendly and made me feel special. I was directed to a great Mexican restaurant and was given printed directions and menus.  The King sized bed was firm but nice. The Courtyard was inviting and you have access to a small balcony with a relaxing feel. Their free breakfast chefs will make you omelets and waffles {remember to tip them}.  They had a good variety of cold-cuts, cheese, cereal and breads. They had a one cup coffee maker in the room, fridge and microwave. The bathroom could use a little remodeling but was clean.  Internet access was free but very slow.  It was 0.2 miles from the metro train for access to down town and Hollywood.",,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-27,"Dear Guest,

BradFraser,43,"Melbourne, Australia",2013-05-31,FRIENDS,2013-06-24,3,Decent enough hotel located in a bit of a dodgy area..,"Hollywood Hotel is ok. Staff are very friendly and helpful, in particular reception. The rooms are a good size, with comfortable bedding and daily top ups of amenities like shampoo. The water pressure in the showers is no doubt among the best I've experienced from all the hotels I've stayed at. A small thing, but an important thing!! But the location is terrible. 

Yes it's in an excellent spot if you want to be near attractions like Universal Studios and the Hollywood Boulevard (The former being absolutely amazing, the latter being a complete waste of time - I've written quite a scathing review on the location if interested..), but it's a dodgy spot. Being woken several times each night by the loud blaring of a police car siren racing by seems to be common practice. Whilst we weren't staying at the hotel for its views, to open the curtains and see only a seedy Thai massage parlour across the road wasn't the greatest. And to top it all off when we were being driven to the hotel by our taxi driver from LAX, he seemed surprised we were staying where we were, and upon arrival he told us ""oh, there was a shooting just a half mile down the road the other night, you guys would be best to not venture out onto the streets after sunset"". Lovely. 

In fact good luck getting a cab anywhere in the area. Cabs don't pick up people off the streets, only from hotels, due to it being such a dodgy area. The hotel was kind enough to arrange cab service for us whenever we needed, but more often than not it was with a private company as opposed to a public taxi and thus cost us a lot more than a standard taxi would have (A one way trip from the hotel to Universal Studios for example cost us $30. For a ten minute tops drive when in comparison our 40 minute drive from LAX cost us $70).

The hotel does come with decent wifi and a breakfast with good selections of food, including being able to have an omelet custom made to your tastes, both of which are free for guests. If I were rating solely for the hotel, it'd likely score a bit higher. But the horrible location really does warrant dropping its overall score. A good place to stay if on a budget. Just don't go out after hours, especially if on your own. And that's not just me being paranoid, that was the advice from two different cab drivers.",,3.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,80

Daniel U,10,,2013-04-30,FAMILY,2013-06-19,4,a good Hotel in the middle of nowhere,":: LOCATION:
Located in the middle of nowhere, but you get almost anywhere quickly and easily go from there. Whether by car or by public transport. 

Directly in front of the hotel is a bus stop which cover some connections. About 300 meters away you will find the underground station and another bus stop. From here the express bus depart to Beverly Hills or Santa Monica (journey time approx 60 min.).
With the subway you can reach for example Hollywood, Universal Studios, Downtown  or the Staples Center in a few minutes. Long Beach also be reached directly with the subway lines. By the way a weekly pass costs only $ 20, with which you can use both bus and subway as often as you like. We found the public transport as a good and cheap alternative to the car.
Several fast food restaurants and a grocery store are also near the hotel.

On the subject of safety due to other reviews we had our doubts. Luckily, we were positively surprised here. While there is in front of the hotel a few homeless people and a few strange guys, but in the 2 weeks of our stay in the hotel we never had to make any negative experiences. Whether in the day or late at night.
Certainly you have to be a little careful. But if you treat people with respect and do not walk with your Rolex down the street, then you will have no problems usually. We felt pretty safe even after midnight on the street or even in the subway.

:: HOTEL:
The hotel itself looks from the outside rather conservative and inconspicuous. A rectangular building, which offers little to the eyes.
Luckily, it looks quite different inside. Although the furniture already seem to be a bit older, but because the furnishings are all top quality, this is ok and even have style. Especially we liked the courtyard, which is quiet and beautifully designed. The reception is open 24 hours a day and provides all the services which you would expect. Unfortunately, some people here might be a bit more friendly and helpful. But it was fine. A small shop completes the offer at the ground floor.

The hotel also offers a sauna and a fitness room.  But because we did not used them, we can not report about it.

Outside the hotel there was a small pool area with good sunbeds and a small garden. Although the road is near, there it was relatively quiet - a little oasis in the city.

:: Breakfast:
The hotel offers a buffet breakfast if desired. This is in comparison to most other hotels in the U.S. very well. The breakfast room is located at the basement of the hotel and is very nicely designed and comfortable. The staff has always been very friendly and has delicious fresh cooked waffles and omelets for guests every day. There is plenty of fruit, a wide range of cereals and breads. There was Marmeldade, peanut butter and even Nutella. Salami and cheese was also present. There was delicious fruit juices and chilled water. Great! The coffee was ok.

:: Rooms: 
Our room was surprisingly large, but unfortunately due to the size of the room a bit dark. But there are many lamps, what give the room enough light.  The furniture was a bit dated, but for that they were high quality. 

We had two large beds that were very comfortable. Furthermore, there was a desk and a small table with two chairs. The fridge, microwave and small coffee maker were helpful. Also an iron and ironing board was present. Unfortunately, there was no wardrobe, just a hanging rail. A large LCD television was available and offered many American programs and even video on demand. 
Free wifi throughout the hotel. In the rooms there are even free internet via cable. This was in comparison to many other hotels very fast, so that you could make good use of this. A great advantage to many other hotels.

Our room also had a balcony from which we had a good view of downtown. The bathroom was clean and equipped with everything necessary. It was bright and had a large mirror and a hair dryer. The shower was very spacious and offers plenty of hot water. Only criticism: The shower head was not removable. 
The temperature of the room can be regulated with the air conditioning. Also an electric heater for colder days was available. 
The room service was friendly and good. The room was cleaned daily and the towels were changed daily. 

:: CONCLUSION:
An cheap alternative to most expensive hotels in perhaps a better location. But the excellent access to the public transport system, make the location not so bad. Especially the large comfortable room and excellent breakfast was what we liked. We felt very comfortable in the hotel and look forward to the next stay in this hotel. Thank you Hollywood Hotel.

HPSam,34,"Mumbai, India",2013-06-30,BUSINESS,2013-06-14,4,Nice hotel at a convenient location,"I read a lot of reviews here before booking this hotel that said it was in an unsafe or shady neighbourhood. It may not be in the most lively areas of LA, but its definitely safe. There are some big hospitals in the area so there are always lots of cops around. I've walked around late in the night as well and there were no problems. You'll have to travel a bit to visit the sight seeing areas but the hotel is very close to the Metro station, so it's very convenient. And while it isn't quite in Hollywood, it's close enough and also quite close to downtown.

Coming to the hotel, my room was quite clean and quiet with a nice view of the courtyard. The hotel does have a peculiar smell though. Not exactly a bad odour but you'll definitely notice it even if it won't bother you much. The complementary breakfast is great with live counters for eggs however you like them and waffles. Lots of cereal, bread and juice options as well.

I was here mostly for work and a little sightseeing so I was barely in the hotel, so it worked just fine for me. The wifi is quite spotty, but its free and decent enough for email and light browsing.

I'd recommend this hotel if you're by yourself and aren't easily spooked by shady ""looking"" neighbourhoods. The standard room rates are not quite worth what you're getting but they had a deal for international travellers so it was worth that discounted rate.",Pick a room on an upper floor with the courtyard view.

HD76HD76,149,"Sacramento, California",2013-05-31,COUPLES,2013-05-27,4,"Very good hotel, i definitely recomend it","I chose this hotel based on the reviews on trip advisor, and at the time we reserved it it had an offer on the pricing

PROS:
-FRIENDLY STAFF/ the whole staff was very friendly, especially gisel at the front desk, she helped me with directions every morning on our way out.
-VERY CLEAN ROOMS AND BATHROOMS/ the cleaning staff did a great job in cleaning the rooms, especially the bathrooms which were very clean, and they provide you with complimentary toiletteries every day ( shampoo, conditioner, soap, shower cap and mouth wash)
-QUIET ROOMS/ the hotel is very quiet and the isolation is super, you can't hear other guests or any weird sounds
-SUPERB BREAKFAST/ one of my favorite things about this hotel is the breakfast buffet, so many things to chose from, they offer ( 10 types of cereals with milk or water, fresh sliced fruits including watermelons melons apples kiwis pineapples melons bananas and apples, two kinds of sliced cheese and small tubs of cream cheese, four kinds of juices in addition to cold water, jams in addition to chocolate sauce and peanut butter, fresh berry sauce which i loved alot, an essortment of bagels and muffins and pastries in different flavors, the waffle station, the egg station where a very sweet chef makes you eggs the way you like with your choice of veggies and meat, sausages, hot chocolate, two kinds of coffee caffienated and decaffienated, one kind of tea).
And the staff at the breakfast area is so friendly, from the nice ladies making you waffles and eggs to the kitchen chief who was friendly and a hard worker
-LOCATION / the hotel is 2 blocks away from the metro station, so without a car it was conveniet to use it to go wherever we want to go, and if the areas you are going to have no metrostation, use their buses, so i highly recommend you the travellers without a car to buy a TAP card to use it on your transportation, so even if you return late to the hotel, no problem, becaust you only have to ride the metro back to the hotel
-the room contains a mini fridge, a microwave, a coffee/tea maker with complimentary coffee and tea, and an office
-SUBWAY/there is a subway store in front of the metrostation, so when we return to the hotel we make our way to subway and buy fresh sandwiches , and there are other restaurants and grocery stores in the nearby areas to chose from in addition to a RITE-AID store

CONS
-our bed was squeaky, so at the first night every time my husband turns i wake up, but i got used toit the other nights
- it would be nice if they put a safe in each room
-i would love if they put much more varieties of teas in the breakfast buffet, especially for tea drinkers like us
- i wasn't very fond about the neighbourhood, as it was a regular area with nothing to see around

OVERALL
 I really loved the hotel despite the minor cons and i highly recommend it.
We enjoyed our stay alot since we didn't encounter anything unpleasant",,,,,,,,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-30,"Dear Guest,

Ibrahim B,4,"State College, Pennsylvania",2013-05-31,COUPLES,2013-05-16,3,Ok for the price,"Pros: 
- Close location for people who like to stay in Hollywood area. 
- A lot of restaurants and retail around the hotel
- Very good rates on third party websites like hotwire
- Gated and spacious parking
- Complimentary breakfast... serving omelets, cereals, fruits, bread 

Cons:
- Expensive parking... you can find hotels cheaper than $22/day for parking
- No complimentary water in the room ... staff advice the guest not to use vending machines on site as they wont refund your money in case the machine took your money and gave you nothing
- House keeping did not change the bed sheets even when instructed to do so by me and by hotel staff
- THE MOST IMPORTANT: no AC... The vent blow fan air ... it was really hot and difficult to sleep
- Very noisy beds that keep squeaking when one flip sides while sleeping",Ask for a room facing the parking rather the street so it would be less noise and good view of parking vegetation,3.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,,,,,2

After confronting him that this is not right in my opion I was adressed ""that the only way I had is,to eather stay in the assigned room ore to check out and I could do what I wanted the US were a free country"".

Firstly, it is an older hotel, not the Ritz, and for the prices they charge, I think it' s a nice clean hotel, close to the metro  line which can get you to all the main attractions.

I stayed in a standard queen room, which was a little on the small side, but I had everything I needed including a private bathroom, mini fridge and microwave, flatscreen t.v, and breakfast included in the mornings which had an array of cereals, fruit, an egg bar, sweet buns and pastries, juices, coffee & tea.

The staff were friendly enough and helped with any questions I had.

Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your stay with us. We value your business and we know you had many hotels to choose from. You have covered all aspects of your stay and we are particularly appreciative of your comments that you liked our great location, and the overall good value you received... yet you gave us the lowest score one could possible give.... and yes ... it hurts.

We are not a 5 Star hotel but a small independently owned family run hotel which is usually to our guests benefit as we are able to respond more quickly to guests needs. I wish you had contacted us earlier about your stay instead of waiting over 7 months! We are a Hollywood Classic and have been around a long time. It is important for Tripadvisor readers to have a pretty good idea of what to expect when they are evaluating hotels in the Hollywood area. We are a small hotel with an inner courtyard. Most of our rooms have a balcony and all rooms have a refrigerator, microwave, hairdryer, flat screen TV and soon all channels will be 100% HD, Sealy Posturepedic Beds with a pillow top mattress for extra comfort. All beds have 300 thread count snow white bed linens with a Duvet comforter. Linens are changed and washed daily. We serve a complimentary hot buffet breakfast with cooked to order omelettes in our restaurant from 6:30am - 10:30am. Families love us and kids stay and eat free too!

Please accept my apologies for the inconvenience for the noisy vending machines and the smell in the suite. I am happy to report that we have since renovated the suite and replaced the carpets in all rooms with wood floors which keep rooms smelling fresher. We have taken note of your positive and negative comments and will use these to monitor and improve the quality of services we offer to our guests.

The hotel is about an hours walk from the Chinese Theater I should know as I walked there and back. It was okay walking there in the middle of the afternoon but I would not recommend walking back if you are doing it after 5pm as I'm not frightened of anything but some of the people (beggars etc) that seem to come out after that time can be pushy.

The hotel was a great base if you want to use the tube to go to either Hollywood or Universal Studios, I did this a few times when I was there and never felt threatened.

The hotel itself offers a breakfast and fitness facility but I never felt the need to use the latter.

When we arrived at the hotel we was greeted by Devon and given our room key. At first view of the room was lovely big and clean and the wheelchair was fully assesable. Beds was very comfy and air con in the room was very good.  
Breakfasts was very nice, many thanks to Hugo who made my mum a omelette everyday. Knowing she was disabled he brought her omelette he made to the table which was lovely of him, he really made the effort. 
After looking at trip advisor for months before our stay I was worried about what we had booked but after being there myself I cannot fault this hotel. The price for what you pay is amazing.
The staff there are lovely gisel, cecile, Devon from front desk was great and very friendly. Starline tours let us down one day and gisel made the effort to look up going to the tour a different way. Both Devon and gisel printed out maps for us for places we could go in LA and nothing was too much trouble for them. I couldn't of asked for a better team around us for our stay. 
We met jeff as we was leaving to thank him and just like everyone else he was lovely.

We booked a couple of tours through them to Disneyland and a Hollywood tour and they were excellent and everything went smoothly.
The free breakfast everyday was great and the Free Wi-Fi worked excellently. 
Only one gripe I had was that I booked a taxi through the front desk to Staples Centre to watch the Clippers and the taxi that came had no metre and then charged me $30 for the trip. The way home cost less than $20 and the next trip for the Lakers game cost the same. Maybe look at which Taxi cab service they use?",,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-30,"Dear Guest,

Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your stay with us. We value your business and we know you had many hotels to choose from. You have covered all aspects of your stay and we are particularly appreciative of your comments that you liked the overall good value you received... yet you gave us the lowest score one could possible give.... and yes ... it hurts.

Yes, you are right we are not a 5 Star hotel but a small independently owned family run hotel which is usually to our guests benefit as we are able to respond more quickly to guests needs. We are a Hollywood Classic and have been around a long time. It is important for Tripadvisor readers to have a pretty good idea of what to expect when they are evaluating hotels in the Hollywood area. We are a small hotel with an inner courtyard. Most of our rooms have a balcony and all rooms have a refrigerator, microwave, hairdryer, flat screen TV and soon all channels will be 100% HD, Sealy Posturepedic Beds with a pillow top mattress for extra comfort. All beds have 300 thread count snow white bed linens with a Duvet comforter. Linens are changed and washed daily. We serve a complimentary hot buffet breakfast with cooked to order omelettes in our restaurant from 6:30am - 10:30am. Families love us and kids stay and eat free too!

Please accept my apologies on behalf of the Hollywood community.  Thank you for complimenting our photos.  All photos on our website were taken by our in house staff and mostly with simple devices such as iPhones. No photos were photoshopped.  We have taken note of your positive and negative comments and will use these to monitor and improve the quality of services we offer to our guests.

RP_traveller_2013,181,"Toronto, Canada",2013-02-28,FRIENDS,2013-02-24,3,Good Value and Location,"I was a bit nervous booking at the Hollywood Hotel based on some of the previous reviews.  However, the value for the rooms  for a 5 day stay (got a good deal on hotels.com) was great and I was pleasantly surprised at the size of the room (it was a corner suite).  We had 2 queen beds, a microwave, fridge, and sofa and table and chairs.  The room was on the 3rd floor and faced south and was very quiet.It wasn't sparkling clean, but not dirty either.  Unfortunately the airconditioner wasn't working during our 5 day stay and our room smelled like fresh varnish.  And if you need any supplies at night (shampoo / toilet paper) there are no housekeeping staff late at night and the front desk staff state they have no access to their supplies!  Additionally, the housekeeping staff do not consistently replace toilet paper /shampoo / soap when they clean your room.  However, overall the front desk staff are courteous and helpful. The courtyard is beautiful and is a nice place to relax. Wireless internet was free with a good connection.  The continental breakfast was standard, but had a decent variety. The location of the hotel is excellent.  A 2 min walk to the Vermont / Santa Monica Metro which is a few stops from Hollywood / Universal Studios / Universal City walk and a few stops to downtown LA.  The Los Feliz neighbourhood is minutes away (recommend taking a 5 min cab ride), with great restaurants on HillHurst. There are a few strange characters on the street late at night, but otherwise, it's fairly safe to walk to and from the metro to the hotel during the day and night.  There's a Rite Aid pharmacy, Staples and Ralphs (grocery) store within walking distance.  There are also several restaurants that deliver to the hotel (there is a restaurant listing in each room.).  Hotel parking is a bit pricey ($20/night). Overall, it's a good value hotel, that is in a very convenient location.","Pick a room on the 3rd floor, south side, corner suite",4.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,,,,95
longislanderlloyd,29,"Long Beach, New York",2013-02-28,NONE,2013-02-22,5,Great value and a very pleasant experience,"We just returned from a visit to SoCal and we enjoyed it all, especially our 3 nights at the Hollywood Hotel. This was my 2nd time staying there since I was very pleased the first time 2 years ago.
It was very relaxing there, especially sitting on our terrace and in the beautiful center courtyard. The room was very clean, including the full sized bathroom. The bed was very comfortable, and the room included a big screen TV, a workdesk, a microwave oven, a coffemaker, and a refrigerator. It even had an iron and ironing board. All the comforts of home, and very quiet there at night.
OK. The room was a bit on the small side, but we requested a 1st floor room so it had a sliding door and a terrace to sit out on.
The breakfast is included and its a full hot buffet with made-to-order eggs and waffles, plus the usual fruits, breads, yogurts, and cereals. You can't find a better one anywhere.
It has a beautiful outdoor pool nearby, but it was not swimming weather in Feb.
The hotel is NOT in the middle of Hollywood, steps away from all the theatres and tourist attractions, but it is right off the Hollywood Freeway and a short walk to Santa Monica Blvd and Sunset Blvd. It is recommended that you park your car in their secured lot overnight for a $22 daily fee. Its worth it for the convenience and security, or take the 2 mile train or cab ride to Hollywood & Vine.
Its well worth the money and is a good 2nd choice if you can't get into the Magic Castle Hotel or don't  want to pay their higher room rates.

drd83,131,"Durham, North Carolina",2012-10-31,FRIENDS,2013-02-16,3,Great breakfast and close to Metro,"The main reason that I am giving this hotel 3 stars instead of 4 is that the room and bed were very tiny.  It was barely big enough for 2 people.  The room itself was nice, but it was small.  The complimentary breakfast was very good, even though they are very strict about people not leaving the dining room with food.  The gift shop was so-so, it was also rather small.  This was my first time in California and I did not realize that Hollywood was quite as run-down as it is.  However, the hotel is very close to the Vermont and Santa Monica station as well as it is on several bus-lines. Since we were traveling without a car, this was extremely helpful.  We were able to go to Hollywood Blvd and see the sites within minutes and able to go all the way to Beverly Hills and Santa Monica in a fairly short amount of time.  WE got a good deal on it, so it was worth what we paid for.  Just wish the room was slightly larger!",,4.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,,,,,25
cavaluvr10,1,,2013-02-28,COUPLES,2013-02-09,4,Very happy with our room & the complimentary breakfast!,"As opposed to some recent reviewers of this hotel, we felt we'd made a very good choice for our one-night stay.  My husband was scheduled for a medical procedure at Kaiser's Sunset & Vermont hospital early on a morning when rain was expected, so we decided that, rather than brave the congealed traffic we'd face driving in from LA's West Valley on that morning, we'd come into Hollywood the night before & stay over.  A friend recommended Loew's Hotel, near Hollywood & Highland, but when we realized we'd have to pay $250 + parking, we looked elsewhere!  With the Auto Club discount, our room at the Hollywood Hotel was well under $100 for the night, plus we had free parking in the gated lot & a free hot breakfast served early enough (6:30) to allow me to eat before we went off to the hospital.  I had a freshly made omelet with sprinklings of fresh veggies in it, fresh fruit, toast, OJ, coffee, a tiny danish pastry & a small muffin.  I could also have had a cupcake-sized waffle if I'd wanted, plus an assortment of cheeses & cold meats.  (One curious thing:  there was no real milk for the coffee--only that liquid synthetic Coffee Mate stuff; they provided real 2% milk for the cereal, but 2% milk isn't sufficient to substitute for the 1/2 & 1/2 many people like in their coffee.) 

   Our room (no.331--no view, alas, though there was a great view of the city from one end of the hall via a nice balcony) had a queen-size bed in it, which meant that it was fairly small, but it had numerous places to sit & also to put luggage down on--unlike some European hotels we've stayed in where we could barely find space to put stand our suitcases upright & closed(!), never mind sit anywhere except on the bed.  It had a small table & 2 chairs in a tiny alcove which also had the closet & a counter with a sink where the microwave & fridge were located.  The bathroom was also fairly small, but it had enough counter space for all of our toiletries.  There was plenty of really HOT water, available instantly when you turned on the faucet, & there was a new shower head installed over the tub, which gave a very nice needle-like shower.  The bed was very comfortable & high off the floor--it looked & felt like it was new, as did the wood floors, all the bathroom fixtures, the temperature controls, & the TV.  If I'd brought my laptop, there would've been free wi-fi.

   The parking lot was out in the open (i.e., not in a closed structure) & the surrounding gate would open to anyone who could push a button--I thought they could have made it more secure by requiring use of the room's key card to open the entry gate.  There was easy access to the hotel from the parking lot, though the lot's entrance was around the corner from the hotel.  I also thought that the Management should have kept all the hotel's doors locked except the main one in front, & required use of one's room key card to open those as well.  This isn't the greatest neighborhood in LA, so a bit more caution in keeping the building secure would not be amiss. 

   The hotel was located very close to the Kaiser hospital, it took only a few minutes to get there, which, from our point of view was a great blessing!  I will keep this hotel in mind if we have another such situation that requires us to be at this Kaiser facility very early in the morning, as it is so convenient & has so many things to recommend it.","I might prefer staying on the first floor next time, as the upper rooms get a bit warm in the late afternoon.",5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-30,"Dear Guest,

Babydonutx,212,"London, United Kingdom",2013-01-31,COUPLES,2013-02-05,4,"The photo of the ""front"" is actually the back","We've just come back from staying at this hotel for 10nights. It was great. Nothing too special but not as bad as the ""poor"" reviews are saying.

We stayed in a very nice room with a queen bed, big enough for us two to share. The room was spacious enough that we didn't have to be tripping over our cases. There were plenty of drawers, a nice alcove part with the ironing board and fridge and microwave. There was a flat screen TV which had plenty of channels.

It's within walking distance of 2 Metro stops (kinda in the middle but closer to Vermont/SantaMonica). This gave us easy access to all of LA. Sure the area looks a little ghetto but it's not like you need to spend all your time around there. 

It's pretty safe because there are people everywhere.

The only thing negative to say was that the fridge makes A LOT of noise in the night and there was a weird ticking which we never found out what it was.
It wasn't a problem for us (the noise) but if you are a light sleeper it might be.

We had a room facing the courtyard and it was pretty quiet most of the time. Occasionally there were people who must've gone on the balcony for a fag or something cos we'd hear talking in the night. 

All in all, a good, clean, place to stay and value for money :)

The trouble came when I had a medical emergency and had to check out early and was still made to pay for the two days I was not using.  I checked out by 9:30 am and informed them the night before, but they would not refund a cent.  

I was here for cancer care and my son got very sick on the othr side of the country where we live.  He was admitted to the children's hospital.

boygav,86,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",2012-09-30,COUPLES,2013-02-01,4,"Hardly glamorous, but good value","Being an ignorant Brit, I figured staying in Hollywood would mean hot and cold running models / actresses / whatevers in every room, red carpets on every street and the cops chasing Lindsay Lohan down every street. I was quickly disabused of this ridiculous notion as I pulled up to the Hollywood Hotel.

As others have noted, the location at Vermont and Santa Monica Boulevard looks a little iffy. You're a good bit away from the 'action' of Hollywood Boulevard (here's a tip - avoid at all costs, it's rubbish anyway) and, at first glance, there appears to be little charm about the immediate neighbourhood, with nothing but shops with metal shutters, Thai 'massage' parlours and grim bars with no windows nearby. 

Apart from that, though, the Hollywood Hotel has a lot to recommend it. Can't understand any of the comments about the decor and furniture being out of date - maybe we struck it lucky, but our room looked brand new. Housekeeping was impeccable, the heating / air-con worked like a charm, the bed was huge, clean and comfortable and there was a new(ish) flat screen TV. 

As so often on our trip around California, there wasn't a safe in the room, which was rather inconvenient, but the front desk staff were terrifically helpful and polite, despite my constant demands to take stuff in and out of their safety box at reception. 

Breakfasts were good, as others have noted, but it definitely pays to get there early, as the pastries and fruit do go quickly. If you're on vacation, you've got no excuse for lazing in your bed anyway, so chop chop.

The hotel was booked as part of a package with about half a dozen other places on our trip, so I can't really remember how much it cost. However, compared to some of the hotels up on Hollywood Boulevard, it probably offers much better value. And unless you're actively itching for something to complain about, if you have the sense you were born with, you should be able to negotiate a decent rate - or even pay nothing at all, like we did - on the parking front, so you shouldn't have to worry about how much it's costing you to leave your car there. 

I mentioned earlier the neighbourhood appearing a bit grotty on first impressions. However, after a couple of days of hopping in and out of the useful subway station next door, marvelling at the wonders of the 24 hour bus (route 4) which effortlessly ferries you to and from the fantastic West Hollywood, and taking the short walk up Vermont into Los Feliz with its great bars and restaurants, the location actually became a benefit rather than a hindrance.

Despite its evocations of classic showbusiness, with its pictures of golden age stars on the walls, I doubt many celebs come to check in to the Hollywood Hotel. Their loss, I'd say.",,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-30,"Dear Guest,

Daizie,5,"Brisbane, Australia",2013-01-31,COUPLES,2013-01-31,1,"The worst hotel we have ever stayed in, and we've stayed in bad places.","PLEASE do not stay here!

I understand people can stay in hotels and sometimes it just depends on the room, here my brother moved rooms 3 times and had nothing but trouble, we moved once. First of all the room they were checked into was having maintenance (don't check someone into a room if its not ready) and the second one resulted in waking up with multiple bites from bedbugs (The woman behind the counter argued with us saying it was checked regularly and fumigated, she then brought out the sheet that was signed when this was done and it was last checked on the 9th of jan). The room we stayed in, the heating didn't work and the toilet took 7 times to flush one piece of toilet roll so we moved rooms to a bigger one which was a lot better.

We then decided to wash our clothes, disaster! the vendor ate my money, so receptionist told me 'yeah they aren't that good but we can't give you a refund' then the dryer ate our money which we also couldn't be refunded for.  
All the menus in the book aren't updated and are all wrongly priced.
I tried to call a pizza place but the phone said 'unable to connect call' and they still charged me a dollar for it (I know its a dollar but it shouldn't have been taken if the call wasn't connected) We then called reception for the new number and she said dial this and you can call for free, which we also got charged for.
They want $100 deposit for any damages, which has now left us with nothing to do for our last day of the holiday (keeping a credit card on file for damages is fine, then at least we have our money!) we gave the money in cash because our prepaid card takes a long time to put it back on but they still took $100 out of our bank as well! so we paid $200 deposit for our room, ridiculous. My brother paid $100 on their card which they stated would not be refunded in time for us leaving which they were promised it would be. The refunded payment was then declined and when the issue was stated with reception the guy behind the counter just blatantly said 'well youve lost $100 then because there is nothing we can do. 
The rooms aren't even that cheap and you get what you pay for, crap rooms on a crap street.
Please, if you want cheap, stay in a crappy hotel that's closer to a nice part of hollywood, The place is terrible and the reception staff are so rude it's unreal. Every problem we had was dealt with rudeness and arguments. One of the front desk staff even laughed at us when we were stating an issue with our room. While coming in and out of this hotel we have witnessed at least 10 other customers complaining at the front desk.
At the end of the stay we hung around until our taxi was ready and stored our luggage 'safe'in their storage area. When we got them out the handle on my suitcase has been snapped off! I can't begin to stress how much this place is disgustingly run and a pathetic attempt at even 1 star never mind the amount they claim to have.
We have stayed in really bad places but this is by far the worst. Stay away,",,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-10-12,"Dear Guest...

What separates the Hollywood hotel from all the other hotels I stayed at was definitely the customer service, most notably from Cecille. Not only was the service from Cecille very personalised, it was also genuine and demonstrated her sincerest desire that my boyfriend and I have the most pleasant stay at the hotel. As it was our final leg of our holiday we first thought that we would not be able to maximize our time spent in l.a because our lack of research on the area, however after a brief chat with Cecille upon checking in she instantaneously opted to help us organise all the sights and scenes the area has to offer. She gave us maps, genuine advice and all the help we needed, leaving us feel very excited about the days to come. Cecille helped us organise our tours, visit to Disneyland and universal studios and even helped us in organising a shuttle bus to return back to the airport on our final day. On top of organising all of that Cecille also managed to do it all with such grace and a beautiful smile! We can't thank her enough!! ..back to the hotel itself. Although it isn't the most extravagant looking hotel, it has many services that are often forgotten in many other hotels of the same price range. We were offered complimentary breakfast including an assortment of muffins, omelettes, cereals and waffles. There was also a laundry service, swimming pool, gym, bar and much more too! The room was everything you needed in a hotel room. It was clean, fresh and we were even given a balcony that had a lovely view of the court yard and stunning view of the outskirts of Hollywood. Everyday we returned back to a clean room with fresh linen and a new set of shampoo, conditioner and soap! It was really nice to receive such amazing service! Definitely something not received in large scale hotels whose staff are often too busy and too money hungry to help their holiday stayers. All in all my stay at the Hollywood hotel was most enjoyable. I salute all the amazing staff for allowing me a pleasant stay! Special kudos goes out to Cecille again for her personalised service!

dandmsanderson,9,"Adelaide, Australia",2012-11-30,COUPLES,2013-01-29,4,Will stay again without hesitation,"My wife and I recently spent 2 weeks at Hollywood Hotel. It was a pretty big deal for us (we have 6 children whom we were leaving for 2 weeks) and there was a lot riding on getting the choice of hotel right. Price was a major consideration as we needed to work to a tight budget.  

We did a lot of homework before making a decision. We first contacted Jeff via email about 12 months prior and he promptly answered all of our questions and offered further information which we found most helpful. At the time of our first contact there was a special discount of 50% for international guests staying for 5 nights or more. When we actually came to make our booking some 12 months later we contacted Jeff again. I could not locate the same discount rate and, on advising Jeff of this, he advised it had been there for a limited time, however he would reactivate it for our visit. 

We had read reviews which discussed the hotel being in an 'unsafe area' and some individual reports of concerns about cleanliness. This being our first time to the USA together we were somewhat nervous about how things would play out. As it turns out we were immensely satisfied with the experience. Having spent about 18 hours travelling, we arrived well before check-in time. We were happy to find that the room type we had requested had indeed been held for us (upper floor, courtyard with safe). Whilst not available there and then, the staff pointed us in the direction of some local restaurants and suggested we give them a call to ensure the room was ready on our return. 

The hotel does not claim to be the Hilton or Ritz Carlton, but you're not paying that sort of money for the room. The room was clean and fresh, the service staff were helpful. The phone worked, the internet was not always the quickest but was generally quite serviceable and certainly capable of streaming video which we did on a few occasions. The microwave worked, the fridge was cold, but the coffee machine makes American coffee which (no offence intended) is pretty awful anyway. The room was quiet and generally the temperature was quite pleasant. One reviewer commented that the bed squeaked a lot. This is true, though can be mitigated considerably by the judicious placement of some socks on the metal bars that run under the bed. Thereafter - no squeakiness - just remember to remove them before you leave! Also, the temperature while we were there was quite pleasant (mostly around 20 celsius). When we had reason to use the cooler it did drop the temperature, though not sure how effective it would be on a hot day.

A couple of reviewers have said the neighbourhood is unsafe. In my opinion this is utter rubbish. As first time visitors to LA we were a little nervous about personal safety but within a day we were very comfortable walking around the local area. We shopped in the local shops and walked to local restaurants without any concerns.

Others have talked about the location. Whilst it isn't in easy walking distance of some of the main Hollywood attractions, it is about a 3 minute walk from the nearest Metro Red Line stations. Right out the front of the hotel is a bus stop. We bought Metro Tap Cards at the local Metro station for $1 and loaded weekly credit on them which cost $20 each for unlimited trips. The Metro Red Line takes about 7 or 8 minutes to get you to Hollywood and puts you straight onto Hollywood Blvd. We went to a concert at the Hollywood Bowl by Metro and out to Universal City. We caught buses to and from LAX - all cheaply and conveniently. Hollywood is not outside your front door, but it's about 10 minutes away and the difference you'll pay in accommodation makes it worth it.

Some folks have griped about the parking. It's $18 per day plus tax. I parked there for 3 nights and didn't really like having to pay for parking. So I parked on the street instead. There are a couple of side streets - Lexington to the north and a little no-through road to the south. Parking is free 8pm - 8am and then will cost you $2 for 2 hours. Make sure you get up at 8am to put money on the meter (credit card accepted - couldn't be easier) as it will cost you $63 plus for the pleasure of parking without a green light on the meter. I parked on the street for several nights - no problems whatsoever (except for 1 parking ticket - that was an expensive alarm to sleep through).

Some people have complained about the breakfast. To them I say get a life. There are 10 varieties of breakfast cereal, various muffins, bagels, pastries and breads, at least 4 offerings of juice and fresh fruit each day. Yes you have to queue for the 'egg station' which offers your choice of omelette with about 8 different fillings or you can have eggs - scrambled, fried, egg white only etc etc. Or if you don't eat eggs you can have a flour tortilla cooked with your choice of fillings also. Did I mention the sausages too? And if these aren't your cup of tea, then you can have freshly made waffles. Did I tip for this? Yes I did, just like I did for the room make up service and for any of the other services I used whilst in the USA. Did I have to? No, but then this is a culture in which wages are low and are subsidised through payment for good service. If you think the service for the breakfast is not worth tipping, then don't tip. But I felt it was pretty good value all up and service was always with a smile.

All up this hotel gave good value for money in a clean environment which was located close to excellent transport facilities. If you want the Hilton, go stay at the Hilton (and pay their prices). If you want decent accommodation for reasonable money, then I think you'll find this place fits the bill.","Courtyard rooms on upper floors are apparently quieter.

CajMac22,1,,2013-01-31,COUPLES,2013-01-29,5,Couldn't have asked for more! Excellent!!!!,"Enjoyed our stay at the Hollywood Hotel!
The staff were extremely helpful and courteous.
We were assisted by Cecile who helped in our reservation and made our stay run smoothly. In addition she pretty much planned our entire stay in LA! She was extremely polite, caring and very helpful.
Cecile helped us with booking the majority of our itinerary in LA, organizing our Hollywood Day Tour, Universal Studios and Disneyland trip as well as assisting us with a shuttle for the trip home. We were so blessed!!! Thank You!

The location of the hotel is conveniently located near the Metro which made travel a breeze. Even though the area can look sketchy at night, the hotel gives it a classy edge! The rates were great for our budget and what was a plus was the included buffet breakfast every morning. 
My girlfriend and I loved the omelette bar and the waffles and cereal!!!
The room was always spotless and tidy and whenever we came back from a day out and the outside view of our room was the beautiful courtyard.
A big plus was the fitness room which I used every morning!
I loved the views from the balcony which overlooked the the mountains and we also liked the gift shop which helped us buy last minute presents for home!

Overall we couldn't have asked for anything else! We would definitely recommend staying at the hotel and cannot wait till our next visit to LA.",Room with view of the courtyard =),5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-27,"Dear Guest,

doc d,3002,,2013-01-31,BUSINESS,2013-01-28,4,Good price for the location,"Location
Hotel is located about 30 minute drive from LAX, and around 5-10 drive from Chinese Theatre. There's a metro stop close by. Some shops, and restaurants near the metro. Despite what other reviewers say, the area is fine and did not find it at all dodgy even at night, but as its east Hollywood it all seems a bit sketchy first impressions.
Room
The room was adequate overall it was on the ground floor facing the road, but was quiet. It looked a little dated with old furnishings but was clean, TV worked well and the bed was large, quite high but slept comfortably. The bathroom was also dated but amenities were adequate. The water did not seem that hot though, ok for a shower but not for a bath. 
Facilities
The hotel has a restaurant in the basement, it has quite nice decor but TV's are on. Only used it for breakfast in which there was plenty of options overall. There is an egg station and overall thought the breakfast was ok (stayed in many hotels in the US where the breakfast is just cereal and bread). There is a swimming pool but didn't see it. They have a large car park which is secure with security and gates, it unfortunately cost $20 a day but am told this is standard in LA. At least I felt the car was very secure. WIFI is free though and works very well. 
Staff
Staff overall were very nice, especially the reception lady whom helped me understand the controls on my hired mustang. Check-in and check out was smooth. Staff at breakfast and cleaning also are nice and say hi. 
Bear in mind there is a $100 deposit even though there is no mini bar, apparently for movies etc..
Overall the hotel was perfect for sightseeing in the Hollywood area and was reasonable for one night. Room was ok but breakfast & staff were nice. Paying for parking was annoying but WIFI was free, comparing to other hotels in the area in which are double the price I would happily come back here.",,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-30,"Dear Guest,

YasmineNassar,50,"Cairo, Egypt",2013-01-31,COUPLES,2013-01-25,4,Excellent value for money,"Hotel is a 2 minutes walk from the Metro Station which was very convenient. Neighborhood is a bit sketchy at night, but so is most of Hollywood! Room is comfortable if you dont mind squeaky beds. There is a bus stop just outside the hotel (204). It was helpful when we needed to get to Beverly Center (although you have to get off and change to another bus to get there). A 99c store is nearby, as well as a Rite Aid pharmacy, and lots of nice eateries including a Wendy's restaurant. Front Desk staff helped us receive several packages and kept them safe until we got back. Breakfast is great with waffles, cereals, and eggs prepared to your own taste (spanish omelette, plain omelets, scrambled eggs, and even egg whites). It will keep you full most of the day. We also rented a car from the car rental desk in the hotel's lobby, it was very convenient but a bit pricey (USD 100/day for a Chrysler Convertible). Hotel has a parking lot but at a rate of USD 20/night, we preferred parking on the street (in Lexington Avenue you can find some spots with no parking meters). Check out was at 11AM and our flight was late in the evening so we kept our luggage stored in a closet by the front desk which was very nice. There is a small gift shop near the parking door and several vending machines in each floor. Only downside is that we had asked for a room with a safe and it was written in the confirmation letter we got from the hotel, but when we arrived there, they told us there rnt any available!",,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-30,"Dear Guest,

Elle H,2,,2013-01-31,SOLO,2013-01-21,5,Excellent for my budget!,"I was nervous when I booked because of all of the mixed reviews, but I figured I would give it a try anyway because it was at a great price, conveniently located near the Metro (which I would need to go everywhere), and it included breakfast. Let me tell you, I was not disappointed--I was impressed!

The hotel is small and very lovely--well kept, and you can tell that they have been renovating and improving. It is NOT super glitzy or fancy--which was exactly what I wanted. I wasn't shelling out the dough to come to LA to stay holed up at my hotel, although I could have with how comfortable I was at the hotel! 

Let's start with the beginning. I arrived almost at midnight, super frazzled after a crazy flight and problems with my bank. They gentleman at the front desk was incredibly kind, checked me in and cheered me up, and I was in bed less than 20 minutes after my arrival. The room itself was cozy and very cute, and the bed was HEAVENLY. I love that they have individual temperature controls PLUS a space heater in the room (which came in handy my last night!). I also really appreciated having the fridge and the microwave, since I could bring my delicious leftovers back with me and eat them later. The coffee that is in the room is actually really good, and all of the shower/bath stuff smelled amazing and was actually really good to my hair. 

The place was super clean, and the housekeeping staff did an incredible job of keeping my room extra clean and well-stocked--and super quickly! At one point, I went to the Payless down the street to get flip flops and a smaller purse... I must've been gone for a half hour at the most... and the room had already been cleaned when I came back. The WiFi was very great quality (I even played World of Warcraft on it), and the tech support was very helpful when I inadvertently got myself blacklisted from the network. The staff was unfailingly helpful and kind whenever I had a question--and I had a LOT of them! Most of the staff is bilingual in Spanish as well, so it was nice to be able to switch whenever conversing. :)

And the breakfast. Ohhhh, the breakfast. I have been at five-star hotels where the continental breakfast is coffee, a couple of muffins, and some fruit--but this place has eggs made to order (even egg whites if you're trying to stay healthy), and some incredible waffles! Also granola and yogurt and cheese! There's also an awesome gym in here, the pool is gorgeous, the courtyard as well (and very relaxing!), and I really felt safe and appreciated when I was here. The nearby area is WAY less sketchy than downtown LA and it's actually a lot like Rogers Park in Chicago (looks way sketchier than it is), so I felt very much at home! 

Also, I'm writing this review while sitting in their lobby after check out, still using their awesome Internet to take care of my work stuff, and about to leave my bags here for a while so I can head out and explore during my last couple of hours! If anything, the only thing I could complain about is that the microwave was too powerful and I burnt a breadstick my third night here... I think the staff will be laughing about that for a while!","If you are a light sleeper, try to request a room facing the courtyard rather than the street! I have always lived near the El in Chicago, so I enjoyed the street noise of my room--it lulled me to sleep!",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-27,"Dear Guest,

Jacki M,9,,2013-01-31,COUPLES,2013-01-19,5,"Wow, Just Wow!!","My boyfriend and I were in L.A. for a day to attend a taping of Let's Make A Deal and needed a hotel near the Sunset Bronson Studios.  I found this hotel and thought what a cute hotel so I booked it.  I got a fabulous rate AND a hot breakfast came with it!!  Where do I start with the praises??  Darren and I arrived at the hotel at 4am and we were checked in without any fuss or muss and in bed with a 1/2 hour.  We were in room 231 and it was very nice but the bed was heaven!  It was so comfortable!  I loved the pillows, they were so soft and squishy!  The little refrigerator and microwave were great and really handy!  While there wasn't a bath tub in the bathroom I really didn't miss it since I prefer showers anyway.  I am kind of picky about cleanliness and every thing was spotless.  Our room faced inward and we had a view of the pretty courtyard below.  It was very quiet and extremely relaxing to hear the quiet sound of the fountain water in the courtyard.  After we woke up we decided that breakfast and coffee was a must.  We went downstairs and to say I was happy to see the wonderful array of food was an understatement!  I was literally dancing in happiness!  There was a nice choice of cereals and granolas.  There was a table where 2 really nice employees made cooked to order eggs, scrambled, omelets with a ton of different ingrediants available, over easy, whatever you wanted.  Even egg whites.  They had sausage as well.  They also had fresh, made to order mini waffles that were delicious!  There was also fresh fruit, yogurt, a cheese board, and a big selection of bagels, breads, english muffins, pastries and condiments to go with it all.  Of course there was coffee and tea.  The breakfast and coffee hit the spot and more than filled us up.  We had inadvertantly put a do not disturb sign out instead of fipping it over for maid service so the maid didnt clean our room but that was our fault, certainly not the maids.  When we got back to the room and realized what we had done, Darren poked his head in the hallway and saw the maid down the way.  When we explained what we did they were so nice and sweet even tho it was too late to have our room cleaned.  They gave us towels and amenities and were so sweet and apologized so many times even tho it was not their fault.  On our way out of the hotel to head home we stopped in the little gift shop on the first floor to buy a baseball hat I wanted.  The guy manning the register was so helpful and nice that it was hard for me to believe that anyone ever had a negative thing to say about this hotel!  He took out a map and gave us directions to 2 different spots we wanted to go to and then gave us the map!  I can not begin to say how much we were impressed by the service from everyone, from the front desk clerks, maids, and to the gift shop guy.  We will definitely be coming back and I will personally recommend this hotel with the highest praise I can give.  The hotel is small but it is well kept, pretty and the customer  service is overwhelming to say the least!",Ask for a room facing the courtyard since it is quiet and there is a shared balcony that you an sit on.,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-27,"Dear Guest,

MsFirstClass,16,"Sydney, Australia",2012-11-30,COUPLES,2013-01-19,1,Should Have Gone Elsewhere,"Where do I start?

Hollywood Hotel has no ""Hollywood"" glam in it whatsoever.
You have to pay for parking if you want to park in the hotel lot, tip: if you HAVE to stay here, park around the corner..its free!

The bed smelled terrible, like they'd been slept in and not washed. Weird uncomfortable shaped pillows, I was itchy and we both had rashes on us in the morning, which meant there were probably bed bugs.

The air conditioner sounded like a freight train and couldnt be used from the noise it made.

The hot water was lukewarm to cold, was told to leave it on for 5 mins according to ""maintenance""- If someone complains, you get someone to come up and look into it!

The microwave was unclean and we had to clean it in the sink.

The worst part to me was we put ""Do not Disturb"" on our door,left for the day and came back to see someone had come in and gone against our request, a HUGE 'No no' in the hotel business!

The only thing we did like was the toileteries provided, something that worked!

This place needs an overhaul, cleaning staff need to be trained how to clean and the parking lot, just let people park there, they've already paid to stay!

Bottom line: If a room is not working the way it should, move the guest!",,3.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,hollywoodhotel,General Manager,2013-01-19,"Dear MsFirstClass

Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your stay with us. We value your business and we know you had many hotels to choose from. You have covered all aspects of your stay and we are particularly appreciative of your comments that you liked our bath toiletries and about our great location, good rooms and the overall good value you received... yet you gave us the lowest score one could possible give.... and yes ... it hurts.

Yes, you are right we are not a 5 Star hotel but a small independently owned family run hotel which is usually to our guests benefit as we are able to respond more quickly to guests needs. We are a Hollywood Classic and have been around a long time.  It is important for Tripadvisor readers to have a pretty good idea of what to expect when they are evaluating hotels in the Hollywood area.  We are a small hotel with an inner courtyard.  Most of our rooms have a balcony and all rooms have a refrigerator, microwave, hairdryer, flat screen TV and soon all channels will be 100% HD, Sealy Posturepedic Beds with a pillow top mattress for extra comfort.  All beds have 300 thread count snow white bed linens with a Duvet comforter. Linens are changed and washed daily.  We serve a complimentary hot buffet breakfast with cooked to order omelettes in our restaurant from 6:30am - 10:30am.  Families love us and kids stay and eat free too!

Please accept my apologies for the inconvenience for the noisy air conditioner fan and the lukewarm water.  We have taken note of your positive and negative comments and will use these to monitor and improve the quality of services we offer to our guests.

We do offer a FREE PARKING AND MORE coupon for Tripadvisor members. If you look at the top of our Tripadvisor listing you will see it. The coupon states:
""Present this unexpired coupon at check-in. Not valid with other discounts or promotions. Free parking is for 1 vehicle for the length of the paid stay. No substitutions. Non-Refundable. Valid only if booked direct on official hotel website.""

We also offer a comprehensive answer to the frequently asked question: ""Is There Free Street Parking Around the Hotel?"" on our website which states...... Parking on almost any street overnight in Los Angeles will undoubtedly cost you more if you get a parking citation than parking in the hotel's gated lot. Almost every hotel in Los Angeles charges more than $25 plus 10% tax per night for parking. The Hollywood Hotel only charges $20 plus 10% tax. You can park in the residential side streets around the hotel without a permit and for the most park without time restrictions unless it's a street cleaning day. Carefully read the posted city signs otherwise you will get a citation if you don't move your Car on those days or during the no parking time frame. There will be somewhat of a walk to and from the hotel and your car, plus it will be unpredictable to even find a space as many of the residents park on the street as well. All the other street parking around the hotel is metered and good for a few hours before you have to reload the meter. If you oversleep and don't reload the meter, you might get a citation too. The hotel lot is gated and manned 24 hours by an attendant and is probably one of the prettiest landscaped parking lots in the city and very easy access to and from the hotel.

The buffet breakfast was okay, nothing to brag about, the earlier you get in for breakfast, the better, as it would appear it is not restocked after about 9am. Eggs are cooked fresh which was nice.
The bed was a little small in our room, and the toilet made an awful noise when it was refilling and seemed to take a long time, to the point where I thought it was broken. Room was located at the rear of the hotel and road noise could be heard. 
Guest laundry okay but only two machines, the gift shop and reception declined to change our small notes to quarters to use the machines, and there was no coin machine to make the exchange ourselves.

Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your stay with us. We value your business and we know you had many hotels to choose from. You have covered all aspects of your stay and we are particularly appreciative of your comments about our great location, sleep quality, good service and cleanliness. 

It is always hugely motivating when one takes the time and trouble to acknowledge how one made their booking. Please accept my apologies for the inconvenience Priceline may have caused booking your room type with only one queen bed.  Bidding on ""secret"" hotels in the ""Name Your Own Price"" section finds a hotel in an area you selected which matches your bid price.  These rooms are run of the house rooms and cannot be specified when making your bid and applies to all hotels in the Name Your Own Price section. If you require specific bed types, then I recommend using the Pick Your Hotel section of their site which displays all room types available for each hotel. You may pay a little more, but there will be no surprises at check in.

We have taken note of your positive and negative comments and will use these to monitor and improve the quality of services we offer to our guests.

We hope to serve you again soon.

Lisa W,12,"Hervey Bay, Australia",2012-12-31,FAMILY,2012-12-20,4,Good value for money,"We stayed here for 2 nights in early December 2012 as a family of four, my daughters are 8 & 11. The area is typical Hollywood quite dirty, with most shops having roller doors etc. The hotel is clean, the room was quite large with two large beds but still room to walk around. The room had a fridge and microwave which is unusual for the US. We received breakfast in our rate which was of a good standard, it had cereals, toast, pastries and egg & waffle station also. The property had vending machines and a small convenience store, however, the gas station on the corner had everything you would need.  As Los Angeles is spread out you need to be able to get around and that's when this hotel is great, just down the corner is a metro station (Santa Monica & vermont). Which is part of the red line, approx. 4 stops north and we hit Hollywood & highland which is right near the chinese theatre and movie star homes.  A couple of extra stops north and you hit Universal city, hop off walk to the bus stop and a free shuttle picks you up for a 2 minute ride up the hill to Universal studios and city walk.  We also went to a Lakers game at the staples centre and used the metro to get there, red line to 7th & metro, change trains and then blue line to Pico and across the road to the stadium. It was all very easy and we felt safe.  We ate at the 50's diner approx. 600 meters from the hotel which was good.

The area surrounding the hotel at first looks a little sketchy, however looks can be decieving, especially if you're not familiar with LA. This hotel is great. It has a gated parking lot, a secluded beautiful pool, and a very nice breakfat buffet. The rooms were small, but very nice. The area is more than I could hope for. It's very close to hiking trails in the Hills, great authentic restaurants, area attractions, and even the subway if you chooce not to drive downtown. We booked this hotel because it was close to a friend, but we definately return for the reasons I listed above. It has some real beauty within it's lower level, the back fountains and pool, and the mid atrium is secluded and relaxing.

This is a hotel that is past its prime. The rooms are ugly, 80s decor and the furnishings are old and neglected. There are scuffs and stains all over the walls; I found an old tea bag in the corner under a big splatter mark (obviously a previous occupant attempting to throw it in the garbage) which went unnoticed by housekeeping. 

The room had a dorm fridge (which froze my salad) with an old microwave stacked on top of it haphazardly. There was also a space heater, which we didn't need to use. In our room there was a constant, loud hum of machinery operating. When I called to request a room change because I couldn't sleep with the annoyance, they were unable to do it unless I switched to a room next to the elevator or behind the front desk, which would have been louder. 

The rooms have (weirdly) shared balconies that overlook a little-used courtyard. There are no screens on the sliding doors, nor chairs to sit on the balcony. The courtyard looks nice and has a fountain, but you can hear anyone down there talking from your room. We were on 3rd floor. The shower water would not get past luke warm-- though they did send a maintenance person to fix it fairly quickly. The internet was problematic and I had to call tech support. The breakfast was mediocre and I was surprised that they couldn't even offer a working toaster. Every time I walked by the front desk, I overhead other guests complaining or asking for a room change. (One guy, for the 3rd time!) 

The good: the day-to-day room cleaning was good and the bed was comfortable. There was nice new laminate faux-wood flooring in the room-- yay! no gross carpet! It seems that the hotel is undergoing some renovations, by the sound of the construction and workers. The staff were polite, but unable to attend to guests needs because of the rotten condition of the hotel.

The picture that is shown is false advertisement as it is actually the back of the hotel. My first night of sleep I woke up in the middle of the night itching like a maniac. My shower didnt drain so that was a major issue as well. I reported it to the front desk and they allegedly sent someone to check my room and bed but didnt move me. Ive never experience bed bugs so I thought maybe I had an allergic reaction to something. The next nite, same thing and I reported it again. They didnt want to move me but I insisted because I showed them the bites on my ankles. They finally moved me. I returned home only to learn I packed bed bugs with me back from this hotel. Parking fees were ridiculous too!",DONT just look at the &quot;Hollywood&quot; picture. It&#39;s really HollyHOOD!,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,hollywoodhotel,General Manager,2013-01-24,"Dear AttyB

Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your stay with us. We value your business and we know you had many hotels to choose from. 

You have covered all aspects of your stay and we are particularly appreciative of your comments that you liked our great location. We have many different pictures of the hotel posted on our website and on other websites such as Tripadvisor.  If you are referring to the main display picture for our listing on Tripadvisor, it is the one of our courtyard which is actually located in the center of the hotel.  Many other Tripadvisor members have taken pictures and posted pictures of the courtyard as well. 

Please accept my apologies for the inconvenience for the shower drain. Our maintenance department has taken note and will use it to monitor and improve the quality of all the drains in the hotel.

We are passionate about the safety and comfort of all our guests.  The hotel’s  reputation and future business would be devastated if we failed to maintain a clean, safe and comfortable environment for our guests. We do know many hotels in Los Angeles and throughout the world have had problems with bed bugs and Hollywood Hotel is not one of them. Our management and Housekeeping staff are both trained and educated in detecting the signs of bed bugs and vigilant in our practices in keeping the hotel free of all pests. 

Some of our practices include thorough inspections of ALL rooms at least once a month by completely dismantling and inspecting every nook and cranny of every bed frame, mattress, box spring, pillow top mattress, bed skirt, headboard, nightstand, desk, chair, and sofa in the room.  We also inspect all base wood, drapes and rods. We also take preventative measures by installing mattress and box spring protective envelope covers, so should a pest make its way into a bed, it will be blocked from hiding in the pipe edging or in any seam of any mattress.  The protective mattress covers also protect our mattresses from accidental spills or fluids and can be easily changed in a moment’s notice by our housekeeping staff.  Pests also like to hide in wall to wall carpeting which is another reason ALL of our rooms either have wood or tile flooring.  Wood and/or tile flooring is also a much cleaner surface and does not attract odors giving our rooms a cleaner, fresher smell than most other hotels which our guests appreciate.  

We also fumigate all rooms and a monthly rotation, however pesticide is only effective on common pests which ingest external food like ants and roaches. Bed bugs are the exception since they are parasitic insects of the cimid family which feed exclusively on blood, rendering any pesticide ineffective. The only effective solution for bed bugs is heat remediation which involves placing a heat machine in the guest room and heating the room to between 120-130 degrees for up to 8 hours. Bed bugs have a low heat tolerance of 113 degrees when exposed for 1 hour before they terminate.  Heat remediation is the method we use and is the most effective, non evasive and green solution.  

If a guest informs us they believe their room has bed bugs, we take these claims seriously and our policy is to move the guest to another room immediately, then do a thorough inspection followed up with a heat remediation treatment for at least 8 hours.  In the past 3 months there has been no evidence of bed bugs in any of our rooms.  Furthermore, there have been no other guests before or since this review was written to have had any similar complaints and there is ample documentation confirming bed bug bites are often misdiagnosed.

We go through considerable expense monthly to ensure our rooms are pest free in order to maintain the reputation of the hotel as we care deeply about the health, comfort and satisfaction with the services of the hotel for all of our guests.

We do offer a FREE PARKING AND MORE coupon for Tripadvisor members. If you look at the top of our Tripadvisor listing you will see it. The coupon states:
""Present this unexpired coupon at check-in. Not valid with other discounts or promotions. Free parking is for 1 vehicle for the length of the paid stay. No substitutions. Non-Refundable. Valid only if booked direct on official hotel website.""

We also offer a comprehensive answer to the frequently asked question: ""Is There Free Street Parking Around the Hotel?"" on our website which states...... Parking on almost any street overnight in Los Angeles will undoubtedly cost you more if you get a parking citation than parking in the hotel's gated lot. Almost every hotel in Los Angeles charges more than $25 plus 10% tax per night for parking. The Hollywood Hotel only charges $20 plus 10% tax. You can park in the residential side streets around the hotel without a permit and for the most park without time restrictions unless it's a street cleaning day. Carefully read the posted city signs otherwise you will get a citation if you don't move your Car on those days or during the no parking time frame. There will be somewhat of a walk to and from the hotel and your car, plus it will be unpredictable to even find a space as many of the residents park on the street as well. All the other street parking around the hotel is metered and good for a few hours before you have to reload the meter. If you oversleep and don't reload the meter, you might get a citation too. The hotel lot is gated and manned 24 hours by an attendant and is probably one of the prettiest landscaped parking lots in the city and very easy access to and from the hotel.

We have taken note of your positive and negative comments and will use these to monitor and improve the quality of services we offer to our guests.

 If you have any additional questions, please do not hesitate to contact me at jeff@hollywoodhotel.net.

We had never visited America before and had no idea about parking laws, as a citizen himself i think he should have been a little more helpful.  I should have looked into the additional hotel charges before i booked but i never though it would cost so much to park there.   

The hotel is clean enough, the door as you walk in says the hotel is 4* however there is no way that i would give the hotel any more than 3*, i would probably say it's a good 2* hotel.  Our room was large, the furniture was a little dated and a bit shabby as was the bathroom there was also a large tear in the curtain which looked unsightly.  The walls are thin and so you can hear a lot of noise from the corridors etc.  Breakfast was very good, we stayed here for 8 nights though and the menu does not change so it got a little boring, the food was good quality.  Vermont Street where the hotel is located is ok, i would not advise walking alone round here at night as there are a lot of homeless and shady looking people lurking about.

I'm glad you found our breakfast buffet good quality.  We do alter a few items on a daily basis, however we must keep the standards as guests have different tastes and wants on different days.  Our selection is plentiful and guests have the option to chose a different breakfast meal daily for upto a 30 day stay if they wish.

Sorry, about the tear in the curtain. I wish you had informed usabout it  during your 8 day stay as we would have taking care of it right away.

Again, thank you so much for writing a review which allows me the opportunity to inform future guests about parking fees and our breakfast items.

Kelly T,5,"Melbourne, Australia",2012-11-30,SOLO,2012-11-21,4,Decent for the price,"Stayed 4 nights in queen room, booked through ticketsatwork with discount rate.  For that I paid for, I was happy with the quality and service, but if you're paying full price probably not worth it.

Location:
I didn't drive, so the proximite of the hotel to public transport is definitely a plus.  Subway shut down on arrial so I had to taxi in, but I hauled 70 lbs of bags to airport without major issues.  (Redline to union, then flyaway shuttle).  About 5 min walk to santa monica station and it has elevators so managable with bags.

Apart from the Redline, which is very easy to get around downtown, hollywood blvd or universal studios, the location is also well served by buses on Vermont, Sunset Blvd, and Santa Monica.  There's also a shuttle to Griffith Observatory on Vermont/Susnet, so for tourist destinations it's defintely a plus.  I took the sunset bus (and back) to Getty Center one day and the Santa Monica bus to santa monica the next.  Expect a fairly slow/long ride (80-90 mins each), but cheap ($1.50) and an interesting way of seeing the city if you don't mind it getting packed and the diversity of characters on the bus (some aggressive characters and homeless).

It's a fairly quick drive to/from downtown if there's no traffic and getting to hollywood is no issue by car.

There's fairly good dining choices with fast food/ budget meals within 5-15 mins walk, and most would probably deliver.  Rafellos's (Italian) nearby is a good bet (you get free salad and garlic bread with pasta).  Supermarkets are not too far if you wanna stock up on fruits/snacks.  I wouldn't say the area is particularly dangerous at night to/from bus stations and subway as a solo traveller (male).  Vermont itself is fine but don't go too far off Vermont especially at night.

Staff:
Phone call experience to hotel was average, service was basic, courtesy was lacking.  Check in expereince probably varies from staff to staff, but the 3 members I interacted with were all helpful and welcoming.  Breakfast staff are ok if you don't expect to be treated like royalty.

Cleanliness and amenities:
Hotel itself is well kept with the patio and facilities as others described.  For the room itself it's ok.  Amenities include a bar fridge and microwave which are nice.  A coffee maker and coffee (good for coffee drinkers but bad if you don't like me), tea bags, flat screen TV.  I have found hair and not too pleasant stains on both the bed cover and towels (some, not all), so definitely inspect before use and bring your own if in doubt.  At least the sheets and pillowcases themselves look to be clean.  The toilet is small and the flush is one of the weakest ever and you need 2-3 flushes on average.  It's managable, and there's even a note for you to flush while using but annoying still.  Shower is ok.  Noisewise I had a room facing courtyard so it's ok.  You can hear guest in courtyard if they're loud, but was faily quiet across the 4 nights I was there.  The aircon is fairly loud and sometimes there's a banging noise.  I got used to it and slept fine, but if you're sensitive to sounds bring earplugs.  Room has complimentary internet which was great and was easy to setup and use.

Breakfast has selection of cereals, bagels/muffins/toast, eggs (2 per person)/ order omelette and waffles.  Juice is watered down but they always do with ice etc.  It's free so enjoy it and it's reasonable quality and fills you up.  Service is ok.  Elevator is slow so I used the stairs most of the time.  Just don't lock yourself in!

Overall you get what you pay for, and for what I pay it met my expectations.  Location is good for its class as is service and amenities.",,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-30,"Dear Guest,

Staff were not friendly at all, and not very helpfull. Our room was on the first floor, close to entrance and the elevator.. We were awake really early in them morning, as it was very loud outside of the room, people talking in the reception area, by the elevator. I asked at the reception if they had any other room available. The guy was not friendly, and told me that were no rooms available and our room was one of the quiet room in the bulding!!!!! I can not imagine the other rooms then!!! I was really surprise by his lack of customer service. The room was old,smells weird,  the ac makes really loud noises, and the shower is not very high, if you are not short,  you will find challenging taking a shower. Breakfast was ok. Overall our experience was not good! I owuld not recommend this hotel to anybody. If you are planning your trip to LA, I would recommed to save some more money and stay at a better hotel!",,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,hollywoodhotel,General Manager,2013-01-28,"Dear Juliana S

Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your stay with us. We value your business and we know you had many hotels to choose from. You have covered all aspects of your stay and we are particularly appreciative of your comments that you liked our breakfast.

Thank you for taking the time and trouble to acknowledge the staff concerned and I apologize for their lack of service of not being able to change your room location. Due to high occupancy, we are usually only able to change rooms for guests from about 11am to 3pm, which is when our housekeeping staff can clean the checked out rooms and have them ready for the next guest. For some reason you had to leave earlier than 11am and were away during the time frame and could not wait to switch rooms.

Please accept my apologies for the inconvenience of some of our A/C equipment, the noise outside your room and the height of the shower head.

We have taken note of your positive and negative comments and will use these to monitor and improve the quality of services we offer to our guests.

We hope to serve you again soon.

JackNLondon,73,,2012-07-31,FRIENDS,2012-11-10,4,"Good hotel, nice breakfast, location not too bad!","I stayed here for 5 nights with friends and we had an enjoyable stay!

Service:
The reception staff were reasonably friendly and polite and did their job. The maids were also very polite and explained to us where to go for breakfast, etc. when they saw us walking around unsure. Always said good morning with a genuine smile. The cooking staff at breakfast were also nice.

Value:
We got a special deal on ebookers and paid a lot less than I've seen this hotel go for previously so were pleased in terms of value. Actually a really nice hotel for what we paid!

Sleep quality:
We stayed in a room with 2 double beds (there were 4 of us) and the beds were large enough so that 2 people sharing wasn't cramped.

Cleanliness:
Rooms were cleaned daily and the breakfast room and lobby all seemed rather clean. 

Location:
What everyone always talks about regarding this hotel. The location is not as dangerous as people have previously made it out to be. By this I mean if you are from any large, westernised city you will have seen a homeless person before or a dodgy looking person walk past you who smells of alcohol. Coming from London this was not a big deal for me. 
In terms of proximity to attractions, we were using public transport whilst in LA and so this hotel was in an ideal location for us - a few minutes walk down the road from a metro station which was perfect for going to Downtown and Hollywood (the hotel is halfway between the two). 
Also from there you can take a few different buses, one of which goes to Santa Monica (as the metro doesn't yet reach in that direction).

Breakfast:
The breakfast that was included in the price of the room was delicious. Ranging from on-the-spot eggs (cooked however you like them - scrambled, omelette, etc.) to sausages, waffles, cereal, toast, various juices, coffee - the works! Set us up well for a day of sightseeing around the urban sprawl that is Los Angeles.

Overall, I would recommend this hotel (if you have been wrapped in cotton wool your whole life and so are overly sensitive to seeing a homeless person or dodgy looking people, then don't stay here, otherwise it's fine)!",,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-30,"Dear Guest,

The hotel kind of reminds me of a resort I stayed at in Puerto Vallarta, but a tiny version with no ocean nearby.

Pros: Good price, clean rooms, free and pretty good breakfast buffet, good location (about 10 minutes drive from the Hollywood Walk of Fame with no traffic)

Cons: The walls are a little thin, tiny bathroom (but then it's 2 girls staying in the room and we need a lot of counter space), expensive parking.

Hotel staff were so so. The cleaners were very sweet ladies and the front staff, some of them were awesome, and some of them condescending. We had one big complaint but the manager on duty (Roman) was able to help us out and we were happy with his customer service.

Emmensen,5,"Los Angeles, California",2012-10-31,COUPLES,2012-10-31,1,Staff is a nightmare,"Let's start with the positive things about the hotel:
It's a really pretty building and conveys some of the typical Hollywood flair. The breakfast is AMAZING, a lot of variety, and the staff in the breakfast room was very polite and nice, preparing delicious omelets and waffles. However, I usually do not book hotels for good breakfast, but for service and a great room to stay. Unfortunately, both is not to be found at the Hollywood Hotel.

The rest, quite frankly, makes this hotel not worth the money. Not at all.
The concierges at the front desk are not only unhelpful, they are rude, impolite and unapologetic. Words like ""sorry"" or ""apologies"" do simply not come to their mind!
Example 1) Having booked the trip through lastminute.com, I had prepaid the trip before online. Upon arrival, at 10pm, after a day of long journey, it took the concierge almost 15 minutes to realize that. He kept insisting I was wrong and I had not prepaid and asked to charge my credit card the fee for two whole nights plus the standard security fee of $100. When he finally discovered that he was wrong (or at least the system) he is using, there were no apologies about this let alone an understanding that this was an awkward and more than inconvenient situation for us.
Example 2) There is no heater in the room, ok. The weekend we stayed there, temperatures went down to the mid 40s in the nights, so the room with the pretty high ceilings and wooden floor got cold and rather uncomfortable. My girlfriend was freezing, so I asked for a heater. At the same time I had discovered that the fridge stopped working and my drinks started to get warm. It was 11pm, there was only one concierge at the front desk, and he said that he couldn't do anything now because no one was around. Apparently, they also don't carry spare blankets or bath robes. Apologies? You would guess, but not at all.
The fridge got eventually fixed the next days. No sign of a heater, but hey, it's California, who needs a heater, when the AC is running?

Is that really the standard for a (better) 3*** hotel?

Parking is also quite pricy (~19/night), but at least is on a safe lot right next to the hotel.

Besides, the sauna was not working, and guess what? No apologies about that once more. At least I was told I will be called when it works again. I am still waiting for that call today. The bus stop right in front of the room added to the already very loud traffic from Vermont Ave.

Will not go there again, and I highly recommend staying in another place in Hollywood.",,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-10-12,"Dear Oemmesen...

My cards are fine but when I asked the dispassionate clerk why i wasn't notified so that I could rectify the issue, he said that wasn't their policy, that if the card is invalid they just automatically cancel.

There is also a supermarket very close for anything you might need.

Relatively quiet area and very close to the Metro and the bus stops. Area isn't too bad, no real trouble that I noticed but we weren't out after 8pm at night.

Good selection at breakfast with eggs and waffles made to order, also cereal, drinks and bagles, pastries etc. More than enough to get you going for the day and saved us the hassle of somewhere to eat.

Great value considering where it is - only 15 minutes away from Hollywood on the train - and would stay again if I was going to LA. Only reason the sleep quality is so low is because I struggle badly with jet lag!",,4.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-30,"Dear Guest,

Kim E,53,"Copenhagen, Denmark",2012-10-31,SOLO,2012-10-22,4,Nice hotel with very friendly staff,"I chose the hotel because it was between two metro stations (Red line) so it is very central. The neighborhood is a little worn down but for the 6 days I stayed there I did not experience any problems. One block away south there is a small shopping center and 3-4 blocks north there is a bigger shopping center. 
When I arrived  a very helpful and friendly young lady checked me in and I got a room on the ground floor facing the nice courtyard. 
The room was quite big, had a queen size bed, refrigerator, microwave, 32"" flat screen and a complimentary free wi-fi. The wi-fi was not very fast but quite stable and good. The TV channels were plenty and in a good quality. The only minor disapointment was the coffemaker which could only make one cup of coffee at a time and only use some very special coffee filters.
The bathroom was nice and big and everything was very clean.
The aircondition in the room seemed to be quite difficult to control - either it was very cold or warm. I could not set it at a steady temperature but ended up switching it off and on manually.
The breakfast room is downstairs and is quite nice. There is a section where some very friendly chefs will make you omelets, eggs and waffles. Otherwise a nice selection of bread, juice, cereals etc. And the coffee was surprisingly good.
There is also a computer in the lobby that may be used free of charge There is no printer but I asked one of the staff and he told me just to mail it to the hotel, and they would print it (no charge).
In general all the staff I encountered were very friendly and helpsome.
I will definitely recommend this hotel  for anyone going to LA and in particular want to be close to public transportation.",,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-30,"Dear Guest,

Tipsy traveller,49,"Birmingham, United Kingdom",2012-10-31,BUSINESS,2012-10-05,2,"Out of date, smelly, cheap, small. Cute pool, staff average","On arrival I thought it was a retro Art Deco hotel but quickly realised it just hasn't been modernised. 

It was clean although the hall to level 2 where we were absolutely stank, a kind of weird old musky smell. The room equally stank but you quickly don't notice it.

The room is clean, good shower room. The balcony is overlooked by everybody in a tiny courtyard so you can't sunbathe and also you hear everybody's phone calls etc really loud.

The fountain in the courtyard is turned on all night long so you can hear it all the time.

The bed sheets looked clean but stank of mens BO. I didn't notice until the first night. I didn't say anything because I was sure they'd be changed but no. This went on the entire holiday, too afraid to complain I put up with the smell.

Breakfast was ok I suppose, nothing groundbreaking, if you don't like eggs you're screwed! The toaster took an age to toast and even then to a poor standard. Literally ten minutes waiting for bread to pop up warm bread.

The staff were mixed. The breakfast staff and cleaners were fab. 
We had amazing directions from one of the receptionists. The other guy who I can only describe as being the human version of Peter Griffin from family guy picked his nose through the entire check in.
He managed to keep a straight face while charging us $90 for a small amount of phone calls due to our mobile being lost at Universal Studios. He also kept a straight face while asking for $65 for a taxi to the airport too.

The check out day is what has made me very angry. We have to check out by 11am and our plane to the UK was 8pm, we were allowed to store our bags and use the pool. So by 3pm when we come to leave we needed showers. We were told no. We were given the use of me washroom only. I asked for a towel and was offered a paper napkin, I explained we had a ten hour flight ahead of us and needed to freshen up, her response was 'only registered guests can use our towels' we had been there a week and funded their pension by this time. They couldn't even loan us a towel!
A final insult is the taxi company they booked to collect us are dishonest.
As the driver pulled out of LAX after dropping us I realised I'd left a wedge of nots in the car- about $60. I called the hotel who called the taxi company. They called back to say he looked but nothing. I misted he come back, over half hour later (where had he been??) he returned and surprise surprise nothing.
Interestingly without any indication from me he got out of the cab and went straight to where I left it and pointed and said 'see- nothing'.
Absolute thief. 
Not happy with the hotel. Once we had checked out they treated us like traps off the street. I won't be going back.",To go elsewhere if possible although the location is on the metro line. The only benefit of this out of date musky place...,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,,,,,53
Niraj Bhagat,150,"Hayes, United Kingdom",2012-09-30,COUPLES,2012-10-05,4,Excellent location & good rooms,"We chose this hotel as a part of our LA tour in Sept 2012 mainly due to it's location. The hotel is situated in the Vermont Ave area, it's <5 mins walk to the Vermont/Santa Monica station, red line. As soon as you get out of the station, the hotel is clearly visible when you look at your left - it's that close. The location is safe overall but like any part of LA, you start seeing homeless after 8pm (including the downtown area) but they don't bother you. From the airport it's a 20 min drive in avg traffic conditions. From the metro, you can get to Hollywood within 10 mins.

The rooms were spacious, we were given a 2 queen bedroom, we used the second one for the luggage :). They were comfortable and we had good nights sleep during our stay. The hotel offers free wifi which is a plus point. This was the first hotel where we had a microwave in our room which we didn't make use of , it's a good thing as it could be very handy. You get a coffee maker, refrigerator as standard. The AC helped us cope with the hot weather of LA. While the rooms look a bit tired, the facilities work perfect.

Staff were ok, they seem to be in hurry most of the times but were good while giving advice on where to go around the city. Breakfast is offered in the morning, for us vegetarians, there was a limited choice - cereals, cakes & tortillas, can't complain as we don't eat much anyways.

Overall, for a city that's called the gang capital of US this hotel was safe. We didn't see anything nasty during our stay at the hotel. I would def recommend this to anyone visiting LA. My only gripe with the hotel is they charge you $20 for parking, we live in a age where most hotels offer parking complimentary.",Choose 2nd floor with views to &#39;Hollywood&#39; sign,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-30,"Dear Guest,

Cherie62,21,"Sacramento, California",2012-09-30,FAMILY,2012-10-01,5,Hollywood Hotel Nice Stay,"Arrived at the hollywood hotel later in the day but called to make sure that was not a problem. The Lady I spoke to was very helpful and assuring that our room would be waiting. We booked on line and requested a king size bed, facing the beautiful inner courtyard above the first floor. We were very happy to get exactly what we asked for & more a corner room!
The room was very nice, large, clean, balcony(balcony shared with next door occupant not private) with great view of the courtyard, all the cosmetics (shampoo, conditioner, lotion, soaps, mouthwash) supplied were quality, from Italy.
The closet space was large and the bathroom nice size.
We stayed five days at the hotel however we spoke to the front desk regarding possible shorter or longer depending on how our grandsons heart surgery went and his recovery after. The Hollywood Hotel Staff were very undrestanding, sympathetic, concerned and worked with us on the length of stay saying ""just let us know what you need"". Every time I came to the front desk I was asked how our grandson was doing. This caring from the staff was quite warming.
We spent alot of time in the hospital but also the remainder of the time was spent in the Hotel, resting, watching TV or on the Ipad, no problem connecting speed good.
Parking is expensive anywhere in LA, we used the parking for a few days but mainly car stayed at CHLA parking as we were there most of the time.
Location is with in four blocks of CHLA, so this was a great location for us to stay. We walked most of the time to the hospital, to restraunts & Ronald McDonald House, where family was staying.
We will stay here again & recommend family and friends to stay at The Hollywood Hotel.","Ask for room above first floor, quite rooms face the innercourtyard.",4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-27,"Dear Guest,

Heather L,21,,2012-09-30,COUPLES,2012-09-29,3,"Nice hotel, fading grandure but cleaning staff is lazy!","This hotel has the makings of a really great hotel!
However, despite meeting rooms that are named after movie stars, a lovely fountain in the back entrance, nice wide hallways and renovated rooms, this hotel falls short. 

I arrived at this hotel very excited because many movie stars have stayed at this hotel in its long history. The hotel still has that feeling of past grandeur, but it needs some money and time spent on it to bring it up to snuff. It also needs a better cleaning staff.

We arrived to our room. Smaller than anticipated, but bright, updated. No bathtub, but we were prepared to live with that until I started to notice hair on the tile floors. It was long, dark, curly hair and it was all over. I called the front desk and complained and was told that housekeeping would clean it well in the morning. I thought that was inadequate, but was tired. So I got into bed... that's when I noticed that the long, curly hair was also in the bed. I called the front desk and was told someone would come to change the bed. No one showed up for 1/2 an hour. My husband went down to the front desk and was ignored until he asked loudly when someone would be coming to our room to deal with the hair in the bed. Then they sent the maintenance man. 

It took almost two hours for the maintenance man to find enough sheets and pillow cases to change my bed. They had no duvet covers available, so we had to do without one for the night. Needless to say that I did not sleep well after all of that.

The manager, Roman, did his best to turn the situation around the next day but upgrading our room to a bigger room with a bathtub. We appreciated that and had no more problems with hair in our room. Roman also did not charge us two nights parking, which was appreciated. However, hot water was an issue.

I had several tepid showers while staying at the Hollywood Hotel. We had a bathtub but not enough hot water to take a bath. In addition, although the hotel had a pool and sauna, the sauna was a two person sauna which needed to be reserved. You could only reserve it for a half hour, even though it was kept off and took almost a half hour to heat up. The pool was cold.

One little note about hotel cleanliness: a dog was on the premises during our stay. This very sweet dog was a 'service' dog - but not really. He was in show business. Anyway, I'm sure he crapped on the floor right around the corner from the dining room where breakfast was served. My husband and I discovered this rather stomach-turning ""accident"" and reported it to the front desk. The next morning, our last, we noticed that though the feces had been removed from the tile floor, the smears were still very much in evidence. Again, not the most energetic or interested housekeeping staff. We did not bother to mention this one to the front desk. 

Front desk staff were not the most responsive. I have stayed in many hotels over the years, both for pleasure and business, and have not met staff quite so unhelpful. 

In all, our stay at The Hollywood Hotel - much anticipated by me - was a disappointment. It is too bad because this hotel has the fundamentals of a really nice hotel. The price is very good, but they could charge so much more if they spent some money upgrading and restoring this hotel to its former beauty and lushness. And put in a pool heater and a hot tub. And totally changed up their housekeeping staff and most of the front desk staff....","Check your rooms for cleanliness, especially your beds. If you have a problem the manager, Roman, is a reasonable individual who really makes an effort to fix things as best he can. He appeared a bit beleaguered to me - I think he gets a lot of complaints. Roman, however, was the one truly positive influence in this hotel stay.",4.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,,,,,6
Ma S,3,"Reno, Nevada",2012-09-30,COUPLES,2012-09-29,4,Our Hotel Experience at Hollywood Hotel,"When we first arrived at the hotel we were kind of nervous. We walked into an existing argument between a hotel patron and staff. It got really heated. However we were helped in a professional and friendly manner. The parking was well lit and had ample space. The area where the hotel is situated was safe and in a decent area. We did not encounter any problems whatsoever. The hotel was very close to all the areas we wanted to visit like Beverly Hills, Venice Beach, Santa Monica Beach, Walk of fame etc. So we loved the location. The hotel amenities were great like free ice, sauna, pool, Excellent free breakfast and spectacular views of the city on the balcony's. We stayed on the 3rd floor so it was really quiet. In fact we did not notice any noise throughout the entire hotel during our visit. The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was that the rooms were kind of small.  Beds were very comfortable just like the reviews stated. I have low back issues and slept very good!  We had 2 queen beds but the room could of been larger. The bathrooms were small and it had small closet space for clothes. The WIFI connection was extremely slow. I did not bring my laptop and used the hotels which limits to 15 minutes per guest so I had to hustle to get what I needed done with slow connection. Overall the staff was great except for the (hispanic guy I believe that was his race) cleaning the tables in the restaurant area he was kind of short and rude with us whenever we asked him a question.

I had ants in my room which I discovered at 10:30 at night, the lady at the front desk organized for someone to come sort it out straight away which was good. They also happily changed my notes for coins to use the washing machine and dryer. The bed was super comfy and big! There is not a great deal of things in the area but the bus and red line are close by which you can take to Hollywood, Universal Studios or to the beach.

I was double-charged for my stay and not one person was willing to rectify the situation, I was pushed around from person to person and it was up to me to try and have the problem resolved. It's been days and I still haven't been reimbursed. During check-in, the attendant did not mention any instructions on how to take advantage of the extra amenities paid for when I made my reservation.

Tessa C,202,"Darwin, Australia",2012-09-30,COUPLES,2012-09-20,4,"Great rooms, excellent breakfast","We stayed in the Hollywood Hotel for four nights when we arrived in LA from Australia.  First off, the area is ok - we felt perfectly safe walking along Vermont Avenue, even at 10pm.  I wouldn't have gone down the side streets, but walking to the Rite-Aid and the Metro station was fine.  However, it isn't anywhere near as nice as North Hollywood or Beverly Hills.

The hotel itself was very nice - clean and modern.  I think we stayed in a modern room, as the furniture and floorings were all new.  There is a nice courtyard in the middle of the hotel, where guests can go for a drink or just relax.  

The service was ok - we were able to check in early, however other then that, the staff were not overly helpful.  They try to sell a tour which is obviously affiliated with the hotel, as the man who checked us in was quite pushy.  Also, we didn't have enough quarters to wash our clothes, but when we asked at the front desk, we were told, sorry we haven't got our money run yet.  I think that service is definetly an area that the hotel can work on.

The housekeeping on the other hand was wonderful - they did a great job of cleaning our room each day.  The breakfast was also great - the egg cooks were excellent - best omlettes we have ever eaten.

The only other issue we had was that the rooms directly across the hall were being renovated, which meant we were awoken at 8:00am by constant hammering.  This was for a couple of days - the staff did not advise us that this was happening, or offer us another room.

I would recommend this as a good place to stay - very close to the Metro red line station, and the buses run along the street.  My only complaint was the service and the fact that we were woken up early by the renovations.",Ask for a room overlooking the Courtyard - otherwise your room will overlook the busy Vermont Ave or the carpark at the rear.,4.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-30,"Dear Guest,

capouk75,3,,2012-08-31,COUPLES,2012-09-14,1,DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL!,"We are not picky what we want it is just a clean room, a good night sleep and polite service from the staff, nothing more.
We stayed at this hotel only because we booked it as a “Secret Hotel” using Latminute.com, otherwise we would have never stayed at this hotel considering the bad reviews that you can read on Tripadvisor, and I am sorry but I have to say they deserve every single bad review.
Ok the room was big and clean but that is the only positive thing about this hotel.
We woke up at 7:50 with a very loud noise of drilling and banging coming from the room above ours. They were obviously refurbishing the room and no one at the reception had the courtesy to tell us that when we checked in.
When we told the receptionist she did not even apologise, she did not care a bit and she was quite rude.
Breakfast was below average and the guy cooking the omelette made you feel so uncomfortable that we did not even ask for one.
The location of the hotel is far away from the attractions of Los Angeles and ok there is the tube close by but it’s not the safest area to walk even during the day.
To conclude the bad experience we had with this hotel, they charged my credit card when it has already been charged by lastminute.com
When I called the hotel to explain what happened the hotel receptionist told me that from their records they could see that the reservation was done directly with the hotel. I offered to forward the email reservation from lastminute.com or to give them all the necessary details, the answer was “we cannot help you any further” and the lady on the phone was very rude and could not wait to get off the phone.
So I had to write to Lastminute.com to explain what happened. After a few days I received a reply saying that the hotel manager Roman Baranov agreed to refund the amount charged.

The breakfast also is very good and you have all you need in your room. Really I would have give the maximum rating to it. The only problem was that I booked my room online on their internet site and when I arrived there (at 11pm with two kids) there was not a reservation with my name. So I invited the guy at the reception to have a look on internet on their site to verify that the reservation was there. But he refused to listen to me and he said that there was no reservation and he had a free room that could give to me for 350$ per one night. He was extremely unpolite and he told me that it was not him to have a problem but me, so if I wanted the room I had to pay 350$. I went away and... next day my credit card was charged for ""no show"". Is it unbelievable? Yes, but it is what happened. So I went back the following day to ask for clarification and I found another guy that was very nice and verified on their system what happened.

Rod P,1,"Perth, Australia",2012-07-31,COUPLES,2012-08-10,3,Good and bad,"The rooms were clean, the place was ok. The breakfast selection was a bit average, but the omelets were nice. I don't know about the fruit selection. a few black spoted bananas and some cut up in pieces sitting there for a long period of time.
The carpet in the dinning area were rinkled and could give an old person a real nasty fall.
The day staff were excellent. Very helpful and nice.
The guy at night that organised me a taxi for the next morning ripped me off.
Sounded like he knew the guy personally. $98 to go 36mile. Said that was the going price and there wasn't much cheaper.
I find out the next day it was an express limo.

The area is a little dirty but felt safe there. Black spots of chewing gum remains all over the sidewalks around the area.
The metro rail is close by which was great and an old style milk bar down the road was brilliant.
Great food.

SO not a bad place to stay.",,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,0

Julie B,2,,2012-07-31,COUPLES,2012-07-30,3,"Hollywood Hotel, LA","We stayed two nights in a one bedroom queen off of the courtyard. I loved the location which was walking distance to quaint burros called Los Feliz, Silver Lake and Sunset Junction, Griffith Park and Frank Lloyd Wright's Eniss House.  Griffith Park has lots hiking trails and we were able to hike to the Observatory.  Los Feliz has many restaurants and a nice little wine bar. We found no need to have a car with these attractions being so close. It might have been different had we wanted to see other LA attractions.  

The bedding was nice and comfortable with amazingly soft pillows.
Our room and the hotel were very clean. Our room was very quiet since it faced a courtyard with comfortable seating and a lovely fountain. 

Breakfast was fair. It was nice to have fresh scrabbled eggs each morning and good coffee.

Just a few recommendations for improvement: 

1. Smoking is allowed in the courtyard area and therefore cigar and cigarette smoke wafted into our room.  Due to health concerns regarding second hand smoke, exposure to cigarette smoke should be disclosed when checking into these rooms.

2. We were charged $5.00 by the front desk to call a cab for us. 

3. Add fresh fruit to breakfast options. Only fruit available was canned peaches one morning and canned pears the next day.  

We will stay here again and hopefully the courtyard will be designated a smoke free area before we return.

greensmartie,10,"Calgary, Canada",2012-07-31,FAMILY,2012-07-27,3,"Average, probably won't return","We travel extensively for work and vacation. We aren't picky, but having a hot shower is a must, or at least more warm than cool/cold. We called the front desk in the afternoon and they said the maintenance man would come. He didn't come, so we called again later that night. He came, and said he would need to replace a part the next morning. He didn't come the next morning, so we called again at night. He still didn't come. That's the 2nd day. On the third morning we called again, and then he came. He said it was fixed, but we felt no difference in the temperature. His supervisor came and said this was the legal limit of temperature, there is nothing they could do, and was pretty rude about everything. We have stayed in so many hotels over all these years, and we know the difference between hot and cold. The front desk said they had no other rooms available, even though the parking lot was kind of vacant. In the morning we took 1 min showers because we were shivering. They wouldn't do anything more about it, so we just did the best we could with the cool shower. So with this inconvenience, coupled with the delay in customer service, I'd rate this hotel 2 stars, but since the breakfast was good, it deserves 1 more star.

Pros: Good breakfast, comfortable beds, semi-modern decor, we're happy the A/C was working as it was 33 degrees out!
Cons: Shower was lukewarm at best, not the fastest customer service, stains on the carpet, pictures on the website are showing the backside entrance of the hotel, not the front entrance (which is quite deceiving), parking each day is expensive.  

We won't be returning to this hotel, as we need showers that aren't cold.",,3.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,,,,,15

maribelcuprilldefust,164,"San Juan, Puerto Rico",2012-07-31,FAMILY,2012-07-23,1,nightmare stay,"after a five hour road trip from Las Vegas we arrived at the Hollywood Hotel .We had a prepaid reservation for two rooms.One was ok ,the other did not have a working AC That night the hotel was full so they could not change us .The old man in the front desk was alone and said he could not speak to a supervisor at that moment and couldn't do anything about it  , he offered a fan. My kids had to sleep that night in a hot room . We could not open the balcony doors because ,the hotel area is not a nice neighborhood.The following day they changed us three times because the AC was not working in  those rooms  either. They even got mad at us because they don,t have housekeeping personnel after 3 in the afternoon and my kids used the bathroom while they waited to be changed  to another room, again .I guess they wanted to put somebody else there ,they did not care about the AC situation.  At the end we decided not to spend more time trying to solve this problem because the personnel at front desk was very nasty and I had lost to much time in this matter,The last room's AC was not so great either. Since I was able to see 5 rooms  I can say they are mostly rooms with  old furniture and smelly rugs . There are some remodeled rooms that are better. Its been three days since I checked out  and have not been able to speak on the phone with the manager for the credit they said they would give me for the inconviniences of the first night.Probably never will.There are many alternatives in LA so don't pick this hotel!!!

Tumnie,57,"Nelson, New Zealand",2011-10-31,FRIENDS,2012-06-29,3,"Great Value, Close to Metro Station","We stayed at the Hollywood Hotel in October 2011 and found it to be very good value and a pleasant hotel.  

Check in was a breeze and the staff were very friendly and offered help if we wanted to book shows/tours/transport.
Our room was comfortable, and of a good clean standard.  This is a middle of the road hotel charging reasonable prices and we were happy that our expectations were exceeded given price paid.  Our bed was comfortable and although our room was on the road noise was not an issue for us.

The breakfast, served downstairs in a nice breakast room was extensive and generous  with a good mixture of cooked and uncooked items.  Breakfast was included in the price we paid for our room and was much nicer than we've been presented with for expensive prices at more 'luxury' hotels around the world.

Having done our research we were aware the hotel was away from the bright lights of Hollywood Blvd but this was perfect to us and one of the reasons we chose it.  We travelled by public transport (subway/bus) during our stay and found this hotel really handy as it was 2 mins walk to Vermont/Santa Monica station in one direction and probably a 5 min walk to Vermont/Sunset station.  The Metro Red line took us all the way to Union Station or alternatively all the way to Universal City/Studios the other way stopping in the middle of Hollywood Blvd along the way so very handy.

We enjoyed a (free) comedy show in the bar downstairs one evening which was a surprising extra.  If you are looking for a good value hotel and are not afraid to walk a few minutes or use public transport you will find the Hollywood Hotel is very suitable.",,5.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,8

If it was not for Michael at the front desk being a great help, i would rate this hotel 1 star!

Victoria B,14,"London, United Kingdom",2012-06-30,BUSINESS,2012-06-25,3,Only stay here if you have a car,"This is a great hotel if you're on a tight budget and have use of a car. I stay in LA/Hollywood about 5 times a year and have never found a cheaper 'decent' hotel so it's great value if you don't want to go as low as a motel. The rooms are clean and spacious with comfortable beds and cable TV, the free breakfast is great and the hotel itself is clean and well maintained. 

However, this is by no means a luxury option so it's important to be aware of that before your stay. The main problem is the location - it's quite a long way from the attractions of Hollywood, and not in an area that you'd want to walk around in at night. A car is essential here to avoid this (and high taxi charges every time you want to go anywhere). However, with a car, it's an easy drive from most places, and parking, while fairly expensive, is safe and easy in their large gated car park.

I've stayed here 5 times now and have no complaints (apart from the temperamental WiFi), but I think if I was expecting luxury then this might not be the case. This is essentially a great budget hotel offering a good value place to stay for people visiting LA with their own car.",,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,,,,,16

south_aussie63,18,,2012-06-30,COUPLES,2012-06-21,1,Not fit for purpose,"The number one priority for a hotel for me is a clean, comfortable place to sleep. If you also get a good price, a handy location and helpful staff these are added bonuses.
None of the above apply to this establishment.
The noise continued all night, from the road, the elevators and the chatter of reception staff.
I cannot believe there were no internal doors seperating reception from the rooms or double-glazing to block out traffic noise at a supposedly superior hotel. I have had far better sleeps in my car at truck stops.
This would be the most over-rated and over-priced hotel i have stayed in for a long time.
The location is also far from ideal as it is over 5 milles from the Hollywood attractions.
To top it off all but one of the reception staff were rude and made you feel like you were intruding on them. We were not told about any of the hotel facilities or the breakfast.

I then proceeded into room and found iron, decent bathroom and bed and large TV. But that's where the good impression ends. Bunch of things that I don't enjoy include aircon that doesn't allow user to set temperature (temperature is set by central system that heats below 65degF and cools when above 85degF). What's worse is the a/c control, which only allows fan speed control, is faulty and runs on high fan all the time which is very noisy! TV wasn't working and front desk sent someone up to fix it promptly but images weren't sharp. Location is not good, pretty far from main hollywood attractions which will cost you 15-20USD to get there by cab. Breakfast, though free, was pretty average. Lastly, wifi signal is weak and slow.

casualelegance88,76,,2012-06-30,FAMILY,2012-06-17,2,"Miles from anywhere, rude staff and noisy","I'll start with the good points. There aren't many. 
+Our room was lovely. 314. It had two large beds, a flat screen TV, HUGE shower as well as a fridge and mircowave.
+ It was clean.

OK, now for the bad. 
- First of all when we arrived, we were told that there was a $100 security deposit. After double/triple checking our reservation details, NOWHERE did it say that this was the case. I've also been advised that a security deposit shouldn't amount to more than one night's stay... which this was. However, front desk wouldn't budge. We found the manner of the people there incredibly patronising and often overbearing. So we handed over the last of our money (cue frantic call to the parents in the UK in the middle of the night) and headed to our room. 
- We weren't offered any help with our bags. For a hotel which purports to be high class this is a bit of a let down,
- The area is VERY dodgy. We had a beautiful view of a run down store and drunks patrolling the street chucking cans of beer around. I wouldn't walk around there at night. The noise from the road was horrendous, be it police sirens or fights breaking out. I also feel that the hotel misrepresented exactly where they were- we phoned beforehand and were told that they were close to Hollywood Blvd. Well. They are. Pity that it's at the very end and about $40/$50 in a cab to get to the decent part. (I say ""decent"" loosely. Let's go with touristy instead)
- There was construction work going on throughout our stay at the hotel with some rooms being refurbished. We were not notified of this upon check-in and it was disturbing, to say the least. 
- Front desk. Oh my word. Where to begin? It should be enough to say that every time we went there some poor soul was complaining or upset. We had our own fair share of problems and were met with impatience and condescension at every turn. 
We called from our room as the outside line wasn't working. My sister asked politely how to remedy this. She was hung up on. I called back and explained that she had been hung up on and merely wanted to know how to access the outside line. There was NO apology and an abrupt direction to press such-and-such, which we had already tried.Before I could point this out the lady slammed the phone down and refused to pick up again.  We simply had to use our mobiles instead.
Another instance was when I asked at reception what the best way to Venice Beach was. The man behind the desk slapped some documents onto the desk, told me to ""go right and get the bus"" and then proceeded to yell at someone over his shoulder. I asked for some clarification (as there were a few buses and stops) but he didn't seem to hear me and went off into the back. 
- There is a pool and sauna, yes. What they don't explain is that you need to reserve a space in the sauna, go to reception and pick up a seperate key. You're also not allowed to use the facilities on the day of check out. I went for an early morning dip and was barred entry. I asked why this was so, but apparently my money was only good enough the night before. Nice. 

Overall I would certainly NOT recommend this hotel. Our room was lovely, but after seeing another guest's I could see we were merely lucky on that front. It's not worth the hassle and rudeness. I had a much better experience at less expensive establishments.

TIP: If you're nearing the end of your funds then there's a cracking supermarket up the road, Jons, where you can pick up some cheap eats. All of the noticeboards are in Spanish but the staff there were only too happy to help.",,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,65

I couldn't stand the breakfast - every day the same artificial food :/  The rooms could have been cleaner ...

I was woken up twice before 8 AM during my stay by the sound of construction and hammering by workers on my floor. (Front desk did not inform us of this upon checking in). The free breakfast was once perfect, however they changed things and now most of your time is spent waiting in line for an omelete to be made behind 15 other guests.

To add insult to injury - the rooms were prepaid.  There was no offer to walk us - simply a ""too bad"" with a rather blank stare.

Location.....not great for Walk of fame etc, cost us $70 to get to Santa monica.  Yes its right on Hollywood Blvd but at the end of it !!!  About $30-$40 to get to the walk of fame and bus tours etc.

Nowhere is in walking distance so be ready to get the bus,metro & taxi.

Our room looked a bit run down and the toilet didn't flush well, however it was quiet and comfortable enough. We stayed on the first floor. Outside our sliding door was a tiny patio, however outside that was a courtyard that had a fountain, candles and  chairs, tables and couches. It was a nice area, except there was what looked to be a bar that was being worked on by a worker. 

They have a very nice free breakfast with an omelet bar and a nice dining area. It appears they have a comedy club and bar, but I didn't see it open. The neighborhood is a bit sketchy, but it is Hollywood. I felt safe in the hotel. 

My brother and sister-in-law stayed in the jacuzzi suite and it was very nice for the price. The bar is empty, but gorgeous. It would make a great place to party with a few friends. This room appeared to have been remodeled since ours. Overall the place is a decent place to stay. The staff were all VERY nice and respectful.

The omelette station was good, but the pastries were stale, didn't taste very fresh.  Our room was clean, however, the outlets were horrible.  Nothing would stay in the plugs, my appliances just fell right out.  the only outlet that worked was the one in the bathroom.  Overall the room was clean and looked nice after the cleaning people came and tidied up the room each day.  As for location, it's convenient to get to Hollywood and there are several restaurants in walking distance.  I highly recommend renting a car, because the public transportation would take you much longer to get anywhere, even though traffic in LA is horrible.

Jay H,54,"London, United Kingdom",2012-05-31,COUPLES,2012-05-31,3,"Nice location, can be noisy.","First of all the location of this hotel is excellent. Its situated in Vermont a quiet neighbourhood, and 15 - 20 minutes to Universal Studios, Paramount Studios and the airport. We did venture outside a few times and found it to be safe and had no issues, there is a small convenience store opposite which was handy for beers and snackss, but to other than that you need a car to get to places.
 Its located near to a large hospital , so there were sirens going past all the time, so try to avoid the rooms located over the main road and side road.
We  had issue with ants in the room, we left our left over takeaway in the bin and woke to find ants having a field day, so we left the bin outside the room, which was left by the cleaners for 2 days. So any food left over was thrown outside in the communal bins. Also one day we parked our car close to a tree in the car park and found ants inside the car.
The wireless was free , but they charge $20 per day to park the car in their secure car park, which should be included for guests. 
The single queen room itself is ok in size, it has a fridge, microwave, and the usual rest. It doesnt deserve the 4 star rating or the glamourous Hollywood Hotel name, but it did the job for us. The lifts also take forever to take you anywhere so take a book!
We never used the pool area, so cant really comment.

Reservation had been made on March 24th. Last Saturday, 5/5/12, us, family of four, arrived to the hotel around 7:10 pm. Having tickets to the 8 pm show at Pantages, asked the front desk person what he would recommend: checking in at that time or after the show. The gentleman, believe his name was Michael(?) (glasses), checked our reservation in the computer and told us that the room was there for us and ""it will be there"" and that for the sake of time we should go see the show and check in after. Sounds nice, isn’t it?  Coming back after the show (~11:30 pm) we see different front desk person (Josh?) ""handling"" an upset family that is trying to check in. The family you can tell just arrived from other country (a lot of shrink-wrapped luggage) and only one boy in the family spoke a little English. The front desk person didn’t make any effort to be polite to that family: smirking at them, talked to them in long formal-language sentences that they couldn’t understand and when they asked him what he meant he would repeat the same sentences only a little slower. Not sure what the issue with their reservation was, but at the end the front desk person made a statement that he gave them a different room than they originally booked, two-beds instead of one-bed, and they would have to move to another room next day. Now it is our turn to check in, and guess what? THERE IS NO ROOM for us, everything is taken!!! With the same superior+formal politeness attitude the front desk gentleman announcing that he is not sure when and how we booked that room (again, we did it on 3/24, through the AAA web site, but received the confirmation directly from the hotel) and, if we called before arriving, we would have been told that there was no room. When I told him that we didn’t call, but arrived in person a few hours earlier and had been told that the room was there, the response was, “I don’t know why, I just got here 30 minutes ago“.  He called (TO HIS CREDIT, will give him that) the Comfort Inn on the same street about 5-10 min drive from them and that motel happened to have a room.

She had tickets to the Ellen DeGeneres which was the main reason for our trip.  We stayed at the Hollywood Hotel - The Hotel of Hollywood, which was booked through Expedia at a really good rate (128.03 taxes in per night).  We neglected to rent a car since the hotel was located near the Santa Monica & Vermont station - a two minute walk - if that.  $5 will get you an all day pass, $1.50 to ride the bus, per stop.

We checked in on April 4th around 4:30-5ish.  The staff at the front desk were nice.  We were given the keys to our room and at first glance, I was a little disappointment (can't speak for my friend) at the room.  It was definitely dated (wall paper, old fashion curtions etc).  When viewing the washroom, we noticed a facecloth (used?) handing on the shower head, and the tv desk looked dirty.  There was also no safe in our room, which upon reading previous reviews knew this was the case, however read that you could request a room with a safe.  We called down to ""complain"" about the dirty facecloth and to inquire about changing to a room that had a safe.  The front desk staff apologized for the facecloth and said someone would come up to remove it.  I thought, lovely, so, no new room :(  Then they called back to say we would be switching rooms.  Our initial room was on the 2nd floor, facing the side street off of North Vermont.  The room we switched too was 318, same side of the hotel, same dated room, but cleaner, no safe.  Ah well, can't have it all.

This room was cleaner, again, dated but for the amount of time you spend in the room, who cares really.  The bathroom (in both rooms) looked ok, I mean, it's not the Hilton people.  I did notice that there was a vent in the shower...kind of a weird spot to have the vent.  In all, we had a good nights sleep, we had hot water, the room was always cleaned upon our arrival back to the hotel in the evenings.  No bed bugs to report either - phew!

There is no room service at this hotel but you get a free daily breakfast which is awesome.  The dining area is located on R1.  (This hotel also has an elevator, which in past reviews people posted there was no elevator). Breakfast consisted of mini sausages (awesome), omeletes with numerous veggies to choose from (tomatoe, peppers, mushrooms, onion, ham, cheese, spinach etc.), home made waffles, cereal, croissants, toast, fruit, tea, coffee, juice, milk.  The ladies there are great, so, please tip them well :)  We ate in the dining area so can't write about staff telling us off for leaving with food.  

The hotel also has a computer in the main lobby, which is slow.  It also sports a pool (didn't check it out but seen a sign), spa (again, didn't check it out but seen the sign).

For us being in the city for the first time, we have nothing to compare our experience too.  All we can say is that we enjoyed our stay, the staff were friendly and very helpful.  We had our days planned out with the exception of our last day, Saturday, and we were wondering what would be best way to get to Santa Monica beach.  The guy behind the front desk (he wore glasses, didn't catch his name) told us what number bus to take, where to catch it, how much it would cost, where to get the ticket.  It saved us a lot of money - from having to cab it.  They also called cabs ahead of time for us for when we had dinner reservations or tours.  Can't ask for any better really.  

We didn't encounter any rude staff, they were all very helpful which made our stay even better.

The hotel is out of the way in the event you want to go to Beverly Hills, Santa Monica beach, Venice Beach, but as I mentioned above, is close to a bus station (the ride to Santa Monica Beach from the Santa Monica/vermont bus station took 1 hr, we took the rapid bus), and is close to Hollywood Blvd which is where you'll catch the Kodak Theatre, Hollywood Walk of Fame, Grauman's Chinese Theatre.

If I decide to back to LA, I could see myself staying at this hotel again, just because I would be familiar with the area, but I would also check our other hotels that would be more ""central""...but not because I didn't enjoy my stay.

Oh, we didn't venture the streets at night, we did wonder across the street to a convienence store and for 2 girls who live in a smaller city compared to LA, that was about all we could handle ;)",,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,,,23
imcolombo,2,,2012-04-30,COUPLES,2012-04-15,2,"Hotel OK, service TERRIBLE","This comment relates to the breakfast staff.  If you don't care about the breakfast service, you can ignore.

It has a nice breakfast, if you obey the rules.  If your wife is sick and you want to take her a piece of toast or orange juice, hopefully this won't happen to you.

About four employees screaming at me in both English and Spanish about if I take a piece of toast and a glass to the room they will be fired, so if I don't stop, they will call the police.  All of this in front of about 50-100 guests.  Not exactly my definition of a ""service"" industry.  So I left the juice and toast, and said that they'd better throw it out anyway and not serve it to the remainig people.

When I shared this with my wife, she was quite upset.

But if you just want a clean place to crash it's OK.  If you have transportation, I'd recommend that you stay somewhere else, because the only advantage is location.  And if you've been there, Hollywood is not what you think.  Meaning that it's a place to see in the day, sleazy at night.

Most reviews here are either too good or too bad.  Mine is about the service, not the actual hotel.

J M,3,,2012-03-31,COUPLES,2012-04-15,1,Do not stay here.,"I shall keep this brief, and not give a full description of the debacle that was our 36 hour stay in this awful hotel.

We had a late check-in - 11.45pm and had been travelling for almost 24 hours when we arrived at this hotel to be greeted by an indifferent receptionist who checked us into a smaller room that we had booked. We were too tired to object and decided to rectify the error in the morning as we had booked to stay for 3 nights. The room, 117 was small, dingy and dark, with a dirty bathroom. 

Reluctantly they gave us another room 256, which was larger however the loo flooded the bathroom. Only after we insisted to be moved were we given another room - 111 which was of the same ilk as 117. At 11.30pm that night the door opened and two people started to enter the room - the reception had given door keys to some other guests. The phone rang whereupon the receptionist demanded to know why we were in the room.

The following morning we went to reception to say that we no longer wished to stay at the hotel and wanted to speak to the manager as we were appalled with the service and did not want to pay for the lack of service we received. The manager wasn't available and we were told he would contact us at the hotel we were moving to. He did not call, however eventually we did get an email offering a reduction in the payment for our stay, which we accepted, on the understanding that we would not make any further claims.

The service was unacceptable and we were treated with disdain.",,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-10-12,"Dear Guest...

lynda v,1,,2012-03-31,BUSINESS,2012-04-09,3,LA ACCOMMODATION,"Stayed there in March 2012.  The room was very very very small. Too much furniture in it, but in saying that, you dont spend a lot of time in the room.  
What got me about this place was that they are doing renovations downstairs, but in the parts that guests dont use.  The restaurant for breakfast was pretty average, and the food pretty basic, but ive had worse.  Some of the staff were great, and some not too good.  The lift was the slowest i have ever been in. As far as attractions, we just caught the subway (a five minute walk).  If you stay there, about a 10 minute walk down the road is a fabulous 50`s Restaurant, definately worth a look and you must try their Shakes.  As far as safety was concerned, it was ok.

The hotel misrepresented its proximity to the major Hollywood attractions on the web site. It is not a short mile nor is it walking distance to Hollywood Blvd. & Highland Ave. You have to take a 10-minute subway ride and walk a block to the Metro on Santa Monica Blvd. & Vermont. The computer available for guests is older. It froze many times and you cannot print or save files to the desktop (or Documents folder). The hotel should consider upgrading and offering a business center so guests can print their own airline passes, maps and coupons.

cujoetta,74,,2012-03-31,SOLO,2012-03-26,5,What is up with all the negativity people?????,"I came from Vancouver Canada and it was my first time in Los Angeles and after staying for 5 days it only made me want to come back for more. I would 100% stay again at Hollywood Hotel for the most important reason of all the location. How much close to the action can you possibly get. It is a block and a half walk, less than 5 minutes to the Red Line Metro station and that was my main mode of transportation the entire time I was there. I had ZERO problems with the location and found it to be safe either during the day or at night. 
In addition, there is a Rite Aid open until 11 pm a 2 minute walk from the hotel where I was able to get anything I needed. 
It was 4 stops to where the action was at Hollywood and Highland and perfect for all my tours I booked and just a couple more stops to Universal Studios which made my entire trip. 

As for the cleanliness, I found it to be spotless. I have stayed in 4 and 5 star hotels in Mexico that weren't as clean. The maids were always smiling, never failed to say good morning and as for the so-called rude front desk staff???? I never encountered any of that. Anyone I dealt with was more than welcoming and helpful. 

I never found any issues with the air-conditioning; there was a switch that I could control at all times and it was ideal for the hot, hot weather I encountered. 

As for my room, I found it to be perfect, especially the bathroom. Loved the shower that you could walk right into, the abundance of clean towels and again very well maintained. 

I had requested a safe and I had a room with one so I was quite happy with that. 

As for the free breakfast; again what is up with the complaints people????
I had toasted bagels with cream cheese and orange juice along with fruit each morning followed by yogurt and I was more than happy with that. In addition, there was a fresh omelette station if I so desired with pretty much any sort of filling I could dream of. 

I must comment on the mgr Jeff's assistance in making sure I was happy with the room and made sure I was promptly taken care of weeks in advance. Excellent customer service that again you don't get in the big so called ""name brand hotels.""

Whirrledpeas,136,"Colonial Beach, Virginia",2012-03-31,NONE,2012-03-22,2,A Waste of Money,"I'm very easy to please, but I'm going to be honest and fair with this review. It's lengthy, but will tell you everything you need to know if you are considering staying here.

We stayed for four nights at the Hollywood Hotel. Upon checking in, I was told there would be a $100 authorization on my credit card and that I would be paying for the room once we checked out. Not only did they authorize that fee, they also authorized the full booked stay and the parking, which was 20 bucks a night.

To be honest, I prefer to be charged in the beginning of the stay so I don't have to worry about it later, but I also prefer to be told this. Communication was not the best in this situation. 

The second and third day, we had no hot water and the elevators were not working. This was due to the generator breaking down. We had to take a warm bath using an ice bucket full of microwaved water. Understandable, because things happen. However, we also came back to our room to find an entire shopping bag full of food gone. I would have given the cleaning staff the benefit of the doubt on this one thinking that it could have been trash, except the bag weighed a good ten pounds or so. 

So, at this point, we had no hot water, had to walk the stairs everytime we went outside, stolen food, and bad communication at the front desk. Then, I log onto my bank account to see an unauthorized hold on my account from the hotel. They couldn't exactly tell me what it was for. Ahh.

So, with everything going on, we asked what the hotel was going to do to compensate us for the inconveniences that were adding up. They offered to take parking off for one night. We eventually got them to take it off for the entire stay, so that was nice. Though, it only ended up being for our first three nights instead of the agreed full stay.

On Sunday, the breakers in our room kept blowing and maintenance had to come three times to try and fix them. We only had one working plug that night which we used for the space heater. That meant none of us could charge our phones. We couldn't make coffee or use the microwave. Also, the parking gate was broken, so our cars were not that secure. 

For us, this wasn't the worst stay ever, but it was the worst one we have paid $140 bucks for, hands down.  Our last night we went two blocks up to the Travelodge. It's not as pretty on the outside, but everything worked and everyone was nice and friendly. 

I do want to be fair and give this hotel props for what they do right. The beds are extremely comfy and have thick, down comforters on them. Best bed I've ever slept on in a hotel.  The breakfast is awesome and there is a wide variety of foods to pick from. Waffles and omelets are made in the spot!

The location isn't as good as it could be for the same price as something closer to the attractions but it certainly is NOT the ghetto. At all, not even close. I never felt in danger during my stay here.

In conclusion, will I stay here again? No, not likely. Had we been compensated more, perhaps. But we weren't and nothing worked. We were on vacation and had to deal with everything being broken when all we wanted to do was enjoy ourselves. 

I will say that I don't think my stay was a good representation of the hotel because these things do happen sometimes. However, the way in which the staff handled our inconvenience was not appropriate nor helpful. It's a nice hotel and would've loved to come back but there are other hotels out there just as good that are cheaper and friendlier. Wouldn't recommend.",,1.0,1.0,,2.0,1.0,4.0,,,,,63

Yes the customer service could be a lot better - the staff come across as very dry - but if you can ignore that - your stay there will be awesome.

The location is a huge PLUS for those who do not wish to drive or rent a car. The train/metro station is a short 5 min walk and we had no troubles catching it what-so-ever. It was USD1 each way or USD7 for a whole day pass.

Ingridlacosta,2,,2012-03-31,NONE,2012-03-14,1,Staff is unhelpful. Be prepared for possible random hammering. Save yourself the trouble.,"I know this is a long review, but I must get this off my chest. My stay at The Hollywood Hotel, ""The Hotel of Hollywood"" was NOT a pleasant one! Let me start by saying that the original hotel I wanted to stay in stated clearly on their website that they were having renovations done and thus, because I'm on vacation, I didn't want to deal with noise or any inconveniences so I chose The Hollywood Hotel. Big mistake! What This hotel failed to mention on their website and even upon my checking in, is that they too were undergoing renovations! So on Monday morning, while I understand it is a work day for most, the hammering began at about 9:00 AM at a noise level that can only seem to be coming from, literally, inside my room!
 I tried to ignore it in hopes that it was just a quick job that was absolutely necessary as, again, it was NINE AM! By the way, there is a three hour time difference from my hometown to LA time, a change that naturally affects ones sleeping habits. 
Once I finally couldn't handle the incessant hammering any further(2 hours) I call the front desk to inquire about the noise and see what can be done. The unhelpful lady on the other end of that phone responded by saying ""ma'am it is 11:00 AM"". As if A. I don't know the time, B. I should be bright eyed and bushy tailed at 8:00 AM before the hammering on MY vacation or C. Hammering at a hotel where patrons clearly have traveled, in my case, quite far to escape the noise and chaos of our regular lives, is perfectly ok. 
I immediately ask to speak to her manager whom is no where to be found. I then get up and get dressed, against my will to get some answers. Why the hammering? Why the lack of notification? Why the lack of customer service at ""The Hotel of Hollywood""? 
I confront the attendant with whom I spoke to on the phone (I shall refrain from using her name, as I believe in karma and perhaps it was her first day on the job... It wasn't). I tell her I need to speak to the manager. Manager is still no where to be found. She is pretty clueless as to the LACK of customer service and how she merely brushes the incident off. I tell her to have the manager call me immediately, there's a long pause as I expect her to take down my cell phone number. She doesn't and assumes that now that I've been rudely awakened I'm actually going to hang out at the hotel to listen to more of this heavy metal clanking to await the managers phone call! I have to direct her to write down my cell phone number... 
It's been 24 hours now and I still have not received ANY form of communication, despite my leaving a message via telephone to the unhelpful lady from the front desk, seeing the same girl in person, leaving a voicemail to him, and speaking to the night manager!
Needless to say, I will never stay at this hotel again. The amenities and service from all staff except one was beyond sub par. The website is deceiving. It is not close to much. The rooms aren't as wonderful as the pictures on their website and the shuttle information is also a little tricky and vague. 
 I will however mention Elvira, she makes wonderful eggs with a smile and great pleasure. The only staff member who was concerned with the well being of those retreating at this hotel. ",,3.0,1.0,,2.0,2.0,3.0,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-10-12,"Dear Guest...

Let me just say that I was comforted the moment we checked in.  The front desk- Bobby- was as pleasant as could be.  We got our room in seconds and although it was a little small, it was clean and bright (even at 3am)!  My boyfriend and I have stayed all over this world and we both agreed that we have NEVER, ever slept with the comforter on a bed- until now.  I've read reviews with people talking about dirty bedding- we did not see this and we actually slept with ALL the bedding.  It was the most comfortable sleep I have had away from home!   The room was a little small, but it served its purpose as we were not there to hang out in a hotel room.  As far as the people that criticize the breakfast, it is a FREE breakfast!  As it is not ""gourmet"", once again it was good and served its purpose!  The eggs looked delicious, but I was eating light so I opted for some toast, banana, and yogurt.  How can you knock that?  OK, everyone complains about the neighborhood...  I get it- not the best.  That would be my biggest complaint, however living in major cities has prepped me for that.  The metro station was perfect and the fact that my boyfriend is familiar with the area helped millions.  I would just say make sure you are familiar with where you are going and you can navigate it no problem.  Our only other problem is we tried to do a small load of laundry and it cost us $12.  The detergent machine kept eating money and not giving product... we were told no refund could be made... oh well, we sucked that up.  One more thing, we had a blast downstairs when we would pop in for the comedy.  Overall,  I had a great trip... the hotel was great as well- I thought it had a certain charm.  Be skeptical whenyou read further reviews....  ignorant people taking things out in the wrong way-  this hotel was VERY clean and the staff was VERY nice!!!",We were on the Vermont side- little noise didn&#39;t bother us,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-30,"Dear Guest,

After some careful research and review of fellow 'Trip Advisors' we selected this hotel not expecting any bells and whistles but good average hotel standards and that is what we received.  

Location was good for our purposes and if you are looking to see any of the Frank LLoyd Wirght architecture, Hollywood tourists or even Griifiths Observatory the location could not be better.  The front desk staff service was inconsistant but nothing to be upset about.  The attendant in the gift shop didn't realize that the front desk will mail your postcards for you and had told us that we needed to go to a post office to get stamps - but couldn't tell us where one was.  

the included breakfast was just okay and nothing really special - but worth the nominal extra.  Given the L.A. environment I truly enjoyed the sercure parking.  This Hotel is kind of out the way and the area around it is not any different than any other urban American centre with some boarded up buildings and scetchy people walking around.  The Hotel has gone out of its way to ensure the safety of their patrons and I applaud them for that.

We arrived to our first trip to LA so excited to have the worst customer service at the reception desk by a very rude man who was most unhelpful and full of attitude. The pictures show you the back of the hotel the front is a dive and very poor the room was absolutely frozen in the evenings. We had a blocked toilet and they have no maintenance team i was aksed to use a plunger and fix the toilet myself! As for breakfast you are better off at mc donalds! They have no choice and 1 lady who cookes the eggs for you leaving you in a queue for almost 30 mins every morning and you are not allowed to have more then 1 serving of eggs! Be warned these are not real 100% eggs when i asked if i could have a fresh eggs cracked i was told the liquid they have in the bottles are eggs but i saw the lady go to the kitchen to refil the jar and she opened the refidgerator and poured out som liquid from a carton and mixed something else in it what on earth were we eating! then the only other option is toast. the rooms are so dated and need work, the bedding was dirty with stains on the sheets and they are most reluctant to help you. you are charged to park at the hotel so even if your deal states free parking as did mine which i showed them clearly in black and white i was told i had to pay the daily rate of $18 per night plus tax. I have never met such rude front desk staff and the only time i saw the lady at the front desk (looked spanish or even philipino) smile was on my checkout when she was busy flirting with a wealthy male customer discussing cars so another lady served me instead that i had not seen in my whole weeks there and she was acutally the only member of staff who was helpful and understood what customer service was.
the only one good thing i have to say is that it is very well located and we spent all our days out of the hotel to avoid being in such a small dingy stuffy dirty place. this hotel should be 1* and shut down!",no room is good here,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,hollywoodhotel,General Manager,2012-03-09,"Dear j3an7,

We are delighted you chose Hollywood Hotel during your visit to Hollywood and the Los Angeles area!  We know you have many hotels to choose from and we appreciate your business.

Your critique of your check in experience is likewise unhelpful as it does not give a name of the man at the reception desk nor explain how he was rude or unhelpful, which is unfortunate.

We have all kinds of pictures on our official website and on our listing here  and  ""the pictures"" are not all from the back of the hotel!  The pictures were taken with ordinary cameras and without any special lenses.  The pictures have not been altered in any way.    We have 3 fountains in the hotel and the technicolor fountain with our Hollywood Hotel signage is our most popular and many guests take pictures posing with it daily.  Yes, it is located at our rear entrance, which is the entrance guests use most when parking in our lot.

We have a maintenance team to unblock toilets and a maintenance man with plunger in hand came to your room at 3am, but for some reason did not let him in.  The room temperature can be simply adjusted with the thermostat on the wall, if the room was cold.

Yes, we do have a great complimentary hot buffet breakfast which includes cooked to order omelets with fresh added ingredients such as green peppers, bacon bits, onions, tomatoes, spinach, mushrooms, jalapenos peppers, shredded cheese and more.  We also have egg white only omelets.  The omelets are very good and hence very popular and there can be a line at the omelet station during the breakfast rush hour between 8:30am-10am.   The restaurant opens at 6:30am and the omelet line, if any, can be avoided from 6:30am-8:30am.

Our eggs for the omelets are 100% real. For a faster cooking time, our eggs are pre cracked and  placed in chilled carafes.  If the cooks cracked eggs at the omelet station for each omelet it would just add to the wait time.   We also have fresh eggs at the omelet for sunny side up or over easy requests.

Our snow white sheets and duvets are cleaned daily by our in house laundry crew. We use a leading name brand laundry detergent, Whitener, a Destainer and a softener for all of our  300 thread count linen and duvets.  All sheets and duvets are inspected by our laundry staff for stains, holes, frays which are then put aside and given to charity organizations.

Dear Tripadvisor Readers,

Our hotel is the only hotel in Hollywood which offers complimentary cooked to order omelets with fresh added ingredients.... and just like any great blockbuster Hollywood Movie, the wait can be a few minutes at peak times.   Think about it.... If they weren't so delicious, no one would wait for them.

Also...  we do charge for parking, however there are some promos and coupons for free parking. Each promo or coupon has special terms and conditions which must be followed to receive the free parking... So please read them carefully.

j3an7,2,"Sacramento, California",2012-02-29,COUPLES,2012-02-22,2,Don't stay here.,"The Hollywood Hotel is nothing like the pictures they have posted on Priceline or their own website.  The only thing that looked the same was the fountain, but that was a disappointment because you can't even see the fountain from the front.  The fountain is actually located in the back of the hotel, in the parking lot.

I booked the hotel for a total of four people.  When I checked in, I was told they were going to charge me $30 for the extra two people because when I booked the room through Priceline, I supposedly only reserved the room for 2.  The man checking me in told me that it was okay that I had four people but then only two of us would be able to have breakfast the next morning.

So anyway since the breakfast was already included in the room price, two out of the four of us went downstairs for breakfast the next day.  A lot of people who have reviewed this hotel gave great reviews about their breakfast, but truthfully, it wasn't all that.  BEWARE OF THE OMELETTE LINE! They have one person who makes one omelette at a time.  We ended up waiting 20 minutes for one omelette.

As for the room, it was picture perfect, up until I really tried to get comfortable.  The bed was hard, had me tossing and turning all night.  The sheets were white and made the room look clean but once I got onto the bed, I noticed there were strands of black curly hair all over and surely they weren't ours as we do not have curly hair.  The room was very hot during the night time.  The air vent/fan did not circulate enough air at all.  We couldn't even leave the sliding door open because of the ""shared balcony"" and the fact that there wasn't even a screen to the sliding door.

The hotel provided shampoo, conditioner, hand soap, and even a shower cap.  The bathroom was okay, until I got into the shower.  The tub is set up high so it felt like I was going to hit the ceiling while showering.",,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,hollywoodhotel,General Manager,2012-03-07,"Dear j3an7,

We are delighted you chose Hollywood Hotel during your visit to Hollywood and the Los Angeles area!  We know you have many hotels to choose from and we appreciate your business.

The pictures on Priceline and on our website are actual real pictures taken with ordinary cameras and without any special lenses.  I actually took a few of them myself with my own iPhone.  The pictures have not been doctored in any way.  There are also many pictures posted here on Tripadvisor taken by guests such as yourself.    We have 3 fountains in the hotel and the technicolor fountain with our Hollywood Hotel signage is our most popular and many guests take pictures posing with it daily.  It's a novelty picture.  Yes, it is located at our rear entrance, which is the entrance guests use most when parking in our lot.

We do have a 4th fountain on the drawing  board for the front of the hotel, so check back with us in a year or two and your wish might just be fulfilled.  

You booked your reservation for only 2 guests and we do charge an additional fee for extra guests in the room.  I wonder.... if you flew in from Sacramento to Los Angeles ... did you reserve 4 seats or only 2 seats as well?

Yes, we do have a great complimentary hot buffet breakfast which includes cooked to order omelets with fresh added ingredients such as green peppers, bacon bits, onions, tomatoes, spinach, mushrooms, jalapenos peppers, shredded cheese and more.  We also have egg white only omelets.  The omelets are very good and hence very popular and there can be a line at the omelet station during the breakfast rush hour between 8:30am-10am.  If you are in a little hurry and need your omelets, come down to the restaurant before 8:30am as the restaurant opens at 6:30am. Yes, there is 1 cook however there are 2 burners and they make them pretty quick.

I'm glad you liked your room and i'm sorry you felt the bed was hard.  We have Sealy Posturepedic Plush beds which are considered one of the best beds in the industry.  We have have removable pillow tops on each beds as well to make them extra soft.  I'm sorry about the strand of hair.  Our snow white sheets and duvets are cleaned daily by our in house laundry crew.

Dear Tripadvisor Readers,

Our hotel is the only hotel in Hollywood which offers complimentary cooked to order omelets with fresh added ingredients.... and just like any great blockbuster Hollywood Movie, the wait can be a few minutes to have it at peak times.   Think about it.... If they weren't so delicious, no one would wait for them. Just some food for thought....just don't let it give you mental indigestion!

Also...  be smart and take the high road.  If you are 4 guests, please reserve for 4 guests on your reservation.  It's less expensive to reserve for the correct amount of guests when making your  reservation and a faster check in process than adding guests ala carte at check in.

My boyfriend and I were in Hollywood to see my favorite band play and I purchased a record at the show.  The record somehow slipped behind the desk in our room while we were packing and we accidently left it behind.  I called the hotel as soon as I realized it was missing and was told to call back -- after two days of calls I was notified that housekeeping had thrown it away!!! I'm completely devestated.  I realize that housekeeping can't hold on to every little thing that gets left behind but who throws away a wrapped, obviously new LP record?",,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,hollywoodhotel,General Manager,2012-02-17,"Dear Sarah H,

We are delighted you were visiting Hollywood to see your favorite band play wrote a review on Tripadvisor about our hotel!

Please share with us who this band is so we all can look out for them the next time they are in town.  I'm surprised they were selling the old formatted 18""x18"" LP vinyl records. Wow! It's been almost  20 years since I've heard anyone say ""LP Record"". Do you have an old record player too?  FYI - LP stands for ""Long Play"" for our younger readers. 

It's a shame you misplaced your LP Record behind the desk in your guest room.  Actually, I do not understand how that is even possible in our hotel, since all of the desks in our guest rooms have NO backing for anything to hide behind!  We specifically designed our desks this way to prevent this kind is mishap from happening.  One can clearly see the under the desk and to the wall the desk is pushed up against without any hindrance.

You also stated you called the hotel regarding your lost LP record.  We have no log of anyone calling for a lost LP Record either and I asked everyone at the front desk and in housekeeping regarding your lost LP record. No one received such a call and believe me they would have remembered this one! Furthermore, if one of our housekeepers had found a brand new, wrapped LP record they certainly would not have thrown it away! The housekeeper would have would have recorded the room # and the date the LP Record was found and would have placed it in our lost and found department.  

I'm sorry, we have no record of your record and I believe you wrote your review for the wrong hotel.  You probably stayed in another Hotel in Hollywood with a similar name to ours, which obviously does not care about lost or misplaced  guest items like we do.

Dear Tripadvisor Readers,

Rest assured, we keep all lost or misplaced items for 90 days before we give them away to charity.   We also have a lost and found program and log which keeps track of all items.  If any guests inform us about their lost or misplaced items and email us their mailing address where to ship the item(s), we do so right away. Please report any lost or misplaced items by emailing info@hollywoodhotel.net or by completing a lost and found form on our website.

WinderHall,17,,2012-02-29,BUSINESS,2012-02-13,4,Good value and great location,"This was my second trip to LA but the first time I have actually stayed in the Hollywood area.  The hotel was recommended by business colleagues.  It was certainly good value and in a good location.  The hotel was part of the Ramada group but now appears to be independently owned.  Unfortunately, it still feels a little boring and corporate and is a bit worn round the edges - don't come here if you are looking for swanky luxury.

On the plus side the staff were very helpful and the price was particularly good given it's very central Hollywood location.  The room was clean, the bed comfy and the bed-linen smelt and felt unbelievably luxurious.

The best thing about the Hollywood Hotel is it's location.  It gave me the chance to explore Hollywood away from Sunset and Hollywood Boulevard.  Having seen the touristy bits of Hollywood on my previous trip I wasn't particularly looking forward to a return visit.  Even though I have heard this before (and not believed it), LA really is a surprising and delightful city if you can put your preconceptions to one side.  Away from the tiny bit of Hollywood given over to tourism, the neighbourhood is delightful.  Lots of really cool shops, restaurants and interesting streets to explore.

Susan L,56,"Pembrey, United Kingdom",2012-02-29,COUPLES,2012-02-10,4,Lovely hotel shame about the breakfast,"Booked this hotel online, clean and well maintained bedrooms, our room had a fridge, microwave, tea and coffee facilities, flat screen tv.  The reception staff were very helpful, the room we were given was overlooking the courtyard, only down side was the shared balcony, which meant that you could leave your windows open at night when you were sleeping!!  The rooms were small compared to other USA hotels I have stayed in but it was suitable for the two of us.

Internet and a computer in reception provided for residents free of charge, was quite impressed with this.  The only down side was the breakfast either they should do better or as in other hotels in the US forget about it and let the residents get it else where,  The first morning we went there was a miserable looking woman making omelletes, my husband went to order both his and mine, but was told in no uncertain terms that only one per person,so I had to go and order my own instead of making the toast for the both of us, when the omellete was made it was like a small pancake verylittle of it, the pastries kept running out and they were very slow to replenish, the tea was like dishwater only 2 tea bags for a big pot.

I thought parking was abit pricey though, $18 per night, but this maybe good in the US.  The hotel push a tour around LA for what it is I would well avoid quite boring and couldn't see much from the transport provided cost nearly $200 for both of us and it was quite disappointing.",,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-30,"Dear Guest,

MinnesotaMaven,29,,2012-02-29,BUSINESS,2012-02-09,3,Just fine,"Was here for just one night in early February. Some plusses, some minuses. 

This seems to be a rebranded Ramada Inn - in fact the area map they gave me still had Ramada on in, not Hollywood. The place had a very 1960s vibe architecturally, but without 1960s charm. Rooms overlooked the outdoor pool area, with a rectangular slice of the sky above. I liked that I could step out onto a patio from my room - what Minnesotans doesn't love that in February? - but there was no chair to sit on in order to enjoy the warm air.

Got a great rate, but the person who made my reservation didn't send me a confirmation. When I called and asked them to send it a few weeks later, they didn't. Not sure what the problem was, but when I called a third time, I just took the confirmation number over the phone.

Hotel was easy to get to using public transportation. Great directions on their website. Room was tiny, and the decor was dated. But it was clean and the bed was comfortable. Visited the basement bar after my meeting was over. Pricy, but nice that it was there. It was filled that night with young locals doing karaoke. Had to stop at the front desk to get my in-room coffee for the morning - maid service had forgotten to re-stock my room. Got a coupon for free breakfast at check-in, but didn't partake as my morning meeting also served breakfast.

The staff members were great as was the location for a meeting at the nearby Kaiser Permanente building. But I can't speak to whether it is convenient for seeing other L.A. attractions.",,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,,,,,19

Monday we had plans to go to the Warner Brothers Studios and for Sunday we wanted to check out the Chinese Theater and Wax Museum, and this hotel was the perfect in between point.  The metro is just a short walk from the hotel (couple of blocks, maybe a ¼ of a mile.   
   After reading other reviews about the neighborhood the hotel is in, I was a little nervous about it, but I didn't find it too terrible. 
   I thought the complimentary breakfast was really good compared to similar hotels. Eggs, omelets and waffles were all made to order, toast, sausage, orange juice, lemonade, milk, cereal, pastries, fruit, and bagels. The only downside was that Sunday morning they only had one person making the eggs and omelets so it took awhile.  
   The room was a good size and the beds were really comfortable.  The bathroom was adequate, but it was a little annoying having the hold down the button on the blow dryer, I suggest bringing your own.  The outlets in the room were really loose; I had to watch carefully when I was curling my hair because it kept coming unplugged. 
   It was nice that we were able to park our cars behind secure gates, but my only major complaint was that we had to pay $18 a night for each car.  
   Just FYI, when you check in they have you write down the names of all the people that are staying in the room and use this information for the complimentary breakfast.  When you come down for breakfast the staff will ask for your room number and how many people are eating and will not allow you to take food back to your room.

Paid about £310 for a room with two queens for three people. Room was fairly big and more than adequate for three people/three large suitcases.  Bathroom was basic - shower, sink and toilet (plenty of towels) - clean so what more do you want? Free wireless was great but at times was a bit slow but nothing unsurmountable and having a laundry room was helpful.  We were on third floor and near sauna room which unfortunately we had no time for. To negate some myths, we never had any issues with the temperature in the rooms,  and the location contrary to various negative comments, is absolutely NO ISSUE. We walked or used metro for three straight days and had no car. Never had any issue going to Hollywood or Universal.  Metro contrary to various myths, is literally 3-5 mins walk and not a distance at all. (Vermont/Santa Monica station).  Its three stops from main Hollywood and about 5 from Universal (20mins).
We took airport shuttles to and from hotel to LAX (cost £29 -£31) total one way for three people. Bear in mind you are in shuttle for up to 2 hours as you pick up various people, Bit frrustrating but knocks off considerable amount considering cab fare.  Just read my book and slept and to be honest driving around various suburbs of LA was not a major hindrance and got to see things I would not have seen.

Back to room, various takeout options (hotel lets you get this delivered), and restaurants nearby. If you walk up towards Vermont/Sunset station you;'ll find a brilliant Mexican (Yucas). Breakfast in hotel was absolutely fine. Okay so its not fresh juice or made to order eggs, but it was absolutely fine and set us up for the day.  Toast, tea, coffee, fruit and FRESH WAFFLES made to order - what more do you want. Also sausages and bacon as awell so not sure why all the negative reviews. Okay I think I would have eaten out if it wasn't included,  but really for the inclusion in room price, it  was a steal and very filling. Staff in the breakfast room very friendly.

In fact the staff we encountered were all friendly, particularly one who made sure we didn't lose our money  in the detergent vending machines as they were temperamental and sent us across the road to convenienvce store which was selling detergent farily cheaply.  

The only ngative is LA hotels are expensive - lets just say  I stayed in Vegas for 8 nights in various nicer hotels sand it cost me the same as 3 nights in LA!!

Neighbourhood was fine there were a few 'dodgy' elements but to be honest most of LA was like that - we never had any trouble",,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-30,"Dear Guest,

It is a beautiful hotel, the beds are amazing and plush, very clean rooms, good continental breakfast which goes until 10 which is nice. Very good hotel for the price.

My only concerns is that parking is 18 dollars a night which is a bit crazy, if the hotel considered lowering this price or giving a better deal for staying a week the hotel would perfect. 

Another concern is that there are no do not disturb signs and the maids would try to come clean at 9 am, I'm usually still sleeping then but am always out by 11 or 12. The maids would just walk in and see us sleeping which was awkward. This Could be a way for the hotel to improve, get do not disturb signs or tell the maids to wait until later.","Corner rooms, I stayed in 218 and it was very large",3.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-30,"Dear Guest,

OzKayKay,4,,2011-12-31,COUPLES,2012-01-30,3,Clean room and decent breakfast for less than $100,"I booked through hotels.com and got a room for under $100 per night including breakfast, which I thought was a good deal, given LA hotels can be pricey.

The positives: room was clean, bed was comfy and shower was hot. The buffet breakfast was fine, a simple hearty (not healthy) breakfast of waffles, toast, cereal, juice, tea and coffee.

The negatives, its not in Hollywood. Its not near shops or fast food joints, its out of the way. The subway was a couple blocks away which was handy, however it wasn't really that safe late walking back late at night. Staff seemed uninterested, however I expected that, reading other traveller reviews, so was prepared for this.

In short, you get what you pay for, but if you are on a budget and don't mind being out of the way then this place is for you. I wouldn't stay there again, but then again, I don't plan on ever going back to LA!",,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,5

Staff were friendly enough, but didn't provide a lot of insight as to how to get around or provide much advice on the surrounding area..

Location is ok given it's only about a block walk to the metro station to head to Hollywood bvld and universal studios, however there's not really anything much within walking distance of the hotel other than a few restaurants about 7 blocks north on Vermont Ave.

Breakfast at the hotel was included in the cost of the room, however, it was very basic so we didn't bother after a couple of visits. Wasn't great actually!

If you are wanting to stay in Hollywood, I would recommend this hotel as it was fine, clean and the rooms are spacious, but we'll probably opt to stay in Santa Monica on our next visit to be closer to the beach and atmosphere.

The front desk was nothing spectacular but i can't fault them on anything, they were efficient and informative when i requested for directions.

The rooms themselves were clean with the turn-down service was done daily, which lead me to my gripe that there was no in room safe nor do not disturb signage. We had a lovely view of the court yard but wished they provided us some in room slippers so we could make use of the patio without having our feet make contact with the cold floor 

Breakfast was the same everyday, waffles (very well done), sugar coated croissants which ran out quite quickly each day, chicken sausages, and erm artificial tasting eggs. Could have made the selection a little bit more substantial especially if they have guests who stay more than 2 nights it would get a little mundane.

Super close proximity to the metro, basically a short walk through a  somewhat seedy neighbourhood before you arrive in a less than 3minute walk.

Stayed here with boyfriend in a standard room for 4 nights. Room was really nice and had a view of a courtyard. Very clean room and comfortable size with our luggage.

Pool was nice, tucked away behind carpark, and there was a gym.

We didn't have a car, and with hindsight, we should have hired one, but was a bit intimidated driving on first USA trip. We tried to walk to the walk of fame, but it's very far and got a cab instead. The only thing I didn't like about this hotel would be the location, but again- with a car, would be no issue. 

Free buffet hot breakfast was a nice bonus, the waffles were made to order and were delicious, the only funny part was the bus boy kept trying to take bf's plate when he wasn't finished, tried about 4 times straight, but never tried to take mine, I think he was having his own private joke!

We paid less than $100 a night, and for what we got, I would recommend it to people looking to be not quite in the thick of Hollywood, but want a clean hotel nearby. Hire a car!

There was an awesome pizza place less than 10 minutes walk down the street and it was delicious! I'll add if I remember the name",,,,,,,,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-30,"Dear Guest,

We are delighted you chose Hollywood Hotel during your intended visit to Hollywood and the Los Angeles area!  I am sorry your plans changed and had to cancel your reservation.

Many Online Travel Agencies run promotional rates which are special and sometimes offer big discounts off our regular rates.  Since these rates are deeply discounted, they have non-refundable terms and conditions.  We do have rates on our own official website which are refundable, however the refundable rates are not discounted.

I see you are from Palm Springs, the very small resort town in the middle of the wide open desert, and might not be that used to the big city life of Los Angeles.  

If you believe Hollywood is a ghetto, then that's perfectly fine with us.  A ghetto is defined  as a section of a city predominantly occupied by a group who live there, especially because of social, economic, or legal issues.  Some of the people who live within minutes of the hotel in the Hollywood Hills are Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie.  In fact, Brad shops regularly at the local Albertson's grocery store on Hillhurst Avenue which is about a mile from the hotel.  Walt Disney's first studio ( Where Mickey Mouse was born ) was at the corner of Vermont Avenue and Kingswell Avenue and he too lived up the hill from the hotel.  Beware of the rich and famous you just might see one!  The Oscar's are this Sunday...  so we will see many. How horrible is that?    

Dear Tripadvisor Readers,

We do make our guests aware of the different kinds of cancellation policies on our website which state as follows:

1- Reservations and bookings made on a 3rd party (OTA) website or with your travel agent are subject to the terms and conditions of the 3rd party (OTA) website or your travel agent, which may be different than the policies stated on our website.

2- Reservations and bookings made on a 3rd party (OTA) website or with your travel agent can only be canceled or changed on the 3rd party (OTA) website or with your travel agent, which made the original reservation or booking on your behalf.

3- The hotel is contractually restricted from canceling or changing reservations and bookings made with a 3rd party (OTA) website or with your travel agent. The hotel is also contractually restricted from waiving or refunding any penalty or service charges or any other fees you incurred with a 3rd party (OTA) website or with your travel agent.

The good:
We had a car, so the location was fine, and very close to stores and Hollywood. 
Free internet was good, rooms were clean (albeit on the smaller side), and staff were ok. 

The Bad:
The breakfast that was included was very average - I would give it a miss next time if it drops the price of the room. Also, even though many hotels do, I don't think it's right to charge close to $20 a night for parking. 
Finally, the morning after our last night we asked for a wake up call in order to catch our flight. Luckily we also set our alarms because they only called 20 minutes later than we had asked.",,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,,,,10

In the morning, I complained about this sub-par experience, the employees got more brusquely referred me to the general manager, Roman. 

I called Roman, who told me his boss, Jeff, had to be the one to help me.  I called Jeff.  I called him again.  And again.  I called Roman again, who was amazingly rude, said he can't help and transferred me to Jeff's voicemail.  I have now left Roman four messages and Jeff six.

DO NOT GO HERE.  GO ANYWHERE ELSE.  You might get lucky and have a fine experience with this hotel's uncomfortable and antiquated facilities and never need to deal with the management.  But I have never felt so frustrated as a consumer.  It feels like they just keep ignoring me instead of confronting their sub-standard facility.

jim_from_sf,52,"Los Alamos, New Mexico",2011-11-30,COUPLES,2011-12-20,3,"Good location, but rooms small and uncomfortably hot","This was our second time staying at this hotel, and worse than the first experience. We stayed there in early November, and although it was in the 60s outside in the evening, the heating/cooling system was on heat only, and so we could get no cool air. The room was tiny (a queen bed room) and stuffy. The only way to get fresh air was to leave the patio door open, but since our room was on the ground floor, that was a problem. I can't sleep if it's over 60F in the room.
The location is very convenient to the 101 freeway, Hollywood, Studio City, Sunset and Santa Monica Boulevards. Getting anywhere in the LA metro area is relatively easy (for LA).
They do charge extra for parking, but the rate is reasonable for LA, and the parking lot is very secure and well-lit.
There is a breakfast buffet provided and it was actually pretty good. Had to go elsewhere for good coffee, though (my opinion).
Overall, it is a good value, and I would definitely give it 4 stars if the temperature was comfortable.","Get on an upper floor so that you can open the patio door for fresh air. Also, a room facing the interior courtyard is quieter.",5.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,,,,,73

LoveLaughEatLive,40,"Melbourne, Australia",2011-12-31,NONE,2011-12-07,4,Plush Hollywood,"I got a really good deal at $75 a night through Expedia for two persons in a generously sized room with two queen beds, a writing desk, mini fridge, coffee maker, TV (that was too complicated for a TV) and an iron. The bathroom is a good size, but the sink area located right above the toilet bowl with a very tiny space to place toiletries on makes a fumble risky & plain annoying.

Didn't deal with the staff much, as we were out all day, but from the limited interactions I found them pleasant.

Located in downtown Hollywood, a block away from the metro, it wasn't hard getting places (though the public transport in LA is very limited) and it was about a 20min train ride from Hollywood & Universal Studios.

Overall, it is a pleasant hotel to stay at, but not at full price. I can't comment on the breakfast, because although it was included, we never made it to breakfast.",,5.0,4.0,,4.0,5.0,5.0,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-30,"Dear Guest,

Ryan B,7,"Newcastle, United Kingdom",2011-04-30,FRIENDS,2011-12-06,5,California Dreaming,"We travelled to this hotel in April 2011 from the UK, as a group of 3 men aged between 22 and 25. Check in was swift and drama-free and the concierge went out of their way to advise us on local nightlife. The room we were allocated was on the ground floor and 10 yards along the corridor from the main reception. Overall i was delighted with the room. The bathroom was large with a massive walk-in shower and the main part of the room featured two large beds with an ample array of ammenities. There was a small gym and outdoor pool area which were small but surved there purpose. The hotel laid on a free breakfast which although the choice was limited, it was certainly tasty and as it was basically complimentary, u wont be hearing any complaints from me. Cererals, waffles, pancakes, sausage and eggs primarilly made up the daily menu. I've noticed certain reviews on here having a slight dig at the hotel staff. I'd like to tell u from first hand experience that these viscious rumours are nothing short of false propoganda. We were regular visitors to reception whilst grilling the staff on everything from beaches to nightclubs. On each visit we were met with a pleasant smile, foolproof recommendations and pinpoint directions. I believe it was Michael who checked us in and regularly did his utmost to meet our needs, we formed quite a rapport with ""Micky G"" and id like to take this oppurtunity to lavish him with praise. The only slight problem we had was the computer in reception saying as it was constantly occupied but in all fairness this is being severely facetious. Location-wise u couldn't realy ask for any more of a budget hotel. With LA being so vast its impossible to be able to cover all areas in 1 day but The Hollywood Hotel gives u the best opportunity to get around as best you can. We chose not to drive as we found the bus and train service excellent and a matter of 100 yards walk from the hotel entrance. The subway took u straight into Downtown, Central Hollywood and surrounding areas. Santa Monica was easily accessible via a 30 minute bus ride basically along 1 straight road. Whilst previous reports may have labelled the area intimidating or sketchy i have to say i disagree and felt completely at ease. Four nights in a row we returned to the hotel via taxi at 2-3am and the streets were deserted. There was however one night we decided to take a stroll down to a 24 hour subway 200m away and as we entered there appeared to be a group of elderly asian women throwing punches in what was a heated dispute. Swiftly but safely we intervened and used training techniques to subdue and disable the OAP's as we awaited the police to arrive and disperse the handful of onlookers. To show their gratitude we were each given a footlong meatball marinara and went on our way happy as larry. All in all i have to conclude that the Hollywood Hotel is fantastic value for money and provides an exceptional start base to explore Los Angeles. 5 star at a 2 star price",Ask for the ground floor as the room we had was extremely spacious and the bathroom was ample.,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-27,"Dear Guest,

Not our first choice but as we chose to go to LA on the weekend on the All Stars game and week of Oscars, there was not a lot of choice.

The Hotel was centrally located but the rooms were a little dated - the shower entrance was bizarre - my husband only just fitted in through the smallest opening.

Check in was slow and every time we approached the desk, there seemed to be an indeference to our presence.

The breakfast was the MOST awful we have ever encounted!  The eggs were powdered but were made into the shape of fried eggs and they were tasteless.  There was not a lot of choice so we basically had coffee and toast for breakfast each day.

Location was good - short walk to the train and close to Hollywood itself.",,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,,,,,30

crackleviolet,7,"Nottingham, United Kingdom",2011-11-30,FRIENDS,2011-11-19,5,"Excellent value, will visit again!","Earlier this month myself and three friends visited the US for the very first time. We had decided earlier on in the year that we were going to go to LA and wanted to visit the sights but didn't have much money to throw around (poor students), so we browsed sites like Expedia for many months beforehand. In the end we settled on this hotel as for the money it fitted all of our requirements - good location, free breakfast, free wi-fi.

What an amazing decision we made.

First I want to address the point many people on this site have brought up with regards to the dodgy neighbourhood. My friends and I are female and in our early twenties and we NEVER felt threatened by any of the locals, even while walking back from the Metro station in the middle of the night. If anything, we received the most hassle on Hollywood Boulevard and its surrounding area! 

Secondly, about the breakfast buffet. I agree with some of the comments that the buffet is quite small but we never felt disappointed by it. In our group of three was a vegetarian, a carnivore and a vegan and all of us left breakfast feeling satisfied. 

Last off, definitely catch the comedy stand up nights if you can. It's a lot of fun!",,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-27,"Dear Guest,

Galo C,2,"Los Angeles, California",2011-11-30,SOLO,2011-11-14,4,"""service with a smile""","When I desire to get away from the norm of my daily standard living and want to burlesquely masquerade a ""get away"" and treat myself to some outside lodging arrangement, I often choose The Hollywood Hotel. Simply put, it is nearby, clean, friendly, still local and reasonably inexpensive. 

I have been a customer of this hotel for several years now and I almost always recommend it to friends; whom don't wish to embarge on me, and who wish to be in a centralized area of Los Angeles. 

As briefly mentioned, the hotel is local, it's clean and the staff is friendly. If you are looking for a place where the area/neighborhood is superb, then this isn't the place, but if you are looking for a place, such as a hidden little oasis in the rough, then this is it. 

I am always often welcomed by a friendly staff and this time I checked in myself a little early. The day staff is always friendly as well as the evening staff. In all areas and/or department of the hotel. One staff member, in particular, stands out a bit more. The front desk girl, Gisel. She is always friendly, smiling and I was bolstered at the fact that she remembered my name. Great smile, we exchanged some laughs and as always, friendly. I told her I wanted to treat myself to Boiling Crab and she immediately told me of a place up in Hollywood and Normandie that I was unaware of; The Boiling Shrimp. She explained the difference, other than the name of course, was the waiting factor and also the commute. I never knew there was such a place near by. Anywho, I settled in, relaxed a little on my comfy bed and set my way off to eat. Glad I went and glad it was recommended.

The next day I enjoyed myself some complimentary breakfast and went out for a walk. As I returned to my room I ran into the charismatic Gisel again and she inquired about my stay and also my dinner. I told her about it then she began telling me of other places in the vicinity to go eat at. Being a food blogger myself, I was impressed by her knowledge of decent dining spots I myself have also enjoyed.

I went back to my room to an already made bed for me to crash out in and enjoyed the rest of my weekend stay. As I was checking out, the staff, once again, friendly, inquired about my stay and invited me to stay once again. :-) 

This place is highly recommended on my end. Never fails to have me walk out delighted and feel pampered.

Jeff S,82,"Tacoma, Washington",2011-11-30,BUSINESS,2011-11-12,4,It Just Keeps Getting Better,"I have been stayng at this hotel for the last several years when I travel to Los Angeles. The property seems to be improved every time I visit. This year I was given a refurbished room facing the courtyard. The rooms had tile floors with rugs, a microwave and refrigerator, as well as a seperate large room for a closet and storage. The bed is very comfortable and the rooms was spotless. The wi-fi worked well. They have a super pool, however it is unheated so it is really not usable except during the summer. 

They continue to provide a really nice breakfast served in a large well decorated room. It is a nice change from the usual free hotel breakfast chaos.They do charge $18 a day for secured parking which is the norm for the area.

I find the area very walkable and there are a number of nice restaurants on Sunset Blvd which is just a few blocks away from the hotel. It is also pretty centrally located to Hollywood and downtown, however neither are anywhere near in walkable distance.

We found the hotel to be good value for the rate we paid, although the general maintenance and upkeep of the property could do with improving - very dated & tired.

Free wi-fi and free breakfast always a winner! Handily located just up the street to the Metro - just a few stops to downtown Hollywood.

We went downstairs to the bar on one evening, the atmosphere is awful and the bartender seemed too busy playing an instrument next door to care about serving us. He acknowledged we were coming in, said hi and then disappeared for over 10 minutes to play his instrument. Avoid the bar area.

All in all, we were satisified with the hotel, we were able to quickly access Universal Studio and Hollywood Downtown on the Metro and enjoyed many nearby eateries.

ColinandJane,819,"Worcester, United Kingdom",2011-10-31,COUPLES,2011-10-25,4,Nice Hotel - Pity about the minor issues,"We arrived slightly stressed and a bit concerned about the neighbourhood but were warmly welcomed and check in/parking was sorted swiftly.  We had hoped and were given a room over looking the courtyard as this looked nice in the photo's but hadn't appreciated the small scale of it. Plus we shared a balcony with three other rooms (not that we saw anyone) and there was no furniture on the balcony to sit on - or indeed in the courtyard although we were told it was having work done on it.

The room was nicely done out and had a fridge, microwave etc.  Sadly the fridge was noisy at times, also letting the room down was the shower.  Not the pressure/temperature but that the ceiling above the shower/bath was lower than the rest of the room and had access panels with rusty paint around them.  As this was therefore just over my head it wasn't ideal - plus due to the low ceiling the shower head was at face level for me.  

The only other moan would be that one of the ladies (a younger one) on the front desk was not friendly whereas the other lady we delt with and the men were all pleasant and helpful. Breakfast was very good with a good selection of cereal, breads, sausages, weird egg things and waffles.

Parking was $18 a day but was very secure - which leads me to the area.  We were both a little apprehensive when we first ventured out but it was only a percieved ""fear"" as we had no problems even going into the local liquer store and actually feeling fine.  Nice pizza/italian restaurant a block up (Raffallo's) - it looks dodgy but the food and service good.

Ce53,50,"Weston super Mare, United Kingdom",2011-10-31,COUPLES,2011-10-22,4,Nice hotel,"Well appointed bedrooms with very comfy bed.  Nicely decorated with microwave, fridge, and coffee maker.Very noisy extractor in the bathroom which can be annoying.  The reception area and breakfast rooms are spacious and well decorated.  Breakfast was adequate for inclusive, but the same thing every morning.
We found it strange that the hotel didn't seem to have a restaurant and information in the room indicated that you could have food from outside sources delivered to your room. Also the bar was only open on certain days when they then had 'open mike' sessions.  This did not seem to reflect the size and quality of the hotel.
Whatever, we had a good stay, reception staff were helpful and even printed our boarding pass for us.  We didn't have time to use the swimming pool, but it did look very inviting.
Ignore comments about needing a car in LA. This hotel is close to the metro (train) to get to the hollywood sights and close to the metro (bus) stop which will take you directly to Santa Monica pier (calling at Westwood Cemetry to see Marilyn Monroe and others if you're interested).Only costs 1$ 50.  Or you can get downtown to Union Station and go to lots of other places.
The hotel is in a stange location on a busy road with no redeming features,and no other hotels nearby.  Nowhere pleasant or interesting to walk or stroll. However on the corner is a local shopping area with a Rite Aid ((Pharmacy and food store) local bakers - stock up and take a nice picnic lunch with you instead of paying high prices for rubbish elsewhere, and also a Chinese Buffet - eat in or out, a cheap and cheerful (and delicious) evening meal on your way back from a day out.
The hotel was good, if I went again though I would seriously consider staying at a beach area and travelling in to Hollywood.",,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-30,"Dear Guest,

Koops31,27,"Melbourne, Australia",2011-10-31,NONE,2011-10-18,3,A comfortable stay in a not so pleasant area.....,"It may seem weird that I rated my overall stay here as average when quite clearly I was happy with quite a few things. 

Initially on my arrival I was a little concerned as the neighborhood didn't appear to be overly inviting. This was confirmed on the second night when I saw a prostitute on the corner trying to work her magic. It's not a neighborhood I felt comfortable walking around during the evening even in the company of my fiancé. 

Check in was fine & after a long journey from Australia we were able to check in early which was a blessing. However no instructions about 'take a lift to the second floor and your room will be to the right' etc was explained. Small gestures go a long way. The woman that assisted us wasn't overly friendly & not a lot of smiles from day staff at all. In fact when questioning them about directions we weren't even offered a map! The evening staff appeared friendlier and would greet us as passing through the lobby. 

We got to the room and were pleasantly surprised. Whilst being small, it was very clean with a super comfortable bed. Unfortunately there was no in room safe but they do have deposit boxes at the front desk. There is a book with information on local restaurants but nothing on what services are available here such as laundry etc. Our room was on Vermont road side & hence quite noisy with a lot of traffic. I think a room on the courtyard side would have been better. This is why I rated it as a 3, and lack of size. 

Cleaning service is done everyday and without fault. Hopefully the cleaners are made aware of the great jobs they are doing. I rated service as 4 due to the cleaning staff only & not front desk. 

They do offer free wi fi which is super easy to connect to & fast.

They also offer a complimentary breakfast which is totally adequate. Bagels, juice, cereal, toast, eggs, yoghurt & some fruit. Perfect way to kick off your day. 

Now as I mentioned earlier the neighborhood is less desirable. However, it's only minutes away from Hollywood Blvd, Walk of Fame etc. All you do is just jump on the subway a block down for $1.50 or buy a day pass for $5.00. There doesn't appear to be many great choices for dining out however we did find a cute 50s diner a few blocks down. Plus there was a pharmacist/mini mart just around the corner. However just due to our safety feeling compromised I rated it as a 3. 

A little bit of extra goes a long way. Plus I want to be able to walk out the front door, amble down the street & find places to eat. My personal preference :) ",,4.0,4.0,,3.0,3.0,4.0,,,,,10
BrookeS488,2,"Brooklyn, New York",2011-10-31,BUSINESS,2011-10-17,1,RUDE customer Service,"Was very excited to be traveling with our crew for our show to the Los Angeles area. The reviews on line for Hollwood Hotel were great but once we arrived we were all incredibly disappointed with the experience we had there. Our company faxed over credit card info the day we landed. The hotel manager emailed our office production/manger confirmation showing payment the same day However when we checked in 9PM that night the front desk receptionist Devon said there was no payment on file there. 

Our office/production manager back in NY tried to speak with Devon through my cell phone (1AM NY time) but Devon said it was against company policy to talk on a customers cell. She then called him direct. He said there was nothing he could do. The manager was out. 

I offered to put down my credit card just to get the talent checked in since they were beyond exhausted from thier 6AM flight from NYC.  One of the crew offered to put the rest of the crew on his credit card and Devon didn't like his tone and accused him of being ""belligerent."" I was there the whole time and while our crew member was exhausted he did not curse, call names or yell at Devon. He was impatient but that was it and Devon said he was uncomfortable and refused to check us in because the crew guy was ""belligerent."" He called the manager and got him on the phone and said that we were accusing him of sabotaging our travel plans! THAT WAS NEVER SAID. Then because he was uncomfortable he asked permission by the manager to make us wait for another person to check in.  I then offered to deal with Devon and he refused saying that he was ""done with us."" The hotel manager NEVER called our office person back and one week later we are still trying to get in touch with him!!!!!!!

Long story short Devon refused to check us in and the manager approved that. Rather than be subjected to more rude treatment, our office manager made reservations within minutes at the nearby Wilshire Hotel where we were well received. I was billed for the one hour our talent were in their rooms at the Hollywood Hotel which I am still contesting. 

I used to be in the hotel business and I understand that not everyone is going to be a happy customer. But regardless of any cranky customers, it is your job as a concierge or receptionist to give them great service regardless. We were treated horribly and denied service for OUR ""rude"" behavior. Glad to be rid of the place and give someone else our business. 

While I was surprised to receive bad service from the receptionist, I was more so dismayed to get it from the manager of this hotel. I would expect better treatment from someone doing business in an area with heavy production crew traffic.",,1.0,1.0,,,,,hollywoodhotel,General Manager,2011-10-19,"Dear Brooke S

Thank you for choosing Hollywood Hotel during your visit to Hollywood and the Los Angeles Area!

I'm sorry about the misunderstanding about the payment for your rooms.  Due to new Payment Card Industry (PCI) Security Standards, we can no longer accept faxes of credit or debit cards for payment of hotel charges.  In order to check in, the actual plastic payment card needs to be presented and swiped into our systems and authorized with an authorization code by the card issuer.   Our standard confirmation letters clearly explains this procedure and I'm sorry your production office or manager did not read it.

Devon was correct when he stated your reservation was not prepaid and that he needed a credit card to be presented in order to check in each of your crew members.  Once the payment policy was acknowledged by your production manager on the phone and each crew member presented their own credit card, Devon proceeded to check in each guest one by one and they went to their rooms.  The last crew member attempting to check in did refuse to present his credit card or other form of payment, therefore Devon had no choice but to refuse service to the last crew member.  

We are used to normal well-mannered and considerate guests with high standards of proper behavior. In other words, we are ladies and gentlemen serving ladies and gentlemen.

Dear Tripadvisor Readers,

As I have stated in many previous review responses, please travel with your actual credit or debit card in order to check into hotels. Credit Card numbers on a fax or ""my office will call you with a credit card number"" does not work anymore.  Hotels must now follow strict PCI guidelines for the security of all card holders and to prevent fraud. 

If a third party is to pay for your room... no problem we can accommodate you if you email us ( info@hollywoodhotel.net )  at least 48 hours prior to arrival for payment instructions which can be made via paypal or bank wire.

Lastly, be nice to desk clerks, they are just trying to help you have a good time.

If you have any additional questions, please do not hesitate to contact me at jeff@hollywoodhotel.net

Good price - booked through Expedia and got a great rate for fairly last minute. Upon check in the reception staff were extremely rude to the point where they did not even make an effort to greet you. Awful, awful service. They did, however, allow us to check in at 10am when check in isn't normally until 3pm so that was great.
Breakfast was basic but good and was included in the price of the room. Decent size room and very comfortable beds. Bathroom amenities were fabulous (shampoo and conditioner). Very close to the nearest Metro station (about 3 minute walk). Strangely, the hotel didn't have a 'do not disturb' sign for the door so we had to tell housekeeping not to clean the room. They ignored the request and did it anyway which resulted in us actually having to write it down on a piece of paper and attaching it to the door. The room phone wouldn't connect to reception (probably because they didn't want to have to talk to us) or housekeeping or any other hotel phone. The area itself was a bit dodgy but the location of the hotel to the Metro and other LA areas was ideal. This alone would lead me to stay again.",,4.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,,,,,1

We had one queen bed, there was a separate room attached like a dressing room with luggage keepers and a fridge and a microwave. There was also an ironing board and a good iron. The only problem we faced in the room was that it was too cold at night. The temperature controls were not working properly. So that was uncomfortable. Also the wifi was very slow. We called the guy nd he rebooted the gateway but said that if kids played games or people were watching movies it will happen. We did not have kids and we never watched movies but if others in the hotel did, we dont know. 

There was complimentary Hot breakfast included. It was ok too. The only things hot were tea, coffee, decaf, waffles, egg which was made into patties with some kind of a substitute. There was fruit, milk, cereal, toast, jam, cream cheese, juice, cold water and some pita bread with salsa. One day the service was good and next day the new people were rude. Nice breakfast room decor like wineries. 

The location was good, 5 mins to Sunset Blvd which you will definitely see if you are visiting LA, nd other places were near too. The parking is not free, it was $18 every night. The decor of the hotel was very hollywoodish! Nice overall. Their bathroom toileteries are good comparitively so dont worry about that. They give lotion, shampoo, conditioner, mouthwash, bathing mit, soap. All not bad quality. So good. It does get noisy and is not sound protected.

Location was superb for Hollywood and Universal/Griffiths Park (take the metro for these, 100m away) and trips could be booked from hotel reception if desired. The staff were always friendly.

After looking at lots of hotels, we decided on The Hollywood Hotel due to the price being so good and it being fairly close by to where we needed/wanted to be.

After a long flight from the UK, we checked in with no problems, the staff were not super friendly but nice enough.
The room was quite small, basic but efficient, it has a double bed, tv, bathroom, small balcony and everything was clean.

Breakfast was served every morning downstairs and it was a nice, quiet room with enough breakfast for everyone staying there.

The hotel is a typical 3 star - clean, good base.

There are two 'tube' stations nearby that will get you anywhere you need to go. We didnt drive and certainly didnt need to. We went on several trips (L.A Stars homes tour, Santa Monica beach etc)

MATTOD122,23,"San Diego, California",2011-09-30,COUPLES,2011-09-24,3,An Interesting Visit...,"I visited the Hollywood Hotel over Labor day weekend this year. The hotel is pretty nice inside with a private fenced parking lot that made me feel pretty secure leaving my car there although they do charge for parking you want to note (I believe $18 a night). The suite we stayed in was fairly large with a mini kitchen, desk, couch. Some of the items in the room are up to date (TV's, refrigerator, desks) but other things like the carpet and AC system seemed a bit outdated. 
I am not a very picky person when it comes to staying places so I was happy with my room, but if you’re looking for something lavish and lush you might want to look around more. You also share a balcony with the room next to you. You get free Wifi which is nice and a free breakfast every morning with a variety of foods. Nothing special but enough to mix it up for a few days. 

My negative experience came with a situation where the night we checked in. Coming in off a redeye flight, my girlfriend and I were anxious to say the least to get to our room. Upon arrival we checked into our suite around 1:30 am. The sink was dripping pretty bad which made it hard to sleep. Looking further into the sink, water was dripping pretty bad all over the place. We needed to get buckets to save the wood from any damage. I called Mike who worked the desk (a extremely nice guy much like almost all the staff) who did as much as he could to help us. The issue could not be fixed until the morning due to no maintenance man. We were able to stop the drip almost fully but still had to empty a few buckets over the night. Like I stated before Im not too picky, but this was obv something I wished to be accommodated somehow for since I was saving the hotel from pretty bad water damage. To make a long story short the manager Roman (refraining from putting a side comment...) basically dodged me for a week of my stay after emails and messages sent. I contacted him 3 times until the day I left I had to just go to his office.  When sitting down he said what can I do for you… I asked him if he got my email (which was very detailed) and he told me he did. I reiterated to Roman that I simply wished for the hotel to waive my parking for my stay and I would have been happy for my troubles. He told me he would waive 2 nights parking and rushed me out his office to tell me that’s all he could do after talking to the GM. Roman was very unfriendly and didn’t apologize once for anything. I decided to talk to the GM since ol Roman really wasn’t doing his job. I spoke with Jeff Zarrinnam who was a very nice guy and did the job Roman was unable to do. He accommodated me in every way and resolved a sticky situation that shouldn’t have even gotten to that point. Thumbs up Jeff thanks for all your help!",,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,,,14

TheHappyCampers93,1,"La Quinta, California",2011-09-30,BUSINESS,2011-09-21,1,Worst hotel experience ever! :(,"I purchased a few nights at this Hotel from Hotels.com. I usually book on my own but when I saw the number listed, thinking it was the hotel, I called. I was not told that I called Hotels.com, but as soon as they asked for a credit card payment, I knew I called the wrong people. Nevertheless I prepaid for the room. My husband had an emergency job in L.A. and we needed a room the very next day. I saw that there were no cancellation fees through Hotel.com but that the hotel would charge a one night penalty if I cancelled. The cancellation time was 4 P.M. on the day that I made the reservation, even though I made it 3 hours later. I was emailed this information after I booked. No big, I wasn't planning on canceling. We have been working in L.A. for quite some time now, traveling from the desert, but the other hotels we usually stay at were booked. It was ""Emmy"" weekend. We thought we'd try this one and if we liked it we might stay again the following week. After all, they offered a breakfast buffet.
  Upon arrival I pulled off of the busy street in front of the parking area just to get a glimpse of the hotel without slowing traffic.. I was quickly, and angrily I might add, directed by the parking attendant to the lobby area. I mouthed the word ""sorry"" to her and pulled up to the lobby as my kids, ages 15 and 16 stated ""geeze mom, you made her mad! And you didn't even do anything!"" I Received a call from my husband at that time and he stated that we needed one less day so go ahead and let the hotel know when you check in later. I told him we prepaid but hopefully there wouldn't be a problem getting that last night back. We still had a few hours before check-in so I told him I would ask them now since I was already there.
   I walked up to the front desk and kindly asked the gentleman there if it was at all possible to stay one less night. I had already booked and was not canceling, just checking to see if it was possible. He stated that it depended, did I book through them or online. I said online, but that it was through hotels.com and they didn't have a change or cancellation policy. I understood that the hotel had a one night cancellation policy but that I wasn't canceling, just changing. He stated that I could change but that that I would still have to pay for the night. There would be no refund. He also told me it was the online service's policy and not the hotel's. If I had a problem with that, it was, in his words: ""too bad, you should have booked through us and not online. Expedia is the problem"". I explained that it wasn't Expedia but hotels.com as previously stated. He said it didn't matter. ""take it up with them"". I called Hotels.com immediately and they stated that they would call the hotel. It was the hotel's policy to charge a one night cancellation fee but that a change fee was not mentioned. It was not their policy but the hotel's. She put me on hold, made the call, and then apologized but the manager said ""No. No refunds."" Ok no big, it was my fault, I called the wrong # and went through with the reservation anyway. I couldn't believe they wouldn't help me but oh well. We would just stay another night and enjoy some more sights around the city with my husband this time, instead of on our own while he was working.. And we would not stay there again. 
  Upon check-in I was informed that there was a $20 parking fee. I was upset that it was not mentioned when I called but Ok I would pay it. I told them that I had requested a queen size rollaway as the person I booked with said there were not any queen beds left but that if I got a king room the hotel would provide a queen rollaway. I asked him if there was a charge, he said ""no Ma'am"". I said, ""Oh because there are no queen beds left""? He said he wasn't sure why but that there was no charge. Great! So I asked the woman at the front desk if the rollaway was requested and still available. She said yes. So I said, ""No charge, correct?"" She said ""$30 a night"". I said I was told there was no charge over the phone with Hotels.com. She stated that I ""should have read the agreement better, Expedia clearly states it on their website."" I stated, yet again, that it was Hotels.com and I called them, I didn't book online. They said no charge. She told me they were wrong. And that I needed to calm down. She acted like I was being irate..:0 it felt like I was in an Adam Sandler movie. I asked to please see a manager. The manager came out and immediately smirked at me.  I am a tall white female, decent looking, decent clothes, decent car outside, clearly native Californian.  There was not one person in sight who did not have an accent. Was this the reason? Was I being discriminated against for being white?  I couldn't find another reason as I was clearly not a rude person. And I was not unkind to the woman employee but merely asked to speak with a manager to talk about this.. The manager had a Russian or Ukranian accent. I dismissed his smirk as though I hadn't seen it, smiled, and, very nicely and calmly,  told him exactly what had happened from the start, about the penalty I was unaware of and now these hidden fees..I said it ""just wasn't fair what was happening and I was starting to feel like there were going to be a lot more hidden fees. Is there something that can be done? I mean, I asked the online web service twice if there were any other charges and they said no. It is just starting to get very uncomfortable and I hadn't even checked in yet before your staff started being rude to me, starting with your employee, Nelson, this morning, telling me that I shouldn't have used an online service anyway. I thought you liked the business from these companies."" He started very condescendingly with asking what my last name is, smirking again, typing on the computer and then stating ""excuse me, (I swear, like I was a dumb blonde) I see you have 4 guests staying in your room but you thought it would be Ok to book a king room? ...Really?""  NOW I started getting upset. ""So you are insulting my intelligence now, after I just explained to you what was stated to me over the phone, expecting a little understanding, now I'm stupid I should have known better."" His response, ""I didn't say you were stupid, just making an observation."" I told him, ""I cannot believe this. I have stayed in hotels all over the world. All different kinds. I have never in my life been treated so rude. Is this how all of your customers are treated?"" I told him to forget it, I wasn't staying here. It was obviously only going to get worse. I couldn't believe it. He immediately said he would cancel for me and to ""have a nice day"".  Ugh
  I just want anyone who is thinking of booking at this hotel to know how they are. I would have liked to read a situation like this for myself, then I would have shopped around a little better. 
  If you are planning on staying at this hotel, book directly with them, and ask about fees. And be warned, the hotel may seem decent, if you don't look at the stains on the couch in the lobby or water stains all over the ceiling, but the staff are very rude. At least at the front desk. And in the parking area.. The location is not actually right in Hollywood but closer to Los Feliz area and not the nice part.. The area is not the greatest although the outside of the hotel is well maintained and clean. And if you plan on spending time in Hollywood, you will have to drive a little. It is not within walking distance. Unless you are OK with walking a few miles. The eateries around there seem cute, there is a 50's diner and some other family places but I wouldn't advise being out walking at night. At least not around there. Hollywood Blvd. is better lit with more people. Hope this has helped at least some of you.",,3.0,1.0,,3.0,,2.0,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2017-10-12,"Dear Guest...

Breakfast was great but get there early! We went down about 10am one day and it was so busy but everyone complaining and taking all the fruit!!!
Pool was lovely and relaxing
Close to metro and buses
small shop in hotel, laundry room 

Bad Points
We had no hot water for 2 days due to maintainence - this wasnt conveyed to us and no compensation was offered
Staff are OK but not exactly informative 
Internet is good when it works but when it breaks no one knew what to do
The downstairs bar is not relaxing - there is always a comedy show on which isnt very funny - in fact its actually quite tasteless. They could make it so much better

This is very convenient as its less than 5 minutes walk to the Metro which takes you to all the main tourist places in Hollywood. Reception staff are really friendly and helpful and our room was ready even though we arrived mid morning. Room was spacious and bed was very big and comfortable. Breakfast is very good too- plenty of it and enough variety. The swimming pool is a decent size with a nice sunbathing area. The area around the hotel is fine- a good few restaurants of different types and some shops. I certainly didn't feel unsafe at all. Interested to find the HQ of the Church of Scientology just around the corner. This hotel was really good value for money and I would certainly stay there again. Only downside was that our keycard kept failing and we had to keep going to reception to get it recharged. This would have been very irritating had we been staying longer. Also- watch out for the taxi drivers- they try to steal each others custom-we paid the deposit at the hotel for one taxi firm and another turned up pretending to be them-when we got to the airport they claimed we hadn't paid the deposit at the hotel-so we ended up paying twice.,,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-27,"Dear Guest,

It is relatively easy to find just off highway 101. It is close to the Metro so you don’t need to drive to the Walk of Fame on Hollywood Blvd or Universal Studios. The hotel has good vegetation around it that makes it look good.

I got a large and comfortable room on the ground floor. It was a bit noisy next to the back entrance with the elevator opposite, but not too noisy that I failed to sleep. The room is well equipped with closet and kitchen area. The room had an iron and board, microwave oven, refrigerator, and safe. There is a coffee make but it makes only a single cup of coffee. There were ample towels and toiletries. There was a flat panel TV with options to pay for movie rental.

The pool outside is quite large and surrounded by more lush vegetation. The exercise room is small but has a good selection of equipment. 

The breakfast included in the room rate is moderately good.

Thank you for choosing Hollywood Hotel during your visit to Los Angeles. We know you have many hotels to choose from and we love you chose us.

Thanks so much for letting me know about the a/c in your room and I'm sorry it was not working at it's optimum performance.  Our maintenance crew inspected the a/c fan coil unit in your room and it turns out the chilled water control valve was stuck, preventing or only allowing a small amount of chilled water from flowing thru the coil, making the unit not cool to it's optimum cooling output. We had the part in stock and our maintenance crew changed it out quickly.  We also installed a new digital thermostat in the room as well.
 
The explanation of ""Temperate Climates"" makes as much sense to me as it does to you... which is no sense.  If you can remember who gave you this term as an explanation at the front desk, I will have to give them little re-training in A/C lingo. 
 
Again, thanks so much for reaching out and letting me know which room to focus on ... Albeit after you checked out.
 
If you have any additional questions, please do not hesitate to contact me at jeff@hollywoodhotel.net

Mary F,1,"Nashville, Tennessee",2011-07-31,FAMILY,2011-07-15,4,We stay there every year and think it's fine.,"This hotel provides very dependable services.  One thing we have noticed is that the staff has very little turnover from year to year...always a good sign for any business.  The breakfast in the dining room downstairs is consistently good--about the same thing every day, but enough choices to satisfy any reasonable person.  The eggs look a little strange(they look more like pancakes..we checked the ingredients..looked okay to us)  but are tasty'  They have added fresh fruit since the first year we stayed there and this is a welcomed addition.  The pool is very pleasant (if a bit cool some days) and appears to be very well kept and the pool area is private and attractive.  The rooms vary quite a bit in size, shape and details, but all have been fine.  Those with larger bathrooms that include a tub/shower combination are the best in our opinion.  Those with only a shower are a little small if you are staying very long, or have a lot of bathroom ""stuff"" to put out on the counter.  The beds are wonderful and we sleep better than on our own beds at home.  The most important part of the bed is that the coverings are all washable...and seem exceptionally clean...which is a high priority with us.There are lots of good pillows in varying sizes and degrees of firmness. The television service is not exceptional, but who wants to watch a lot of TV in LA, and the heating/cooling system (at least in our room) was quite noisy. This serves as good ""white noise"" at night, so not such a bad thing, but the hotel has always been quiet and peaceful with no noisy groups in our experience.  It seems to be popular with families and particularly Europeans, we have noticed.  It is almost a rarity to hear English spoken in the dining room, where we encounter the most people.   The hotel is located near two Metro stops, so it's possible to navigate much of the city without a car. There is an assortment of restaurants within walking distance  and a good drugstore just down the street.  Two major medical centers are very close in case there is an illness or other emergency. We have always felt safe there and just take normal precautions when we are out at night, as in any big city.","Website info about the room choice is confusing...we suggest you call instead, or read the choices carefully.",5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-30,"Dear Guest,

whitneyuk,74,"Birmingham, United Kingdom",2010-11-30,FAMILY,2011-07-15,4,Nice Hotel!,"I visited this hotel late last year. To be honest with you I was unsure about this hotel but because it was in the right location I decided to go with it.  There was a lot of talk on here that it was not in a good area. This hotel is near hospitals and the area is safe. It is between two subways station - one around 5 minutes walk at the most the other is around 15 minuite walk,  which is very handy for those without a car. We had a car so it wasn't an issue. This hotel is not actually right in the centre of Hollywood, it is around 5-10 minuites drive at the most from the centre of Hollywood.  There is a carpark at the hotel but it is expensive. We just parked on the road at the side of the hotel. You need to read the sign because one day in the week they clean the road in the early morning and the road must be cleared. All you do is park on the opposite side for that one morning. 
Now comments on the hotel itself.... There was a guy on the reception that was lovely, his name was Peter, he was so helpful and it was nice to come across someone like that when you've travelled thousands of miles. However,  not all the staff are that nice. The Manager there I found very off hand and unfriendly, it was same with the girl who worked on the reception desk from time to time. Had I spoken to them on my first night there I would have been very upset.  The rooms there are very nice and spacious, I cannot fault them. They cleaned the rooms every day and the cleaners were very nice. Breakfast... do not expect any thing fantastic! The breakfast is very basic and never varied. Everyday they had waffles. To be honest with you half way through the holiday I just got tired of what they served and ended up skippping it altogether. Having said that most hotels in Hollywood offer room only so you could say its better than nothing! However, I thought nothing was better!!!  To sum up what I think is that the hotel itself is very nice, the staff need more training in smiling and basic customer service - with the exception of that lovely guy called Peter of course, and the breakfast isn't worth getting out of bed for!",,5.0,3.0,5.0,,,5.0,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-30,"Dear Guest,

STAY AWAY FROM THIS HOTEL!",Make sure the AC works.,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,3.0,hollywoodhotel,General Manager,2011-07-07,"Dear Dbmt_01

Thank you for choosing Hollywood Hotel during your visit to Los Angeles and for responding to our guest survey.

I'm sorry you had a ""terrible experience"" while staying at the hotel.

I did pull up your booking you entered and made yourself using the Synxis booking engine on our website. I emailed you a copy of your original booking for you to carefully review again.

As you can see, you made your booking for 1 night only, not 2 nights as you have stated in the guest survey, and on TripAdvisor. 

On check in your key card was programmed for your length of stay which was only 1 night. Our key cards automatically deactivate at 12 noon as our obligation is ended at that time. We did not ""lock you out."" 

Automatic key card deactivation is customary in all hotels which have electronic locks.  This prevents a checked out guest from entering the same room which is rented to a new guest, which Dbmt_01 was apparently mistakenly trying to do.

Since the housekeeper only found your used toiletries in the room and your room status was a check out, we can only conclude you either forgot to take your toiletries or you abandoned the toiletries which many guests do on check out. Nevertheless, we put whatever belongings we find in a checked out room into lost and found until we hear from guests. We hold the lost and found items for 90 days and if unclaimed after 90 days donate them to charity. We certainly did not ""rob your toiletries"" as you stated. Your statement is nonsense. Had you left clothes in the closet, suitcases, bags, etc in the room, that would have been different and was not the case.

Dear TripAdvisor readers, please double check your reservation confirmation arrival and departure dates and make sure they are accurate.  Luckily when Dbmt_01 returned to the hotel late in the evening, we had just received an email from a guest that their flight was canceled and would arrive the following day freeing up a room for Dbmt_01 to check into for a 2nd night as we were sold out that night.

Many guests email us to reconfirm their bookings with us which is a smart thing to do. If you would like me to reconfirm your booking reservation, please email me at jeff@HollywoodHotel.net with your first and last name and your arrival and departure dates and confirmation #.

Our goal is to have happy guests on arrival and on departure so you will recommend us to others.

Bob, you shuld be careful on how you talk to guests in the hotel. You are very rude !!!!",,,,,,,,hollywoodhotel,General Manager,2011-07-30,"Dear Marty077_11

Thank you for staying at Hollywood Hotel during your stay in Los Angeles. We know you have many hotels to choose from and we appreciate your business.

I'm sorry you thought Bobby was rude to you.  Apparently, during your 4 day stay, you were asking every front desk clerk during every shift of every day for extra soap, shampoo bottles, lotion bottles, mouthwash, ..... and you didn't stop there, you also asked the housekeepers everyday for extra bath amenity items as well.  The entire front desk crew found this behavior to be a little abnormal and Bobby just could not resist asking you... what's up with that?  

..... but I think I know why .... as I did a lot of research for the best hotel amenity products I could find and discovered them in the Italian designer brand Poggesi.   Pogessi is best Long known for its exquisite Italian linens and Poggesi brings a fresh approach to excellence in the bath and boudoir. Unisex Cocomango Bath Amenities invigorate and inflame the senses with sweet, high notes of orange, cocomango and citrus. Most hotel bath amenity products are in 1oz bottles, however our Pogessi amenity products are in 2oz bottles!  I know .... these products are hard to resist to those with excellent sense of smell.... like you.

After you checked out, the housekeeper found one of our laundry bags 3/4 filled up with our bath amenity products left behind in your room.  I guess you found it too heavy to take all the way back to Australia. Sorry about that.

Dear Tripadvisor Readers,

If you really enjoy our bath products, as I'm sure you will, and would like more, please do not hesitate to email me at jeff@hollywoodhotel.net and I will ship you a case of any bath product to you at our cost plus shipping and handling.

We also caught the bus as well and this was the same distance to the train station.

We had booked the hotel using a prepaid travel money card and when we arrived to check in the hotel advised they do not accept this as payment - depsite accepting it when we booked!!!!

I spoke to the Manager and his response was find another way to pay or go to another hotel!!!!! All our money was on the card and we had our very tired 18 month old son with us - after a screaming match payment was finally accepted. The front desk staff member laughed during the heated conversation and could not have cared less!!

The staff here are VERY RUDE, UNHELPFUL and I would not recommend anyone staying here.

The hotel is also located in a very unsafe part of Hollywood - dozens of homeless people walking around and all are very aggressive.

Thank you for choosing Hollywood Hotel during your visit to Los Angeles.  We know you have many hotel choices and we appreciate your business.

I'm sorry your Travelex Mastercard was not authorizing during registration.  Travelex seems to have very strict security guidelines to prevent fraudulent uses of their cards, especially when used in foreign countries.  I strongly advise all travelers to notify their credit, debit or charge card companies of your plans to travel to a foreign country and your travel dates.  There will be much less chance of encountering an authorization issue in the foreign country you are planning to visit.  

The only matches I'm interested in playing is an occasional tennis match with guests in Griffith Park.  I'm not interested in ""screaming matches"" as this guests states and I did not say ""go to another hotel."" I sell rooms for a living and directing a guest to another hotel would be going against my business ethics... and is just not part of my vocabulary.  

The guests charge card was accepted after we helped him place a long distance call to his charge card fraud department in Australia to lift the security hold after he verified his credentials with them.  I'm sorry for the inconvenience, but an unauthorized credit, debit or charge card is just a piece of plastic with numbers on it.  Only valid authorized cards can be used for payment.

Dear Tripadvisor readers, if you have any additional questions regarding the use or authorization of your credit, debit, charge card, please do not hesitate to contact me in advance of your arrival at jeff@hollywoodhotel.net . 

Our goal at Hollywood Hotel is to have Happy guests.

Yes, Griffith Park and The Griffith Observatory is the most popular tourist attraction in Los Angeles located on Mount Hollywood with fantastic views of the Hollywood Sign.  We are the closest hotel to Griffith Park, Griffith Observatory and The Greek Theatre!  The park, observatory and theatre are located straight up Vermont Avenue and there is a Free shuttle which can take you straight to it from the hotel.

Thank you for choosing Hollywood Hotel during your visit to Los Angeles.  We know you have many hotel choices and we appreciate your business.

Thank you for complimenting our large rooms, large shower and comfortable Sealy Posturepedic Beds.  We do charge $18 plus 10% tax for parking in a secured gated lot with 24/7 parking attendant.  All hotels charge for parking in LA and we are probably the hotel that charges the least. For more information about our parking, please visit our website.  By the way, did you enjoy our complimentary hot buffet breakfast from 6:30am to 10:30am?

We are a pet friendly hotel and accept dogs and cats, however there is a $35 per day pet fee.  There is ample open space for your pet to do their business in our numerous flower and tree beds and garden.  A little extra fertilizer won't hurt them! 

I'm sure all hotel rates in New Mexico are less than the hotel rates in Los Angeles since an acre of land in New Mexico costs about the same as a 10 square feet of land in Hollywood.  The reason you didn't choose a national name brand hotel in Hollywood is because they charge twice as much as we do and give less value.  By the way, The Hollywood Hotel brand  has been ""Internationally Famous"" for over a hundred years, unlike the nationally recognized cookie cutter hotel brands.

Breeze68,1,"Venice, Italy",2011-05-31,COUPLES,2011-05-26,1,Not safe - lack of service.  Left ground floor sliding doors open all day.,"Let me start by saying that we rely on hotel reviews in selecting where to stay when travelling and we have been very grateful to all who have contributed.  The Hollywood hotel had reasonable reviews and we stayed there recently for 6 nights on our round the world trip.   We were given a ground floor room at the end of a corridor which was very noisey, the hard marble floor and main street outlook did not lend them selves to a peaceful sleep. We had recently stayed in a hotel in Union Square in San Francisco so the mix of homelss and night people was not a surprise. 

Around the middle of our stay we returned to our room at approx 10pm to find that the ground floor sliding doors had been left open.  We had not opened them at all during our stay. We telephoned reception immediately to report the situation.  The guy on reception could not have cared less.His response ""What would you like me to do about it?""  I calmly explained the situation.  He repeated what he had said before and did not ask anything about the room or if anything was missing.  He would however email the hotel management to let them know. I was gobsmacked at his attitude and lack of empathy.  WE COULD HAVE LOST EVERYTHING.   

The next morning we asked reception for an update, the receptionist said that she would contact the director of housekeeping but we could not change our room to an upper floor till later that afternoon.   We wanted to leave.  We were not very happy and requested no more room service.  Reluctantly as we had an early start we deceided to remain and lock our luggage to the furniture as we had an early start to Disneyland.   We returned to find out that room service had visited despite our request not to.

The Hotel management have not even got back to us, they don't listen or seem to care.  We have travelled all around the world (Cairo, Luxor, Morocco, Bangkok, Singapore, Hong Kong, Ho Ghi Minh City, Brisbane, Auckland, San Francisco, Las Vegas, New York, London) staying in rooms no bigger than a double bed in Hong Kong to the Wynn in Las Vegas and in all of them big or small cheap or expensive you expect a level of service and security.  I am afraid that both are very lacking at this hotel in abundance.  

No Hotel management response during our stay. We would not stay here again or recommend to anyone else to do so either.",Do not stay here,,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,hollywoodhotel,General Manager,2011-06-03,"Dear Breeze68

Thank you for choosing Hollywood Hotel during your visit to Los Angeles and spending the time to write a review about your experience.  The cast and I know you have any  many hotel choices and we appreciate your business.

I'm sorry to learn your private balcony sliding door was left open.  Our housekeepers are trained to lock the main door and the balcony doors when they have completed cleaning a guest room. It's impossible to determine who opened a balcony door.  I did reach out to you and sent you a private message via your screen name to learn your name or room # and dates of stay so I could research who you spoke with at the front front desk.   I apologize, however I did not receive any message regarding your open door from my staff nor did I receive a message or email from you.  You were here for 6 days and likewise I'm astonished you neglected to contact me directly for something so important to you during your time at the hotel.

I am a little puzzled how you could ""lock your luggage to the furniture"". Is that even possible? 

I do not understand how you could label the hotel as ""Not Safe"".  Your review is actually a testament of how safe the hotel really is!  The  review title could have been written as follows: 

VERY SAFE HOTEL: LEFT BALCONY DOOR OPEN ALL DAY AND GOBSMACKINGLY NOTHING WAS MISSING!

I guess it's a question of is ""My Glass is Half Empty"" or ""My Glass is Half Full"".

Your round the world trip sounds very exciting and I'm surprised you have not left any reviews of your round the world experiences and what you have done so far.  Most Tripadvisor readers, like me, like to know the positives of a trip... what to do, where to go, what you liked, and of course.... what was gobsmackingly exciting about the trip!

If you can find a good rate and get a room facing the parking lot, it is very good value. Breakfast was fine and filling (granted, we only stayed two days), the pool area was pleasant, and our room was quiet, clean, and very roomy. We will definitely be staying again. Children's Hospital is walking distance, saving on parking and the 12 check-out time is generous.

jems4,3,"Brisbane, Australia",2011-05-31,FAMILY,2011-05-21,2,overpriced and over rated.,"Stayed here for 2 nights and that was too long.  They didn't accept our Travelex card for payment, whereas every other hotel had been happy to accept it. We have two children so we wanted to drop our luggage off and then head off to Universal Studios.  We didn't get back to our room until about 9pm.  When our son tried to go for a shower we found we couldn't adjust the temperature as the handle was broken.  We called reception expecting that someone would come fairly quickly, but we had to phone again over half an hour later by which time we'd had to shower our kids with cold water as they just couldn't stay awake any longer. Also the shower was so small,we could barely turn around, it didn't seem clean and the shower nozzle was so low we couldn't wash our hair.  The next morning we asked them to fix the shower and I told them we'd had to put up with cold showers but got absolutely no recognition that this mattered.  When running a so called up market establishment we would expect prompt service, a warm shower that was usable and to feel that every customer was important.  After travelling from Australia we were tired and not having a clean, usable shower was extremely disappointing especially considering the high price of our room.  Would never recommend this hotel or stay there again.",,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,hollywoodhotel,General Manager,2011-06-18,"Dear Jems4

Thank you for choosing Hollywood Hotel during your visit to Los Angeles and taking the time to write a review.  We know you have many hotel choices to choose from and we appreciate your business.

We do accept Travelex Mastercards, however Travelex seems to have very strict security and fraud alert systems in place to prevent unauthorized usage.  We could not authorize your Travelex Card which is the only reason we could not accept it.  An unauthorized credit, debit or charge card is invalid for us to receive payment and I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

Dear Tripadvisor readers, if you are traveling out of your country and wish to use your credit, debit or charge card, please inform your credit, debit or charge card company ahead of time of the countries you intend to visit and your dates of travel.  This way, the card company will lift the security measures for the countries you are visiting.  We have seen increased denial authorizations for security reasons from Travelex cards than from any other card.  The security denial can be activated even after you have used your card a few times in the US.

Our showers can be a little tricky for some guests to use.  Some of our showers require the user to pull the handle toward them, then turn the handle right or left to adjust the hot and cold water temperature.  The handles are labeled with ""PULL"" but sometimes guests do not see it.  When our maintenance staff inspect the showers while the guest is away, they find the shower working normally as it should and leave.   

Dear Tripadvisor Reader, Every guest is very important to us and we wish every guest to have a happy experience while staying with us. We want you to LOVE us so you recommend us to others.  If you feel, you are not getting the service or attention you believe you should receive while in the hotel, please pick up your room phone and dial my extension 431 or email me at jeff@hollywoodhotel.net.  I have many special qualities but I cannot read your minds like Harry Houdini ! There is absolutely no reason why any guest should leave my hotel unhappy and disappointed.

suelikesblue,27,,2011-05-31,SOLO,2011-05-20,2,So creepy.,"I had to check in around midnight because my flight got delayed.  I was given the key to my room, and when I tried to open the door, the chain was on.  Yup.  Meaning that SOMEONE ELSE WAS IN THAT ROOM.  That's probably one of the worst mistakes that can be made during a midnight check in, no?

When I went back to the front desk, he started to explain it and then just trailed off.  My new room was empty, luckily.  But it was tiny: a queen bed, a small desk and a wooden chair.  Oh, and a large cement balcony with no furniture that faced a really gross street with drug-addled people walking by.  Charming!  Two of the lights didn't work, and while it didn't seem actually dirty, it just felt... wrong.  Creepy.  

I went to the vending machine to get some water, and while it was completely sold out, I did find a note saying, ""Meet in the lobby at 1am for a very exciting game of Hide and Seek..."" 

So... I wandered back to my room, looking over my shoulder the whole time, and basically just rocked myself to sleep.  The next morning I gathered my belongings and explained to the woman at the front desk that I wished to check out immediately (four days early).  She didn't seem surprised in the least.

I gave it two stars because there wasn't blood or mold or bodily fluids or anything truly disgusting about the room.  But I think the room was probably worth about $15, rather than $100, plus $18 a day for parking.

Thank you for choosing Hollywood Hotel during your visit to Los Angeles. We know you have many hotels to choose from and we appreciate your business. 

Thank you for spending the time to write a review and emailing me direct about your stay.  As you stated in your email your disappointment started when you were checking out and "" the front desk lady refused to manually put through our credit card.""  

I asked the lady, Giselle,  who checked you out and she is equally disappointed in the misunderstanding. She was trying to explain to you that your credit card magnetic swipe was read by our system perfectly, except your credit card company was not authorizing your charges and was asking for another card.

Your insistence of telling her to manually input your credit card numbers into our computer system would not have made a difference. To reduce credit card fraud, the credit card companies policy is for hotel merchants to only accept credit / debit cards which can be magnetically swiped thru a magnetic card reader.  Since we follow PCI compliance guidelines and cannot imprint or store credit card numbers, we thus cannot ""manually input"" credit cards into our system. I am very sorry for your frustration, however we must follow credit card policies set by the credit card companies.

Please be aware that an unauthorized credit card does not necessarily signify any non payment of your credit card statements or that you are over your limit. 9 times out of 10 if a credit card is not authorizing the reason is your credit card has put a preemptive security or fraud alert on your card. This usually happens when there is something unusual happening with a cardholder spending habit or history.  

Most likely, your Australian credit card company put a security hold on your card when a charge was trying to be authorized in the United States. The same thing happened to me when I was vacationing in Paris last November and trying to check out of my hotel last November. I had to call my credit card company in the US and they asked me all kinds of questions to prove to them that it was in fact me making these charges. 

I understand you were ""disgruntled"" while all this was happening but the front desk lady did offer to store your luggage in our back office since our guest luggage storage room was already full. We have many, many Aussies staying with us and we are all sensitive to your very early arrival times into LAX and your very late departure times out of LAX. We will definitely store your luggage on arrival until your room is available and ready and we will store your luggage after you check out and are ready to depart to the airport. At times, we are storing so much luggage that we have to use my office!

Giselle and I are very sorry for the misunderstanding and hope you will consider staying with us the next time you visit LA. I understand you and your wife are newlyweds. Congratulations!

Malibu_1636,26,"Victoria, Canada",2011-05-31,FRIENDS,2011-05-17,5,What an amazing vacation!,"Hollywood Hotel was great! The price we paid was exceptionally reasonable and the room was awesome! We arrived early and check-in was a breeze. Since we were staying for an extended amount of time, the very kind Michael G (Front Desk) made sure we had a nice room on the 3rd floor for our comfort. (P.S. He was very helpful and knowledgeable).

Room: Clean and spacious

Location: Not the best in L.A. (did not feel safe at night walking about but that`s not the hotel`s fault). However, the Metro Station is super close to the hotel which made transportation very easy and cheap. We found our way around pretty easy. 

Cleanliness: Very clean

Service: Front Desk was always available whenever we needed to ask a question. They recommended restaurants nearby, tours we could take and nearest subway stations. 

Value: Amazing value for money (a lot better than expected)

Sleep Quality: The beds are SUPER comfortable! Did not hear ""ambulances"" and ""fire trucks"" like some people have complained about in other posts (and we had a city view).

The free WI-FI internet was AWESOME! Made our travel plans much easier when we could Google things quickly. The breakfast was great. Just what we needed to get our day started. It was quick and efficient. We could go in, grab a quick bite and head out straight away instead of waiting in pesky restaurants in the early A.M. We did not get a chance to use the pool/sauna facilities but it looked lovely.

- Good selection of buffet breakfast with good cold and hot meals
- Wifi high speed internet
- The hotel has a sauna and a pool if you want to use

Lisa J,15,,2011-05-31,SOLO,2011-05-09,4,Very nice hotel,"I really enjoyed my stay at the Hollywood Hotel. 
The Pro's:
1) Breakfast buffet. Scrambled eggs, sausage, waffles, cereal (cheerios, rice crispy & corn flakes) Milk, Lemonade, Orange Juice. Toast (very varieties of bread) Coffee (Only powdered creamer & milk) sugar & sweetener plus fruits. The times from 6:30 to 10:30 is perfect. 
2) I loved my double queen room. The one slight change I would make would be to move the sofa away from the microwave and refrigerator. The coffee pot they have in the room holds a single cup. You cannot see the TV from there. The bathroom is spacious to me. Be very careful of walking into as you turn the water on. The hot water takes about 4 to 5 minutes to heat up. I was impressed that they use low flow toilets. I didn't have a single problem with it. The sink and counter is laid out perfectly but in room 312 (that I was in) the faucet would make a loud noise when you turned it on full blast. I did have a balcony with room for me to chill out there but twice there was a couple of smokers outside smoking even though there are a lot of signs that say there is no smoking inside the hotel.
3) I loved having a daily LA Times at the Concierge Desk.    
Cons:
1) The pool is nice but it is not heated. I suggested that they would make it heated because that water was frigid when it was 80 degrees outside. I would suggest a jacuzzi. 
2) A double edge sword would be that the hotel is very close to two buses & the red line but at night, I would not walk back to the hotel by yourself and I have a black belt in karate. 

A few things about your public transportation available to you.

The Red Line will get you to Downtown LA & up to North Hollywood.

The 704 will take you to Santa Monica but it will take you about one hour to get there.
http://www.metro.net/riding_metro/bus_overview/images/704.pdf

I would definitely recommend getting a rental car if possible. I had one for a full day & was able to go to Santa Monica, Venice and Malibu w/o having to take forever to get there. The public transportation is getting better. Self parking costs $18 a day at the hotel. Street parking is free from 8pm to 8am. You are about 1 & 1/2 blocks away from Sunset Strip. Bring walking shoes, as well. LA is flat but if you want to make sure you are in comfortable shoes if you are walking (I used my sketchers, which was fine). If you go to the beaches remember to bring a light jacket because it does get breezy in those areas. I would recommend that you park on the side of the roads if you go to the beach. There is several paid parking available but the free parking is just across the street. 

There is a bank of america near but I couldn't find it. Rite Aid, Chinese Food & Mexican Food is within walking distance..

Overall, it was a nice hotel but a few slight changes could make it even better.",Room 312 has a view.,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-30,"Dear Guest,

LauraTraveler215,3,,2011-04-30,FRIENDS,2011-05-02,3,3 stars for what?! ... The last level,"I would not say that they really lie, but just by omition... They show you the beautiful entrance, but this is parking side, so when you are looking for this hotel, look at the name, and not an hotel with a beautiful fountain, you could not find it!
On google in the description, they say ""luxury hotel"", and you know that's a 3 stars, so when you see the price, you say, yes ok!... But... luxury bedrooms are for the last level with a great view!
Wait! The best is now, friday night we didn't have any warm water!! For medical reasons, I needed 2 warm bath a day, and I couldn't friday... THIS was inacceptable from a ""Luxury Hotel""!
Hopefully, they have a great breakfast, with a pretty dinning room, the microwave and the fridge in the bedroom, it was awesome to have them! And the the situation of the hotel was great too, really close to the red line station, but the neighbourhood does not let you feel secure...
If you're looking for an hotel who has a great location, that's this one but don't have any big expectations...

Sarah2809,63,"Ullenhall, United Kingdom",2011-04-30,FAMILY,2011-04-27,4,Great value for money,"My family and I stayed here for 3 nights over Easter. The hotel is located in North Hollywood. The rooms were spacious, quiet and very clean. The check in staff were very friendly and helpful especially when I had trouble printing my boarding cards, Cynthia printed them for me and made me feel like nothing was a problem. 
The children loved the breakfast as freshly made waffles were on the menu everyday as was sausages, eggs, cereal, cold meats and much more.
The chap in the gift shop looked a bit miserable but in fact was totally the opposite he was very funny and extremely knowledgeable about the area. There are plenty of trips on offer in reception if you have forgot to book any like Disneyland.
The restaurant isn't open on Mondays or Tuesdays and when we called to order food in, most restaurants don't deliver after 9.30 except Domino's pizza, which the kids were fine with. There is a small shop opposite the hotel where you can get Wine, Beer and snacks from if after a long day you need a long cold drink.
My only gripe was that I thought the hotel was closer to Universal Studios, it wasn't and cost $28 each way.
We didn't use the subway or go out wandering in the evening as we were all tired after long hours of site seeing.",,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-30,"Dear Guest,

Christinak84,44,"Birmingham, United Kingdom",2011-04-30,FRIENDS,2011-04-25,4,A fantastic stay - exactly what we needed! Don't listen to the negative people.,"First of all, I was a little skeptical after reading some reviews. However we had an amazing stay. The hotel was exactly what we needed it for – it was clean and the room was quiet at night for much needed sleep after exploring everyday. I never found anyone at the front desk rude, in fact everyone was so friendly, polite and helpful. I asked for a print out of a map pretty much everyday (sent it to their email) and they were more than happy to print out my information. I think if you are nice, then you will be treated accordingly. 

Maid service everyday was great – our room was clean and we had fresh towels every day and clean sheets every 2/3 days. Our room was quiet and I didn’t have any trouble sleeping. I, in fact, called up and requested a room on the 3rd floor that didn’t face the street so I covered my back before we ventured out there. I did this 2 days before we flew out. 

We didn’t venture to the pool as it was a little cold so I can’t speak for that. Breakfast was OK – if you like bagels, waffles and fruit then it’s all good. The eggs and sausages were a little dull after a few days – especially as the eggs were just like little discs of scrambled egg. Would have been great to get a bit of variety going…however, I did get a little *too* over excited when I found English muffins in the bagel tray one morning! 

Overall, we didn’t spend too much time in hotel and even though it’s nowhere near anything, the metro is 3 mins walk away and so easy. $6 all day travel. And only around $15 cab ride from downtown. The homeless issue that people have brought up is everywhere in LA – and although it’s not nice, it’s not just this area and we were not really hassled that much – we were hassled more in central Hollywood. 

If you want a clean room, comfortable beds, adequate breakfast and a good deal – definitely venture there. You will hardly be in he hotel anyway as there is so much to see in LA. I’d go back right now if I could!

GoGaz,1,"Swindon, United Kingdom",2011-04-30,COUPLES,2011-04-23,3,A reasonably priced hotel near the Metro and bus routes - great for LA’s main attractions.,"If you’re looking for a reasonably priced hotel close to public transport and within easy reach of the main Los Angeles attractions by Underground Metro or Bus – this is the hotel for you.  A five minute walk from the hotel takes you to the Metro Red Line and a number of bus stops – meaning Universal Studios, the Walk of Fame, Downtown LA and set-off points for Beverly Hills tours are all less than 30 minutes away. The hotel staff won’t tell you this – but they will sell you expensive, time-constrained tours to your desired destinations.

The Hollywood Hotel (formally a Ramada) boasts that its ‘an ultramodern Hollywood Hotel is 21st century living at its finest. Decorated with luxuriant European designs and laden with cutting edge technology.’ This might have been true five years ago, but is now sadly not the case. The hotel is clean and spacious, offers wireless internet (a must for planning your trips out) and has everything you need for a week’s stay. But, it’s approaching its ‘best before’ date. Our standard room, whilst very clean, showed signs of ageing paintwork, walls, and carpets whilst the bathroom showed the first stages of mould on the tiles. The bed was very comfortable with lovely pillows – although the annoying heavy bedspreads slid off at night. They were cleaning the hall carpets during our stay, but continued to use the noisy machinery into the evening. 

The room had a very large chest of drawers with an old, huge TV in top. A hanging rail is supplied in place of a wardrobe, but with very few hangars. Tea and coffee are provided – one decaf and one normal per day – not enough if there are two of you in the room. And, as there is no room service or cafe at the hotel, you’ll need to ask for more if you like your own hot drinks. Vending machines are on all floors for cold drinks and snacks. A low-noise fridge was great for keeping drinks cold. 

Our balcony was very pleasant, although there are no chairs to sit on outside. The pool area (just across the hotel car park) was a surprise. Nice pool, pleasant gardens and clean towels. 

For some reason the lift (elevator) is very, very, very slow. Be prepared to wait!

A continental Breakfast is served from 6.30 in the morning – great if you have a full day planned. And there’s something for everyone. The hot selection has sausages, eggs (bizarre omelette/pancake-like creations) and freshly-made waffles. There’s a good selection of cereals and breads. The coffee is good for hotel coffee. Fruit (get it before the cut apples and bananas go brown); cheese, spam (yes spam!), yoghurt all made an appearance in the week – although not all were there all the time. They are catering for large numbers – so it may be a case of the early bird catches the selection.

It’s obvious that this hotel is very popular – it was fully booked whilst we were there. And with a focus on volume, it’s easy to understand why the staff may be indifferent to you. Michael G checked us in – he was helpful, polite and genuinely looked pleased to see us. But it was all downhill from this point – as his other colleagues were much less enthusiastic. The chamber maid was delightful and always seemed happy at her work – although she started early. On a number of occasions we returned to our room after breakfast to find it being cleaned. Very annoying if you plan your ablutions, etc before leaving for your day out – as you have to wait for her to finish.

This is a great hotel for those who plan to spend their time out as its one of a small number of hotels near to the Metro. So for this reason alone, its location may make it worthy of top marks. However, take this out of the equation and the score drops somewhat.",Call the hotel before arriving.,4.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,,,,,0
Greenie21,18,"Manchester, United Kingdom",2011-04-30,SOLO,2011-04-19,4,Enjoyable stay,"I was a bit wary of staying in this area, but with the Metro station half a block away, it proved a good choice for me. I wouldn't like to be in this area without that - it seemed a bit scary, but I left the hotel, went into the Metro, and that was fine. However, Hollywood is like that all over these days, I understand. Inside, the hotel is fine and I felt safe.
They put me in a recently refurbished room, which I found very comfortable and clean. No evidence of bugs or anything untoward, and after reading recent reviews, I checked carefully. It all seemed very clean to me.
The standard of help on the desk was varied, but usually I got a lot of help and some hints about places to visit, etc. The Internet is free and worked well for me. The microwave and fridge in the room were very useful. The breakfast was good, a choice between hot and cold, and there were no restrictions.",,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-30,"Dear Guest,

She was not helpful and was pretty rude.  How could a hotel not have a bell boy? We were expected to drag our suitcases to the storage room and to and from our hotel room. The description on the website was misleading about the hotel's location.  It is not near anything touristy at all. Loads of homeless people around (we could see them from our hotel window, which was spooky).

Most staff were very friendly and helpful (Michel G. for instance), but unfortunately some were not interested at all.

We asked for directions by public transport, but the answer from her was to get a taxi!  And when we said we would still like to use public transport, she looked at me as though I cannot afford a taxi!

While attempting to print boarding passes, we were having some difficulty, and the lady at the front desk acted like she could not be bothered. Her instructions were to attach our boarding passes to an email and she would print them. I happy to say, I'm pretty tech savvy, but I just could not figure out how she wanted this to happen, and quite frankly she wasn't too concerned. It was literally like talking to the desk..not the person behind the desk, but the actual desk. 
What do ya say... we just get a printer for that area? Ok paper is expensive, hook up a printer and just turn it on when boarding passes are needed. This was my only, albeit major complaint.

Also overcharge for parking in the lot!",,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,hollywoodhotel,General Manager,2011-03-24,"Dear Felishia,

Thank you for spending the time to write a review about the Hollywood Hotel. I know you had many hotels to choose from and the entire hotel cast appreciates your business. I also wish you had spent a little time to inform me or a front desk service agent about any feeling of unhappiness you might have experienced. We all strive to have happy guests at the Hollywood Hotel and the entire hotel cast feels terrible you had an unpleasant experience.

There are many fine dining restaurant within a few blocks and within walking distance of the hotel.  The front desk service agents have a list of all the fine restaurants for all tastes in the neighborhood and they could have pointed you in the right direction.  I see you are from Edmonton, Canada which is the northernmost North American metropolitan city with just over a million people.  I actually have friends from Edmonton, and they tell me it's very cold up there in the summer and in the winter don't even think about going outside.  Sounds like a very inhospitable place for a homeless person with it being so cold and all and there is a good chance you have not even seen a homeless person in Edmonton.  Metro Los Angeles has a population of about 10 million people and we are in Southern California. It's warm down here and its a hospitable  climate to be in if one is homeless and chances are you will see a homeless person while visiting LA no matter were one goes in LA or Beverly Hills for that matter.  Reminds me of that movie - Down and Out in Beverly Hills.  

The City of Los Angeles has a Class 1 rated Fire Department which includes very quick responding paramedic ambulances.  99% of the sirens one hears in LA is from paramedic ambulances. With the notorious LA traffic, the ambulance sirens are loud so the drivers in cars can hear them to get out of the way.  With a population of 10 million someone is always needing medical assistance, so one is going to hear ambulance sirens no matter where one stays in LA. The guest room windows are double paned which reduce the noise significantly but not 100%.

Now the ""sewer smell"" in the bathroom is an unusual one and one I have not heard before from a guest.  I wish you would have reported it to the front desk or called me  as I would have investigated that right away. Unfortunately, I don't know who you are or what room you stayed in but I would like to know so I can check this ""smell"" myself.  If you read this, please email me at jeff@HollywoodHotel.net.

We charge for parking as all hotels do in Los Angeles. It's normal to pay for parking in Los Angeles and it should not have been a surprise, since it is stated everywhere.  Our parking rates are actually one of the lowest rates around if one does a simple comparison. 

Again, thank you for writing a review and I hope you enjoyed the complimentary hot buffet breakfast served daily from 6:30am -10:30am, the free wifi service with 24/7 tech support, the complimentary in room coffee, free fitness center, pool, free newspaper, the free comedy shows Wednesday - Saturday, the free business center with free printing or your in room fridge and microwave, 37"" LCD Television.

Incredibly... Our central heating system is working perfectly fine.   If it was not, I would have had many guest complaints these past few weeks as it has been unusually chilly in LA.  I'm sorry I did not receive a call or voice message or email from you while you were here that your heater was not working. We would have turned it on for you.

Your statement that we charge for Wifi and TV is absolute nonsense.  We have FREE WiFi everywhere in the hotel including ALL guest rooms, lobby, bar, lounge, restaurant, meeting rooms, courtyard and even the pool area. We also have FREE 24/7 professional wifi technical support in the event a guest needs help connecting to the wifi system.

 We have 37"" LCD TV's in our guest rooms with free programming with about 40 channels.   We do have a pay per view movie system if you would like to watch first run Hollywood movies which are still in movie theaters like all fine hotels do.

We feel that our lounge with complimentary comedy nights and breakfasts are very important to adding to the experience of our guests. We try our hardest to deliver good hospitality, and we sincerely hope you will give us another try.

Thanks to Tripadvisor we found this great hotel !!! To begin with this is not a luxurious hotel. It is a very pleasant hotel at a great prices that offers numerous extras !! When we pulled up to the hotel we where extremely disappointed with the area, and actually worried, the fenced in parking lot was not a good sign for us., You do have to pay quiet  a bit for parking here at this hotel !! After we checked in and drove a few blocks north to same great restaurants,( Go to Freds 62 down the street for amazing food at great prices !!!!!!! ) We started to really enjoy the area and the closeness to many attractions and things to do. The hotel offered lots of wonderful amenities; workout room, pool, a great hot breakfast with wonderful waffles, and assortment of hot and cold foods. On Friday night they offered a free comedian down in their bar..wow what a nice touch. The rooms where nice with microwave, fridge, and a coffee maker in the room, The beds where nice and comfortable and the rooms where quiet. They have redone the rooms, what I do not understand is why they would have not completely remodeled the bathrooms instead of just partially and why they would not get new wallpaper and drapes in the rooms. But over all this is a great hotel for the location. The staff was super helpful. The elevator was scary. I am big stairs person so this was not an issue, but I would stay clear of the elevator!!

AusBeagle,54,"Sydney, Australia",2011-02-28,COUPLES,2011-02-14,3,Not walking distance to anything,"The hotel sounds on the website as if it's close to lots of attractions...and in terms of miles it is...but it's not walking distance from anywhere and the traffic is so bad in the area (and dangerous) that even driving 4 miles takes half an hour. Also the local neighborhood is very dodgy and dangerous, I wouldn't walk outside anyway.

Booked through their website on a rate reduction due to staying more than a night and didn't get the rate advertised when I was charged - they then charged exorbitant taxes ( about 4 different taxes in all per night - far more than anywhere else in California charged) to justify the cost so it ended up being the rack rate anyway.

Room was nice; bathroom and shower were good. Parking at $18 a day plus tax was a rort given there was nothing really in the area to justify that price and it was just outdoor self parking.

Buffet breakfast was reasonable but cleanliness and freshness of some of the food/utensils was a bit questionable. Good for an included breakfast.

We went to San Fransisco too and then came back here. From the moment we arrived the staff were helping us out. I needed a quiet space to interview someone for our project, no trouble, a room was immediately found. When one of our locations feel through for filming, the hotel quickly stepped up to help us out. All the staff on the front desk and in management were smart and smiling. We have parcels delivered, left stuff in their care while we went to Frisco, used the hotel as a location, as for all sorts of contacts and recommendations for services. This hotel was perfect for us. Affordable on a lower budget, smart staff that could help with unusual or singular requests, just off Hollywood's main drag, clean, and everything worked.

BHappynow,266,"Orlando, Florida",2011-01-31,BUSINESS,2011-02-04,5,Great stay but somewhat far from Downtown,"I didn't have time to see much of the area but enjoyed staying here while attending the 2011 CHA Winter conference, 6.49 miles from downtown.  The Metro is 2 blocks toward downtown, and is $1.50/ride.  My advise is to start before the 7am traffic of commuters. I got off at 7th and took another route to Convention Center.  All in all, had no problem getting rides from others I knew or traveled other ways. 
  The breakfast was delicious.  Their fresh crossant pastries, and waffles were baked for you, early and all during the service so very tasty!  Eggs and sausage, 3 cereals, coffee, tea, bagels, bread, but not much fruit, were the fare.  Served from 6:30am most days and 7am Sundays.  Also, the frig in the room kept our waters cold and great for leftovers!!
 We were changed after the first night, due to wanting a tub, so ask if that is a preference!!  Every room I saw was very clean, great mattresses and new linens! It was a pleasure to stay here and the staff are just gems in the hospitality service.
If you are not driving, then this may be a bit far of a commute to the Downtown center.  The area seemed safe and the people friendly.  Would definately stay here again!",,,,,,,,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-27,"Dear Guest,

Nice, large bathroom.  Free wifi that works ok, not great.  Nice LCD TV, fridge and microwave in room. All in all, a good value for the price (under $100).

The quibbles: Chilly front desk woman greeted me upon arrival and never once cracked a smile. The hotel is located in a so-so section of N. Vermont, (try and get a rear room since Vermont is noisy) so you pay $18/day for secure parking. It's nice to also have a complimentary breakfast buffet served in a full sized dining room, however, the eggs are nasty (they look like yellow coasters) but cereal, juice and coffee hit the spot. Also, there's no in-room safe, a standard item in most 3* hotels.

Vinny614,16,"Burnaby, Canada",2011-01-31,BUSINESS,2011-02-01,3,So-so,"Hotel itself was ok, owned by Ramada group.  The staff sucked, the lady at the front desk was kind of rude and did not even smile.  I was put at a quiet corner room, which was ok until I found out they were renovating the stairs and painting.  The maintenance guy had a key card and before knocking he just barged in to my room.  Thankfully I was just unpacking that time.  After that had happened I tried to call down to front desk which had a busy tone for 30 mins.  Finally I had to go out so I went downstairs to talk to front desk.  This is when I found out why there was busy tones. The people there were chatting and when the phone had rang, they just press the busy button.  I've asked to switch rooms but they said they had a full house.  I've also asked for nobody to do room service, but they ended up coming anyways.  Nobody seems to listen.

Now for the brighter side of things.  It's only a block away from Metro train and some great rapid lines to West hollywood area.  The red line is great, it intersects with lots most of the lines.  1-2 block away you will find great take out, Mexican take out, Chinese was good ( I'm Chinese). Subway if you want something familiar.  Being from Vancouver, our taste buds are very picky because Vancouver is food Heaven.. (this is take out we are comparing)

The breakfast Buffet has good sausages and eggs.  Also has cereal, bagels, toast and fruit.  They have a waffle iron, but nobody to make them. 

So it was a great location, ok place, bad service. Would've been better if I got a smile, and no guy barging in my room (he probably wanted to use the bathroom)",,3.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,6

The location is excellent - close to public transport, and a few things to look / eat at around even though the area isn't too pricey.
While I was given a room for disabled users by luck, it was very very big.
On the other hand, the cleanliness of the toilets and the bath area was borderline good - some marks were left on the towels, and a bit of mould on the shower (not bath).
The staff at reception were just about civil - saying anything to them (including checking in) made me feel like I was disturbing them. Although they didn't have a problem with my leaving my luggage in their office 3 hours before check-in time.
Fairly decent choice of food at breakfast, which was served until quite late in the morning.
There was also little separation between the ground floor corridor (where my room was) and the reception, so I felt a little close to where most of the traffic and noise was, but this turned out not to be as noisy as I feared.

We are in Hollywood and we are The Hollywood Hotel. Hollywood is supposed to be different ..... Not Ordinary....and that's why people all over the world want to come to the most famous place on the planet - Hollywood.

Yes, our ADA rooms are big... Very big and I'm glad you enjoyed your room. We did an extra deep, deep clean and scrubbing on all the bathroom tiles in all the ADA, so if there was any mildew, it's gone now.  Thank you so much for pointing this out.  In 2 weeks we will be changing our laundry detergents to commercial grade brands Tide, Clorox, & Downey which have been proven to clean better than the leading detergent brand for hotels in the market today.

I got well acquainted with the metro system as well. if anyone is looking to get to sunset strip, hop on the 2 express, which is just a  hop, skip and a jump away at sunset blvd and north vermont.the subway system is located here as well and is very easy to understand. it took me about 5 minutes, once on the metro, to get to the chinese theatre. anyhow, this hotel superceeded my expectations by far, and i would highly recommend it.",,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,hollywoodhotel,General Manager,2011-01-05,"Dear LauraNY_10

Thank you so much for your perfect review... The Perfect Choice.  I think it's the perfect title for a review!

Good for you being a walker. Walking on foot is one of the best ways to see Hollywood and if you ever get tired just take the metro or a DASH shuttle back to hotel. The metro station is across the street and the DASH Shuttle stops in front of the hotel. 

Did you know Hollywood also has some of the best hiking trails in the city. Griffith Park is the largest city park in the country and it has many beautiful trails including trails to the top of mount Hollywood and to the top of Mount Lee where the Hollywood Sign is.  I try to hike every Sunday morning, so if any hotel guest would like to join me on a Sunday hike, just send me an email and I would be delighted  to give you my .25 cent hiking tour of Hollywood. I saw Woody Harrelson just last week hiking down as I was hiking uphill in Runyon Canyon.

Jeff S,82,"Tacoma, Washington",2010-11-30,BUSINESS,2010-11-26,4,Once Again A Great Hotel,"I stayed at this hotel for a week on business. This is the third time I have stayed here and the first time since it changed from a Ramada property. This hotel continues to be an excellent value. The internet (free) works well and the free hot breakfast is very nice. The breakfast is served in an actual restaurant with plenty of room to sit and relax, unlike most hotels were there is never room to sit.

The hotel is not in the best area, but then there really is no best area of Hollywood. While I didn't have a problem walking around, some people who are not used to large cities may be uncomfortable. It is in a good location as far as being centrally located and close to the Hollywood freeway. However, if you don't know L.A. be aware the traffic can be terrible; be prepared to spend lots of time in traffic if you have to travel during the rush hours.

They do charge $18 a day for parking but have a large secured lot so you don't have to worry about your car. The rooms are nice and room service does a good job. If there is anything to complain about I guess it is slow elevators but that really is not a big deal. I had no problem with the front desk staff as other reviewers have, but then I only dealt with them to check in and check out.

If you get a chance check out the Alcove Bakery (1929 Hillhurst). They serve breakfast, lunch and dinner and have wonderful desserts. It is close by (not within walking distance) and has great outdoor heated seating. 

Overall this is THE place to stay, in less you want to stay at a five star hotel and shell out several hundered dollars a night in Hollywood.",,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-30,"Dear Guest,

thelawsons_nz,207,,2010-09-30,FAMILY,2010-10-28,4,Great value for LA - more than meets the eye!),"This hotel has made the best of its location and is great value for its price range. 
We were checked in by Michael who was friendly, helpful and welcoming.  Our room (Standard Queen) was clean and comfortable.  Only complaint was that it was slightly dimly lit – no ceiling lights and only a couple of lamps around the room, and the bed was a little soft.  You can get a bit of street noise from busy Vermont Blvd, so if you are a light sleeper I suggesting asking for a room that faces the back carpark & pool area.
We chose to stay here as it was in the middle of all the attractions we wanted to see and they could accomodate the group we were travelling with (extended family).  It’s a couple of blocks from the US-101 which makes getting around easy (if you have a car) and it is also located between 2 Metro stations on Vermont.  The restaurant, bar and pool area are all very well appointed with marble floors and comfortable furniture.  The pool is private and set amongst a nice garden.  There is ample parking and the wireless internet was good as they have several modems throughout the hotel.  Breakfast was basic, but it was free so couldn’t complain.  There are a few places to eat within walking distance (McDonalds, Wendys, Dennys etc).  
Would recommend this hotel for short stays in Los Angeles for people who are looking for a comfortable hotel in a central location to base themselves from.

Ems_Hame,56,"Auckland, New Zealand",2010-10-31,COUPLES,2010-10-20,5,Excellent Value for Money,"I stayed in this hotel for 2 nights with my husband and what a wonderful stay we had. I had read some of the reviews and wasn't sure what to expect, but from the moment we checked in to the time we left, it was fantastic!!
I had screwed up the booking but the 2 men at the front desk were helpful and had us checked in, in no time. The free breakfast each morning was delicious and kept us going well past lunch time.
The room was new, with a nice flat screen TV.  I had requested a quiet room not overlooking a busy road and that's exactly what they gave us, so sleeping at night was peaceful and restful. I couldn't hear any of the people in the rooms next to us or in the hallway and I am a light sleeper.
The parking was USD$18.00 a day, but for downtown LA, I thought that was reasonably. The carpark is in a gated secure area, so well worth to pay and have your car looked after.
We would definately make this our hotel of choice when staying in LA again.",,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,hollywoodhotel,General Manager,2010-11-27,"Dear Ems_Hame,

While staying here the hotel had a power outage in part of the building and claimed that the utility was at fault as opposed to fessing up and getting the electrical service repaired.  

Initially they claimed they would credit for my and my colleagues stay due to the inconvenience yet then later did not honor that as another desk clerk was there.

Thank you, Thank you, Thank you.

I'm sorry you did not receive a room with a bath as most of our rooms have bath/shower combinations. Since you were staying 7 nights we could have switched you to a room with a bath....had we known your preference.  Yes, Taxis can be expensive in LA since LA is so big and getting to your destination can take some time. On the other hand, we have a metro station across from the hotel which will take you to most places and we have a bus stop directly in front of the hotel as well. There is also a DASH shuttle which does a full Hollywood loop for only 25 cents.... So there are other options. 

The front desk has free maps of the city and will provide a custom google map printout  with directions from the hotel to anywhere in the city just for the asking.

Probably a good thing as we didn't think it was that close to universal, maybe it is if you have a car. However it is very close to the metro that will get you there in about 10 minutes. The hotel itself was very nice with good rooms and free wifi. It may just have been us being paranoid but we found the area after dark to be a bit scary. However we felt that way about most of LA. I wouldn't recommend the bus tour that they can send you on, it didn't stop enough for our liking and perhaps if we hadn't have been so lazy we'd have tried to find another one. The pool is private and looked nice but we never used it as there were too many sites we wanted to see. The metro system is awsome although a lot of crazy people seem to use it. We got all the way down long beach for $3 which is a bargain, again though passing through compton was scary, think i've been watching too much boyz in the hood!!",,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,hollywoodhotel,General Manager,2010-11-27,"Dear Gadgt69,

Thank you, Thank you, Thank you.

I'm glad you got to use our metro system! Our hotel is one of about 5 hotels in the entire city which is conveniently located  across from a metro station. So getting to downtown Los Angeles, Staples Center, Nokia Live, LA Convention Center, Disney Music Hall, Universal Studios, Hollywood Walk of Fame, Kodak Theatre, Pantages Theatre can literally viewed as being in walking distance of the hotel.... And in your case even Long Beach! Wow.  Extensions to the Red Line are underway to take passengers to Santa Monica Beach!

Norcalcouple89,1,,2010-07-31,NONE,2010-09-16,5,Made our Wedding extremely Memorable,"This hotel made our wedding extremely memorable. It is so very difficult to find a location in Los Angeles that is affordable for a nice classic wedding. Downtown LA is waaay to loud. And everywhere else is way to far for our guests to enjoy. This Hotel is in the perfect location for our guests (we had a lot of friends and family from out of town who flew in). They have a metro station on both sides of the hotel, walking distance, that takes you straight to Universal Studios. It is surrounded by great cafes and sights and attractions. Our guests LOVED their stay here, the rooms are so clean, modern, and roomy. And the service was just outstanding. 
   Now, our wedding was unbelievable. Mandy took care of us 100%. We were kind of nervous since the prices were so affordable we didn't know what could happen that day. EVERYONE loved our appetizers and cleaned their plates. I can't say enough about this hotel it is such a diamond in the ruff for a wonderful affordable wedding. Mandy checked us into our suite and brought us appetizers from the cocktail hour (we wanted to wait to make our entrance). HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend this hotel for your wedding.  
   The only thing I say to be aware of, parking is a bit pricy but once you pay your car and belongings are carefully watched by security within a gated parking lot. (very important in LA) and lastly , their bartender is a little mean. I am sure you have to be strict as a bartender but I think he took his job wat to seriously for my guests liking....he can smile a bit more =)",,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-27,"Dear Guest,

I was pleasantly surprised at the attention to detail in the decor--more tasteful than some hotels at a much higher rate. The room was truly lovely, nice perimetier tiles on the floor and a nice carpet where the bed was, and an ample size, with sliding glass doors.  It didn't have any of that slight ""ick"" feeling you can get from some hotel rooms.  The bathroom was nice and they even included a luffa pad. With the lush plants around the exterior it, all in all, made for a cheerful place to come home to and wake up in for 4 nights.  The pool seemed nice though I didn't have time to use it.  The front desk staff was really helpful and the hotel is well-situated for jumping onto Santa Monica, Sunset, and Hollywood Blvds., and is a straight shot right up to Griffith Park.  I went to a concert at the Hollywood Bowl and it only took me 15 minutes to get there; coming home from the House of Blues another night took about 20 minutes. Going to Disney Concert Hall took about 10-15 mintues, same for getting to Rodeo Drive.  Getting to Malibu was about 30.  Of course, I stayed off of rush-hour freeways. I paid for hotel parking so as not to have to look around for a spot.  I hadn't realized a full breakfast was included--even with freshly made waffles while you wait--so I didn't feel too bad about paying for parking.  This hotel is a really a great find! I would absolutely return there and recommend this hotel highly.  The neighborhood isn't high-end but that's the case with a lot of sections of LA.  I never felt unsafe and it was always a pleasant vibe and I found a great deli across from the Wendy's (same side of the street as Wendy's, across a little driveway) which had really fresh and good humous and salads and soups--took stuff to go a couple of times.  Right across from the hotel was a place that sold alkaline bottled water that I really enjoyed drinking the whole time I was on this trip. So it's not like the neighborhood had nothing to offer.

Alex,68,,2010-08-31,COUPLES,2010-08-27,4,Not the most stylish hotel in Hollywood as the motto says but a good quality hotel,"This is the second time I have stayed at this hotel and my feelings are he same. This former Ramada Hotel (left the franchise to save costs) has some of the rooms of a higher quality indeed (not the ones you get half-price though) and then other rooms which have not seen refurbishment yet and are a bit dated, yet spacious, with terrace and sofa in the room, microwave, coffee/tea facilities. To be honest, unless you are prepared to pay 4 star quality at over 100 dollars/night, there isn't much choice in Hollywood. Hollywood is a contrast of poverty and wealth and the affordable hotels happen to be near tube stations, in areas to be questioned. if you want a fantastic hotel in the middle of the action then choose the Hollywood Highland (Rennaissance) at double the price. At the Hollywood Hotel I found the service great, the cleaning done well, a small size pool (15 m/5 m max) a gym the size of a room, with no windows and poor airing, but looked after. Their staff make the best of what they have got. The hotel is well connected by bus/tube and the tube ticket for the day is 6 dollars (works on buses and tube). 
Breakfast, ok this is REAL POOR - no choice whatsoever of teas and coffees (one of each), only two waffle machines and you will get to queue for them, eggs looks ill and there is only one type of sausage, no other meat. The choice is really poor and I would not call anything they offer ""healthy eating"", but it is eatable. 
Careful with the tube: although you never seem to see any control whatsoever, and 9 times out of 10 you can travel without paying, there is occasional control especially in the centre of LA at some of the exits. And so you need to know this: in Hollywood ONE SINGLE TICKET PAYS for ONE tube line journey ONLY, so if you need to change tube lines (move from red to blue for example) in order to reach your destination, you need to buy another ticket.... VERY STUPID and certainly not good for tourism, but tourism is very poor here anyway. BUT I saw people being caught unaware and had to pay fines, so best is to get the 6 dollars travelcard.
CAREFUL with your wallets and belongings - the city is FULL of prostitution (especially on the Hollywood Boulevard) and really dodgy people, so watch out for your stuff.
Carry an ID with you at all times as some of the bars/restaurants will ask for proof of over 21 and even if you look 45 they will STILL ask you for ID.
On Hollywood Blvd I would recommend Dillans Irish Pub for food as it is affordable and well looked after, gorgeous waitresses and good quality food. There isn't much of affordable healthy choice on this boulevard, but at the opposite end there is Hooters for ex and then the Hollywood Highland shopping centre which has a couple of pricey but very good restaurants.
Shopping wise - strongly recommend he Glendale Shopping Centre - you can reach this centre by bus from Hollywood blvd (30 mins journey) - great food, proper mall.
Careful with Compton and Crenshaw and Inglewood - STAY AWAY! at least 2 shootings/day in these areas so if you can avoid them like plague DO SO!!!!! The projects are just the same as the ones you see in movies - stick with North, North east, west hollywood and beverly hills.
For those who think of going to attractions - the beach is about 1 hour by bus from this hotel (Santa Monica blvd) and Universal Studios a couple of tube stops away).",,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-30,"Dear Guest,

sharmst,5,,2010-08-31,FAMILY,2010-08-25,3,Not a great hotel,"Stayed here for 3 nights  and used it as a base for universal and an LA tour.
The price was very reasonable. However the location was not great. 2 blocks up and would have been fine ( location, location ..)
When I booked it was as a ramada hotel, not 100% sure if it is now.
The staff were helpful and friendly. However the operation all seemed a bit strange. You could only access the basement ( where the OK breakfast was) via one lift which was a bit painful. There was a bar downstairs but that appeared to be a one man operation and when we tried to go and have a drink the lift had been locked for that floor as the barman hadn't turned up.
You were only allowed 2 coffees in your room per day and as I used the creamers they wouldn't/didn't replace the coffee packs.
There was also a notice in the hotel information asking guests to advise the staff should they see rats/mice etc. A big turnoff.
Hotel : Please employ more staff at breakfast time. There only appeared to be 2 people and whilst they tried to do a good job there is far too much for them to do.

Anyway, I’m sure some things might have changed since we were there (it was then a Ramada), but many things in my review are still relevant I’m sure, such as the location.  We just wanted a decent place to come back to after long days of exploring.  We stayed 8 nights and did a ridiculous amount of activities (Hollywood Blvd, Grauman’s Chinese Theater, Rodeo Drive, went to Marilyn Monroe’s house in Brentwood, Dodgers game, San Diego Padres game, San Diego Zoo, Universal Studios, Disneyland, Coachella Festival in Indio near Palm Springs, Gwen Stefani show at Universal Ampitheater, Warner Bros studio tour, Sony Pictures Studio tour, Santa Monica Pier, Venice Beach)  and a lot of driving, and found that this location was great for everything close by in the Hollywood area, and not bad for things farther away since we were close to the highway.  We were gone all day, every day.  When we stayed a free breakfast was included and that was nice for us, it wasn’t the highest quality breakfast ever, but it was decent and it was a great start to our long days.  I can’t remember having any problems at this hotel…everything went fine, the room was clean.  There are a lot of Denny's restaurants close by, we would eat lunch there sometimes.  If you are like us and are going to L.A. to site see and explore, and are going to have a rental car, this is a good home base at a GREAT price.",,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,,,59

This was absolutely fine for 2, but we found that the room was a little cramped and there wasn't a great deal of space for 2 large suitcases.

The breakfast buffet (included in the room price) had a great selection and we made the most of this every morning to set ourselves up for the day, on the waffles, sausages, eggs, toast, bagels, fruit......

The immediate area around the hotel is not really ideal, but since we had hired a car, this allowed us to get around very easily. The hotel is very well situated.

We are all very excited about Giselle's newborn and he is due any moment. Yes, it's a boy! and we, and I am sure 99.99% of Tripadvisor readers, forgive him for his little kicks in mommy's stomach which made her uncomfortable sometimes when mommy was taliking to and helping hotel guests at the front desk.

teeejaay,2,,2010-08-31,SOLO,2010-08-19,5,What a nice surprise!,"I stayed here for one night of august 17.  After reading the reviews below, I was really apprehensive about the hotel.  But, I was pleasantly surprised!  I really don't know where some of these people who wrote the bad reviews could be coming from...
I arrived @ 1:30 and asked if early check-in was possible.  Gizelle, one of the two young women working the day shift, said a room would be ready shortly.  I took a seat in the lobby and started giving it a good look - since I had time on my hands and was trying to see what was wrong with it.  I saw beautiful marble floors, very tasteful lobby furniture and accessories decorating the area.  Three rolling luggage racks on the ready for people to load their luggage onto (don't know what that one reviewer was saying when she said she had to lug her bags around!).
They have a separate desk to the corner where you can rent a car.
Now, on to the Customer Service.  Gizelle couldn't have been nicer and more accomodating. (Bad customer service on previous reviews...could it have been the guest who was unaccomodating, huh? lol) And you should have heard some of the questions that the traveling nincompoops were asking of her and her co-worker (!).  I wouldn't have been so patience.  LOLL  How many times did they have to tell that one guy that it was the 4 and the 8 bus to Santa Monica.??  (3).  Oh, there was a pretty Russian lady co-worker who was also very nice, giving directions ad nauseum, etc).
Gizelle got me my room at 2:30 and I checked in.
The Room was recently renovated and very well thought out, too.  Good designers they had.  Tile floors throughout with an area rug under the bed - very nice.  I especially love tile because it can be santized between guests.  The room had a queen bed, nightstands, alarm clock, bureau, arm chair, desk w/keyboard for Internet and a flat screen LCD T.V.  Con: It was a little difficult to maneuver around the channels on the remote and I almost hit a BUY button by mistake.  So watch your channel surfing.
On to the closet area with iron and ironing board and also a safe for your cash, laptop and family jewels.  There was an adjacent area for Fridge, micro and coffee maker.  The bathroom was spacious and again all in tile even the walls. There was no tub but people shouldn't be coming to southern California and wasting so much water to fill a bathtub anyway.  Conservation is the way to go!  Get with the program tourists, please? Bravo to the hotel for thinking ahead!
The bathroom was stocked with all the amenities even toothpaste and a shoe shine sponge.Good thing because I forgot my toothpaste.  Thanks, guys!
Towels were plush and folded beautifully.  Kudos to the housekeeping staff.  I did not see anything untoward and believe me,  I checked!!!
Open the patio door to a small balcony overlooking a quiet courtyard.  Suggestion: They could use a small cafe set to sit at out there for your morning coffee.  How about it Management?  Would be a nice touch. :-)
Obviously you can see I loved my room.  It was just very comforting to walk in and see how it shined.
In the evening, I took my book down to the pool and enjoyed the families  having fun.  Met some very nice people from France.
Next morning, I took in the Free breakfast.  Let's see, coffee, tea, milk, orange juice, cereals, fruit, toast, eggs, saugage and waffles made to order.  All for free.  I don't understand how anyone could complain  about a free breakfast but previous reviewers did.  
One thing could be better about the breakfast - coffee was too weak but hey, it was FREE so I'm not really complaining.
One more con is the location if you are the type that likes to walk everywhere.  I felt very safe in the hotel and grounds but the street was a bit iffy at night as others have said. During the day it is fine to take mass transit.
One last thing, the parking situation.  One big PLUS is the fact they even have a parking lot!!!  This is for all you whiners before me who complained about the $18 charge per day to park.  I didn't bat an eye because I was just glad they had one and it is gated with an attendant.  I originally checked the Roosevelt Hotel for $300 a night, as a treat, but they only had valet parking and they would park you within a THREE MILE RADIUS.  No thanks!  I like my vehicle nearby.
Thanks everyone there at the Hollywood for making my overnight stay so enjoyable.
To the G.M., you have an excellent front desk staff.  You are very fortunate to have co-workers who care about the place they staff and the people who they are there to care for.",,5.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-27,"Dear Guest,

With and NOT close to Hollywood!!,"When I book this hotel, The hotel website says its close to Hollywood Blvd or Hollywood, IT IS NOT, the staff are slow and not careing, our room was old and damp with old carpets, the internet was WORST and not free, 

""ultramodern Hollywood Hotel is 21st century living at its finest.""  ""luxuriant European designs and laden with cutting edge technology,"" This is false and find it misleading and wrong on the hotels part, and makes me mad as my husband got mad at me for booking this hotel. 

What a DUMP of a hotel and location. I rate it a 1 star hotel.",,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,hollywoodhotel,General Manager,2010-09-26,"Dear Brenda1970,

We are very happy that you selected the Hollywood Hotel The Hotel of Hollywood as your destination to Hollywood and we appreciate this very much as we realize that there are other options available to you. 

I am sorry that you believe the hotel is not in Hollywood or Close to Hollywood Boulevard.  If one looks at a simple map, one can see we are in Hollywood and close to Hollywood Boulevard on Vermont Avenue.  In fact,  we are the closet hotel to Griffith Park, the Griffith Observatory, The Greek Theatre and Mount Hollywood which are all straight up Vermont Avenue. 

I am sorry you had to wait for our Guest Services Cast Member to finish a call before he could check you in. Most generally our check-in procedure is smooth and quick and I agree he should have acknowledged your presence.

Most of our rooms have tile floors and some rooms have wall to wall carpets.  Your carpet was a little damp in one area because it had just been steam cleaned by our maintenance cast member before you checked in and was not completely dry.   I apologize for your an inconvenience. We like a very clean room for our guests and steam clean our carpets on a daily basis.

Our Wifi and Wired in room internet service is indeed FREE and we also provide complimentary 24/7 technical support to ensure 24/7 connectivity with your own computer.  We realize sometimes it can be challenging for guests to connect sometimes, which is why we provide complmentary professional tech support 24/7, when most hotels do not.   FREE wifi is also available in the Lobby, Bar / Lounge, Restaurant, Meeting Rooms, Banquet Rooms, Courtyard and most imporatantly .... the Pool Area.  

You might be referring to our WebTV which is provided by our Pay Per View provider Lodgenet on the guest room television.  There is a charge for WebTV.  We are currently upgrading our entire guest room television experience with 37"" LCD Television with HD signals and a new Pay Per View provider.

Our new website is in development and I'm sorry you felt our current website is misleading.

Lsolomon71,2,"Phoenix, Arizona",2010-07-31,FAMILY,2010-07-21,2,Customer Service - Sucks,"First, they were not very nice at the counter - my 2nd issue is that when I booked this, nowhere did I see that we would be charged $18.00 a day to park there, or I would not of booked there, I thought the rate was good, but after having to add that on - it really isnt.  The picutres look very nice and fanncy, its in a horrible area.   The pool was a mess, the sauna's did not work, the TV's did not work.   We had someone come in to fix our TV, and they barely spoke English, all they did was tap the removte a few times, make it turn on and left.  It turned on but the picture was awful, and it took everything in us just to change a channel.   The TV's are big tube TV's, I highly recommend they update that.  The picture rolled and was staticky.  The housekeeping comes @ 9am - everyday.  So forget  sleeping in, or anything else for that matter, they bang on your door, and then walk in 3 seconds later.  There is no do not disturb things for the door.  This hotel sucked.  And forget free internet, it's $9.95 per day.  Nothing is ""free"" at this place.",,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,hollywoodhotel,General Manager,2010-07-22,"Dear Lsolomon71,

Thank you so much for spending the time writing a review about our pet hotel. Our parking rates are listed online on our website and on all of our partners websites. I'm sorry you did not see or read about our parking rates before making your reservation. I see you are from Phoenix, Arizona where it is not common to charge for parking anywhere you go as land is abundant and relatively inexpensive, so I understand your surprise. 

In comparison with other hotels in Hollywood, our parking rates are on the low end as most hotels charge between $20-$49 per night plus tax.  Our parking fee is currently $18 plus 10% tax. Our beautifully landscaped parking lot is secure and gated and we have a 24 hour parking attendant as well. The parking fee includes unlimited in and out priviledges.

Tripadvisor reader tip.  Please expect to pay for parking everywhere you go in Los Angeles. I'm sorry but paying to parking your car is commonplace in the City of Angels and Tinseltown.

I would also like to remind our readers our room rates include a complimentary hot buffet breakfast everyy morning from 6:30am-10:30am in our dining room. Breakfast includes eggs, sausage, waffles, fruit, 4 types of cereals, milk, coffee, tea, croissants, bread, and much more. 

Our Wifi Internet is indeed complimentary and not $9.95 per day and your statement is completely false. In addition to complimentary WIFI internet access, we also offer Complimentary 24/7 Telephone Internet support with a WIFI specialist in case you need assistance connecting to our WiFi network or help configuring your computer to access our WiFi network.   

I personally checked our Sauna and it's working perfectly.  The Complimentary Suana Room is by reservation only and requires a different key than your room key to access the sauna area.  There have been a few instances where guests do not read the sign next to the Suana room door and expect their Electronic Guest Room keys to work in the Sauna Room lock. The Sauna Key is at the front desk.

We are currently changing out our 25"" ""tube"" TV's with new 37"" LCD Wall Mounted Flat Screen TV's. The installation is about 50% complete and moving forward.  When our front desk crew changed your room to a room with an LCD TV, you did not mention any of these other issues with the hotel.

We no longer have Do Not Disturb ""things"" or signs which hand on the outside of the door.  Our locks have a red light do not disturb indicator on the outside when activated by the guest from inside the guest room which notifies the Housekeeper to not disturb the guest room and come back later.   We do have a Do Not Disturb system in place and I'm sorry you did not use it.  If the Housekeeper does not see the red light do not disturb indicator, they will knock three times, wait and then knock 3 times again if there is no answer and then proceed to open the door.

Tripadvisor reader tip.  In all hotels turning the dead bolt latch on the lock from inside the guest room will prevent anyone from opening the guest room door including the housekeepers.    

Your feedback gives us the opportunity to learn and improve our policies, which we appreciate very much. We hope you will find it in your heart to allow us another chance at having you return back to our hotel. We would be delighted to have you come and see us again.

Thank you again and please do not hesitate to contact me if there is anything I can do for you in the future.

mariess,63,"San Jose, California",2010-06-30,FAMILY,2010-07-14,4,Nice hotel in convenient location.,"I stayed here for 3 nights in June, 2010 with 3 children.  We were in the area mainly for Universal Studios and Hollywood sightseeing, so we didn't spend too much time in the room.  We booked through Priceline, but beware the prices there are quoted for 1 bed and 2 people.  We had to pay extra at the hotel for a second bed.  I believe the total was around $129 a night, plus $20 per night for parking.  Still a decent value for the quality in that area.  The hotel was a couple miles from Universal Studios and Hollywood.  The area was ok.  I would not walk around there at night, as there were some groups of teens hanging out and some stores with bars on windows.  

We got a room upgrade, I guess, because we had a sofa and a sitting area with 2 chairs and table.  It was a corner room.  The room was nice.  The beds were comfortable, and they had fitted sheets on the bottom - one of my favorite hotel perks!  

The breakfast was ok.  In addition to the cold items, they had sausage, eggs (scrambled egg circles which were a spongy tasting), and waffles.  They had some good pastries.  

They have a swimming pool with no hot tub (dang).  The water was very cold.

They had free wifi in the hotel.

I would stay again and recommend.  Though if going to Universal/Hollywood again, I'd be inclined to stay further out and pay less.",,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-30,"Dear Guest,

No problems with check in, or finding our room, which was spacious and had everything we needed!  Had to pay for parking, but I think that was a good idea as the area that the hotel is located in wasn't very friendly!  Had a day of sightseeing and when I got back to the hotel I noticed that money was missing from my bag.  We made sure that our passports and money were securely locked away, but I had some english money in my hand luggage back, which was not locked away, I noticed this straight away, as I had a £20 note wrapped around two £10's and one £5, I noticed that the £5 and £10's had been seperated and the £20 was missing.  I called reception and they did genuinely seem shocked, but had to wait until morning to speak to a manager.  I went and saw somebody on reception who was quite helpful but I am not sure that anything will be done in the future to stop this.  We were suprised to find no safe in the room, and only deposit boxes on reception, which were all booked out, there were not enough boxes for rooms! As this was our second night, we did not feel comfortable staying there and requested no room service and nothing went missing after that!  If it wasn't for this incident then I would be giving this hotel a good rating, as breakfast was good and the location was near Universal Studios.  If you are staying in this hotel, beware of your items and if there are deposit boxes available get one!!",,2.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,hollywoodhotel,General Manager,2010-09-26,"Dear Pinksuzie591,

We are very happy that you selected the Hollywood Hotel - The Hotel of Hollywood as your destination to the Los Angeles / Hollywood area and we appreciate this very much as we realize  there were other options available to you. I am sorry that you had to wait to speak with a Manager regarding your missing £20 note. Most generally our hotel is very safe and secure. 
After communicating with you back and forth investigating about the missing £20 note, we concluded it was misplaced or was never in your bag in the first place.

We also increased our safe deposit box capacity and the front desk and are installing in room electronic safes into all the rooms which are large enough to accomodate a laptop computer.

Although the neighborhood surrounding the hotel was a little bit sketchy, the location itself was very convenient to Hollywood attractions.  A metro station on the red line is just one block south of the hotel, and this line takes you out to Universal Studios (and the other attractions on Hollywood Blvd.).  

We paid $18 per night to park in a gated lot.  Otherwise, we would have had to park on the street (which seemed a little risky).  The room was small but adequate, with a patio overlooking a fountain and courtyard.  The hotel had several amenities including a pool (no hot tub), sauna room, and exercise room.  A continental breakfast was provided with decent food selection.  

The elevators were extremely slow, and our room happened to be across the hall from the elevator.  We were awakened in the night by boisterous guests (hence our lowered rating on sleep quality).

dlud48,7,,2010-05-31,SOLO,2010-05-31,2,Small rooms/poor service,"I booked the HH without knowing a thing about it. It was supposed to be a 3 Star Hotel.

The room i was given (323) was the smallest room i have ever stayed in. I could touch the bed and every wall simultaneously. I didnt need the remote as I could change channels etc w/o leaving the bed. The TV itself was definitely 19"" or smaller- I think it was 15"". The inroom coffee was a 'one cupper'. There was a small micro and fridge in the room, usually a sign of a ""resident hotel"" for the locals but i considered it a plus where there were very few. 

The door to my room was maybe 4 feet from the bed and had a big gap between door and floor so for sound purposes, i might have just as well been trying to sleep in the hall. The bed itself was a double-not a queen (90% sure) and hard-very firm which worked out better than expected.

At 6AM, some rude people started talking somewhere. It sounded like they were very close but I dont know if they were in the next room, the courtyard, the room below or what. I went into the hall but  no one was  there. I wanted to shush someone and i did but it had no effect wherever they were The talkin continued on and off til i reluctantly got out of bed at 8. Earlier that day, some Hip Hop artist was on the phone in the hallway, obviously trying to be polite to his roomie, but annoying the heck out of me.

The thermostat looked brand new but had NO way to be set that i could find. When i called the front desk they couldnt help me and advised they would send a maintenance guy up when he got in after 6PM! 

The AC blew directly on my head as i attempted to sleep. I got a chair and a pen and climbed up in an attempt  to redirect the louvers away from my head. They  were painted stiff in  the present direction. No adjustment was possible. Ugh!

The breakfast was not bad but you were not allowed to bring coffee back to your room unless you paid $1/cup.

Parking was $16.50/day. Some travelers i spoke to had parked on the street to avoid the charge and relied on a wake-up call so they could move it in the morning. You guessed it. No wake up call and a big $$ ticket awaited them in the morning.

I did not enjoy my stay at all and checked out after day one though i had prepaid 4 days and it was not refundable. It was useless to me at any cost which was $79/nite +.

Im sure there are a lot of people who could have put up  with these problems but im not one of them.",,1.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,hollywoodhotel,General Manager,2010-07-18,"Dear Dlud48,

I cannot thank you enough for taking the time to share your experience at our hotel. You are one of the most talented guests I've ever heard from. I wish I could have seen your trick of touching the bed and every wall simultaneously. That deserves a Christopher Walken like Wow! Thanks for sharing.

I like to correct some of your other statements for our readers.  Our TV's are not 19 or 15 inches.  We are currently changing out our 25 inch TV's with 37"" Wall Mounted LCD TV's. At this time about 50% of the hotel is complete and more are installed every week.  

Regarding the ""onecupper"" coffee makers. Yes, our coffee makers and every hotel which abides by the Los Angeles County Health Department (LACHD) regulations should have a one cup coffee maker for sanitary reasons.  The LACHD finds in room coffee pots unsanitary for hotel rooms and enacted this new rule last year.  Coffee makers now drip into a specially designed ripple cup which are covered with a plastic cover.  Glass cups or mugs are shunned by the LACHD unless served by room service.

All of rooms have either one Queen size Bed or 2 Queen Size beds.  We have 5 rooms with King size beds.  All beds are Sealy Posturepedic Plush Beds and we have no double size beds in the hotel.

All of our guest rooms doors have rubber sound seals on each side of the door, including a rubber seal on the bottom of the door which lowers onto a marble threshold for maximum sound reduction coming from the hallways.  This is a special added feature which most hotels do not install due to the added costs. I'm sorry you still heard people talking.  Sounds like your balcony sliding door was open and someone was talking in the courtyard or another guest talking on their own balcony.

A complimentary hot buffet breakfast is included in your room rate and we do not charge extra for coffee.  Parking is $18 plus 10% tax per day, not $16.50.  I know about your friends with the parking ticket and spoke with them personally.  They set their own wake up call using our voicemail system which was set for 7:45am so they could put money in the street meter by 8am.  The system keeps an automatic log and the system called 3 times with no answer.   Apparently they came back to the hotel around 4am and were too tired and did not hear the phone ring. Sorry but you and your friends should have parked in our gated parking lot to avoid the $100 city parking citations you received.  The hotel does not reimburse for city citations.

Thank you again for your feedback.  If I can be of further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact me.

eganist,1,"Los Angeles, California",2010-05-31,COUPLES,2010-05-28,4,"Good hotel, great service","Okay, so here are the pros and cons.

Pros:
- Decent beds, even if they might be a bit small (queen for their smallest rooms)
- Quiet
- Clean
- The breakfast is good
- The comedy nights apparently are amazingly funny, though I didn't see any of them. This is going off of word from a group of Australian tourists who I encountered in the elevator
- Service was fairly good. I'll elaborate on this in a bit.

Cons:
- The building shows its age in some spots, namely with some of the rooms.
- The building's age also becomes apparent when using some of the services, such as wired internet (it's just how their system is structured. Your best bet would be to use wifi unless you need a secure connection. If you need a secure connection for things like banking, that's when you can fall back on the wired connection, even if it means moving your laptop next to your bed).

Now, with regards to service, service was promptly rendered by one of the GMs of the hotel when I noted that internet access (wired and wireless) had been flawed in our room. He promptly got back to me and tested out the wifi not just in my room but in other rooms as well, and when it became apparent that it was a systematic problem with their setup, he and his contracted staff promptly resolved the issue. Speeds are fairly decent for their internet access as well now that it works.

Anyway, getting to my point: it's a good hotel. It's better than the average 3 star hotel I've been to, which I suppose is what anyone looking for a 3 star hotel (okay, technically a 3 diamond hotel) would want. You'll likely get the best rate on hotwire for a stay here, but the rates via the Ramada's portal aren't that bad either.

Go ahead and book here. It'll be worth your while.",,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-30,"Dear Guest,

No mgr on site until Wednesday.  Heater never worked...TV remote only worked if you stood right in front of the TV and no further than one foot in front of it.  Staff was inept, not customer friendly.  Breakfast was just OK.  Ya think you folks could spring for some decent food warmers with lids instead of using tin foil to cover the food???  Overall WE WILL NEVER STAY THERE AGAIN!!!  

Orbitz was not much better and we booked through them.  On our own we booked a room at a newer hotel a few blks away and got a larger room, king size bed and amenities for a lower price!!",,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,hollywoodhotel,General Manager,2010-07-18,"Dear Tolr8me,

I cannot thank you enough for taking the time to share your experience at our hotel. First and foremost, please allow me to sincerely apologize for the incredible inconvenience we caused for you. It is never ever our intention to not provide guests the room they reserved and we dreaded doing so to you.  Fortunately, we did have another choice on that specific evening and our fast thinking desk crew upgraded your room to a Junior Suite with a queen bed which your husand graciously accepted as he was the one who registered.  Had we known you were so unsatisfied and unaccepting of this upgrade, we could have made other arrangements to satisfy you. We simply did not know how unsatisfied you were as you did not communicate with us during your entire 3 day stay.

I personally checked your room TV remote and found the batteries in the remote were low which is why it only worked closer to the TV. The signal was too weak to reach the TV from the bed.  A simple change of batteries fixed that.  Again, if you had let us know while you your remote did not work properly we would have instantly changed it out for you.

Using a heater in May in Los Angeles is very unusual since the weather is very warm. The hotel was designed with a 2 pipe central heat / Air conditioning system, which means the hotel is either on a Air Conditioning Mode or on Heat Mode. In May we are always on Air Conditioning mode.  For those very rare occasions when guests require heat instead of Airconditioning we provide a portable heater, which is in all rooms ready to use.

All of our chafing dishes or ""food warmers"" do have matching lids or covers.  When our kitchen staff bring our the replacement pans they are covered in tin foil. The tin foil is removed and the replacement pan is placed in the chafing dish with the lid.  I think you are referring to or saw a pan change.

Rest assured this has left us to evaluate our processes and we have come up with some minor adjustments and will implement them in order to avoid such matters from talking place in the future. Rest assured our entire team is focused on delivering the utmost in guest satisfaction and we will continue to do so.

Your feedback gives us the opportunity to learn and improve our policies, which we appreciate very much. We hope you will find it in your heart to forgive this incident and to allow us another chance at having you return back to our hotel. We would be delighted to have you come and see us again.

CaliSummer_10,2,,2010-04-30,FAMILY,2010-04-15,2,Has its good and bad points,"We stayed in this Hotel a week ago with our nine year old son. I will list the good and bad points and you can make your own decision.
GOOD:
Location was wonderful, we went to places like: The Grove, Universal Studios, Hollywood Walk of Fame, and La Brea Tarpits among others and never drove for more than 15 min.
The room was rather large arounf 550 sq. ft. with a wet bar, fridge and microwave. It also had a patio but it was on their public patio and hardly private.
BAD: 
We were in a room between the back (main entrance) and the lobby, the noise was next to unbearable. We asked for a new room because upon sticking my head out my door after hearing pounding on the wall, a group of drunk girls threatened to kick my [--]. I did not know them, this was at 2:30 a.m. We asked for a room change the next morning and was assured new keys would be waiting when we came in that day. We packed all our stuff loaded the car, and when we got back, no record of the request could be found, and all of a sudden they were booked. Ended up in the same room.
I have to say the young man who helped us was very nice, it wasn't his fault, and he comped us a cot for our son.

While we're thrilled you loved our location and our large rooms, we're bummed about the noise made by the group of girls while entering the hotel waking your family up.  We are a family hotel and usually have well behaving and considerate guests. I apologize for their behavior. 

I'm sorry about the room change mix up. When requesting to change rooms it's always best to complete the change in one setting, which is simply turning in the keys for your existing room and requesting keys for the new room at the same time. This way there cannot be any mixups. 

Oh, I almost forgot... I have to agree with your husband, we do not allow bugs in our rooms and take all the necessary procedures to keep them out because if we don't.... I'll freak out myself!

SamRotterdam,3,,2008-12-31,COUPLES,2010-03-28,1,Terrible Terrible Terrible!!!!!!,"The service was horrible and staff were cold and unfriendly. We had a broken hairdryer and we requested for a new one. One staff said they didn't get maintenance here and we could choose to change a room to solve the problem. He also said it was too late for that day and we needed to do that on the next day. Then we said we wold like to reserve a new room for tomorrow and he agreed. On the next day, we went to front desk and asked for a change, but another shift of staff showed up and refused our request cuz they didn't get anything from previous day. The story continued for the following days and they refused the change and never fixed the hairdryer with all kind of excuses. One funny excuses was that we had  luggage near the bed which made the room untidy and they couldn't offer this to their clients. It seemed we weren't their clients.

The room was small and doesn't look clean. The location is really in the middle of nowhere. It's in a shabby area.",,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,hollywoodhotel,General Manager,2010-05-09,"Dear SamRotterdam

Thank you for your recent feedback and I am very sorry we were unable to exceed your expectations on this stay. In that vein, the specific areas of concern you mentioned have been forwarded to the corresponding department heads for review.

I am surprised it took you almost TWO years after your stay in December  2008 to write this review and I wonder if this review is even legitimate.

Your statement that our front staff said ""we didn't get maintenance here"" is also surprising.  We have an engineering crew of five wonderful individuals who know every inch of the hotel and take great pride in keeping the hotel in tip top condition.  We keep spares for almost every part in the hotel to insure quick repairs or fixes for any possible malfunction. Replacing a hair dyer would have been a snap for any of them and luggage in the room certainly would not hinder them from replacing it either. 

I am always available for all my guests to help with anything to make your stay enjoyable.  Feel free to contact the front desk manager at extension 434 or call my extension 431 anytime while staying in the hotel. 

To conclude, we apologize for your experiences and sincerely wish to provide all our guests with a flawless experience upon their stay in Los Angeles. We hope to have such an opportunity in the near future.

The Hotel...ok well it really was a lovely hotel - clean, comfortable with HUGE rooms, we had a massive double bed each & a very large bathroom. There were also sliding doors on to a patio which was nice though we didn't use it. It was very quiet with no traffic noise. The hotel has a swimming pool too & a nice restaurant downstairs which we only used for breakfast - yummy...plenty of choice & it set us up for the day.
Location was probably the only downfall as it is a fair way from the centre of hollywood (Graumanns Chinese theatre, madame tussauds & kodak theatre etc...) & I wouldn't recommend walking to sunset boulevard either. Luckily, we were planning on hiring a car anyway - this was organised for us in the hotel as they have a company based in the lobby which was ideal. It was so easy to sort out & very reasonable. This enabled us to drive everywhere & LA is very easy to find your way around. We went to the Griffith observatory, sunset strip, venice beach, santa monica & a lovely drive around beverly hills to check out some celebrity homes, fab!
Nightlife was a LOT of fun, we met so many interesting people & the bars were gorgeous. I would definitely recommend Ketchup & Chateau Marmont (both on sunset boulevard) Also, Fred 62 (1850 vermont ave) this place is SO good for breakfast & only a short walk from the hotel.

My friend made the booking.   I was a little skeptical when I read some of the reviews.   So, here is my take:
it was previously known as the Hollywood Hotel.   It is a fairly large property on Vermont Avenue, and looks like a typical hotel out of the 60's or 70's.    But, was it rundown?   No.  It was quite obvious that considerable effort has gone into the property to renovate the facilities and there wasn't much to fault, I am plead to say.   The rates are very reasonable, which explained why the place was quite busy, and could not accomodate me for additional nights.      While I would not call the place elegant , it was much better than I expected in appearance and comfort.    Breakfast was also more than acceptable.  So, if you want to stay in this area ( I can't say, however, that I care much for the location, which isn't that bad, but is a little dodgy ) you will get good value at this Ramada.

mychina_11,1,,2010-01-31,BUSINESS,2010-01-02,2,Ridiculous pet fee,"The price for the hotel/night is awesome.  We got a steal for only $54/night.  The BIG catch is, the $35 PER night PER pet charge.  Imagine staying for 5 days with 2 small dogs and having to pay that pet fee charge.  We computed the charges, and with the rate we are required to pay for the pet fees, we might as well booked our hotel at a 4 star hotel that doesn't charge anything for pet fees.  And so after staying one night, we cancelled the rest of our reservation and booked into a ""nicer"" hotel.  This time, no pet fees.",,2.0,4.0,,4.0,2.0,4.0,hollywoodhotel,General Manager,2010-07-20,"Dear Mychina_11,

Thank you so much for spending the time writing a review about our pet fees.  Our pet policy and Pet fees are are listed online on our website and on all of our partners websites. I'm sorry you did not read the pet policies and pet fees before making your reservation.  Most pet owner's are appreciative the hotel is pet friendly as most hotels are not.  Most pet owners expect to pay a nominal pet cleaning fee which is less than placing their pet in a kennel plus they have the pleasure and benefit of having their pet accompany them during their travels.

We do charge a $35 per day fee cleaning fee plus tax for dogs and cats under 35 pounds.  Dogs over 35 pounds or other types of pet animals will require management approval before checking into the hotel and will require a $250 cleaning deposit in addition to the daily pet fee.

I would like to remind our readers our room rates include a complimentary hot buffet breakfast everyy morning from 6:30am-10:30am in our dining room.  Breakfast includes eggs, sausage, waffles, fruit, 4 types of cereals, milk, coffee, tea, croissants, bread, and much more. 

Your feedback gives us the opportunity to learn and improve our policies, which we appreciate very much. We hope you will find it in your heart  to allow us another chance at having you return back to our hotel. We would be delighted to have you come and see us again.

The bathroom was also OK, but it only had a shower, not a tub.  Parking was about 16 bucks per night and the parking area seemed fairly secure.  One problem we did have is that the front entrance only has room for one car at a time.  So if you run in to check in, you may come out to some jerk honking because you are in his way, like we did.  My biggest beef with the hotel is that is does not have room service or a place to eat after breakfast.  This surprized me as it is big enough and it does have dinning room.  We checked in late and I chose to be hungy as I didn't want to burn too many calories to find something to eat.  They say their restaurant is under renovations, but I had the free breakfast there and they didn't seem to be doing any, nor did it seem nessesary as the area was nice.  I also wanted to use the hot tub, but they don't have one and the pool is not heated.

While we're jazzed our rooms and bathrooms were OK, we're bummed that you did not get a room with a tub because most of our rooms have a tub/shower combo..

You know... there never seems to be enough room for all the cars under our porte cochere during busy check in times even though you can fit more five cars out there. We recommend to park first in our parking lot and walk in through our rear entrance to avoid any auto bottlenecks up front.

star64Colorado,11,,2009-09-30,COUPLES,2009-10-06,4,It was a good experience,"My husband and I just got back from five nights at this hotel.  I'll first say that this area is a bit questionable in some parts, but near the hotel it was fine and we had no problem.  We picked this hotel based on its location as its very close to the Kaiser Permanente Hospital on Sunset where my father in law was having surgery.  So for us it was perfect.  

The hotel is located on a busy city street.  So the driveway is small and cramped and very steep.  A friend picked us up and dropped us off which was good as another car had also pulled up and had we needed to stop there for very long, it would have been a problem.  There is a gated parking lot with an attendant that I believe is around $17 a day. We didn't need that and I am happy to say we didn't have to pay that fee.  Sadly I have stayed at hotels without a car and still had to pay some ""resort"" fee which is generally all about parking.  So I was happy about that. The lot never looked all the way full.

We were greeted by a very nice front desk employee who got us checked in very quickly.  Our requests of a top floor room near another family member were both met.  The room was on the backside of the building, it had a walkway we could have accessed via a sliding door but we never did go out there as there were no chairs and nothing really to look at.  Our room was tiny!  But for two of us it was fine and very comfortable.  We had a queen sized bed, desk, two nightstands, and a chair.  The closet was a free standing piece of furniture that also housed the t.v.  It was small but ample since our trip was short.  Inside it also had an iron and ironing board and a couple of drawers.  

The bed was very firm, bedding was fine, not worn a bit and we had four nice pillows plus another decorative pillow in a sham.  

The carpet was a bit worn but not dirty.  They had free wifi which was great for my husband and he always got a good connection with no problems.  It was unfortunate that the connection was on the nightstand.  The cord didn't really appear long enough to reach over to the desk but he didn't try too hard as the nightstand was fine if a little awkward.

The bathroom was really the weakest part of the whole stay/experience. The sink counter top was newer but the rest of the bathroom looked old.  The sink and floor were very clean, but the shower did have some mold. The shower curtain was one of those kind that slopes out which was good since it had some mold too.  The shower head was so low that even at 5'5"" I had to sort of stoop down to rinse my hair.   But the water pressure was fine, they provided plenty of towels and toiletries and other than that mold (and I have seen worse at other hotels) it was fine.  It was an older bathroom and large in size but the counter was small.  But it worked fine and the lighting was good and it had a hair dryer plus two outlets.  

The room was so quiet!  The ac is very loud and that helped but also I think it was just built well.  Across from us two of our  nights were the nosiest people.  Whenever I opened our door or came up the hallway I could hear them since their kids were always yelling, crying or running up the halls. But inside my room, I didn't ever hear them.  

I found the room carpet fine, but the hallway carpet was a bit worn and in the hallways and in the breakfast room there were lots of areas with bunched up carpet  I was really worried my aunt might trip but thankfully she didn't.  But that carpet in all common areas needs to be stretched.

I would totally stay here again.  For the area it was fine.  We had no problems with anyone scary near the hotel.  My husband and I walked down to the little Mexican place two doors down and it was fine.  I only saw one homeless person near our hotel the whole time.  The other guests were all nice (even our noisy neighbors) and it seemed a mix of tourists and some business people.  

The free breakfast was very good.  They had the same thing each morning so if you have lots of days, be prepared for that!  But they had waffles (an employee made those for you fresh), scrambled eggs (these weird patties of eggs but they tasted like little plain omlettes), three kinds of cereal, sausage,  croissants, toast, bagles with cream cheese, canned fruit, orange juice, milk, lemonade, coffee, tea and ice water.  The people that worked there were very nice and the eating area was very large and clean.  They had staff to bus the tables and they kept it clean even on the busy days.  

I know some people have had some issues with this place, we didn't.  We got a very good rate, the staff were all nice, it felt secure, the area was not bad, and our room was comfortable and clean.  The maids did a very good job each day on our room.  I would totally stay here again and recommend it to anyone who needed that area.    And believe me, compared to the Travel Lodge down the street, this place is much better!  I saw it from the outside, it looked sort of nasty and my father in law had toured it before our visit (since it and the Ramada were the closest) and they wouldn't even let him see a room.  He felt much better about us staying here and he was right.",,5.0,5.0,,3.0,4.0,4.0,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-30,"Dear Guest,

imdisgusted2l,1,,2009-09-30,FAMILY,2009-09-28,1,worse hotel,"We stayed one night, prebooked thru our travel service.  Since it is a 3 diamonds  hotel, we expected at the very least better than average.  We were at Universal studios all day,  checked in later in the evening.  My daughter was having problems with asthma, so we were anxious to settle her in.  The lobby at first glimpse was very nice.  On the way up to our room we realized that the hotel was less than clean.  Huge stains on the ceiling and hall carpeting.  On entering the room, we very disappointed at how shabby and worn it was.  The carpet was soiled, and rippling.  The furnishings ""well used"".  The bed coverings were lumpy, bedding thin and well used. At first we thought the beds hadn't been changed.  After checking to make sure the beds were fresh, my daughter was going to shower and go to bed.  First thing, walking thru the bathroom door we saw a big chunk out of the bathroom countertop.  We tried to call the lobby about this and the fact that there was no soap, shampoo etc.    After 3 efforts we did get a desk clerk.  None of the personel  was aware of the damaged countertop or seemed to even care. We didn't have small children with us.  If we had that broken edge would have been a hazard.  It doesnt end there tho.   At any other time, we would have asked for another room, but our daughter was quite ill.  After she was in bed, I went into take my shower (with soap I brought) and discovered ants all over the floor.   Second floor room, how do you get ants?  I looked around.  The door jamb is metal it was rusting at the base and top, paint long gone.  This is where they were  coming from.  As I stood back up, I realized that  the lowered section of ceiling on the shower entry was separating and molded.  The shower ceiling was also molded.  Too late to go elsewhere, we stayed.  The neighborhood was not one I would chose if I knew the area.  We are not familiar with L.A. or Hollywood.  Its not an area I would wander around in and sightsee if there was anything to see.  We did go down for the continental breakfast.  Usual fare, cold cereal, canned fruit, toast  and juice.  They have 5 toasters 2 l/2 of the toasters worked.  Afterwards, my daughter made a powder stop at the guest bathroom in the LOBBY.  It was disgusting.  One toilet was broken and ""filled"".  One sink was broken, there was dirty papertowels, q tips all over the floor and sink top. This bathroom can't be more than 20' feet from the registration desk.  I plan to complain about all of this to my travel service and I am backing it up with pictures.  I am also going to ask if they feel I should call the L.A. Health Dept.  that mold situation is not something you want to  spend time sleeping or relaxing near.",,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,hollywoodhotel,General Manager,2010-07-19,"Dear Imdisgusted2,

I cannot thank you enough for taking the time to share your experience at our hotel. First and foremost, please allow me to sincerely apologize for the incredible inconvenience we caused you. 

I would like to notify all our readers that all of our hallway carpets and all the guest rooms with carpet were replaced with new carpets shortly after this review was written.  Most of our guest rooms are tile and have area rugs instead of wall to wall carpeting.  All of our armoire furniture were replaced with new credenzas and desks to accommodate our new 37""  LCD TV's.  Our beds are also new Sealy Posturepedic Plush Beds and we regularly buy new linens and duvets. 

You did call the LA County Health Department and a health inspector did inspect your room shortly after you checked out and I'm pleased to say no mold or mildew was found nor ants or any other kind of pests as you have stated.  Ants do come and go especially if food or candy is left laying around, which sometimes happens.  We do fumigate the hotel perimeter on a regular basis to reduce any pests from becoming unwanted guests. 

Rest assured this has left us to evaluate our processes and we have come up with some minor adjustments and will implement them in order to avoid such matters from talking place in the future. Rest assured our entire team is focused on delivering the utmost in guest satisfaction and we will continue to do so.

Your feedback gives us the opportunity to learn and improve our policies, which we appreciate very much. We hope you will find it in your heart to forgive this incident and to allow us another chance at having you return back to our hotel. We would be delighted to have you come and see us again.

Thank you again and please do not hesitate to contact me if there is anything I can do for you in the future.

DCObserer,1,,2008-11-30,FAMILY,2009-09-20,1,I want to warn you!,"I want to warn you about this hotel:  Stay Away!   I am not disparaging the Ramada chain -- I've stayed at Ramadas around the world, and they are generally more than adequate.  But this Ramada is in a class by itself -- it's HORRIBLE.  In fact, the defects of this hotel are so deeply-ingrained and pervasive that I don't think anything can be done to fix it, apart from firing the entire staff and getting new ownership and managers.  Clear the decks!!  First of all, this Ramada is on the eastern OUTSKIRTS of Hollywood -- VERY inconvenient if you want to be in the midst of the Hollwyood action.  It's on the edge of Hollywood in a DANGEROUS, extremely sketchy neighborhood and you're literally taking your life into your hands if you walk around these streets at night.  Secondly, the front desk staff is the pits.  I have never in my life seen a hotel front desk staff so apathetic and resentful of their jobs.  They did not even treat me like a human being.  They all seem to have huge chips on their shoulders about one thing or another.  They are the epitome of people in dead-end jobs who know it and hate it, AND who intend to take that out on any convenient target -- meaning YOU.   Absolutely rotten, pathetic attitudes, to a person.  There was not one person that I dealt with -- and I dealt with a lot of them -- not ONE of these people was in the least bit friendly.  On the first day, I had to make a trip back to LAX to pick up my cousin who was arriving from Italy.  I asked for a taxi to LAX.  They got me not a taxi, but a LIMO.  I asked how much.  They told me it would be $55 one way -- which was $15 more than it cost me to arrive att the hotel from LAX, by regular taxi, a few hours earlier.  I told them that I DID NOT ASK FOR A LIMO.  I ASKED FOR A TAXI.  The ENTIRE front desk staff consisting of three people were nasty and dismissive of me, all of them insisting that because the limo had already arrived, I had to use it!  Also, the Limo driver came into the reception area and insisted I ride his limo, even though it was $15 more than the taxi.  The front desk staff told me that the hotel has a deal with that Limo service, and that since the limo had already come, I had to take it, I had no choice, I had already ""committed"" to using the limo.  I told them that I hadn't asked for a limo.  NOT ONE OF THEM would admit their mistake or attempt to remedy it.  All of them -- the 3 front desk people and the limo driver made me feel guitly, pressured me into taking the limo, telling me I ""had"" to.   

AND FROM THERE, THINGS WENT DOWNHILL ALL THE WAY.... More to come...",,,,,,,,BALLYHOOEY,Manager,2009-10-01,"Thank you for your recent feedback and I am very sorry we were unable to exceed your expectations on this stay.  In that vein, the specific areas of concern you mentioned have been forwarded to the corresponding department heads for review.

While it seems you have many unusual issues, I am surprised it took you almost a year after your stay in November 2008 to write this review.

Your statement the front desk staff called a ""LIMO"" for you is Ballyhooey. I am sorry to disappoint all Tripadvisor readers that there isn't  a limosine company in LA which would charge $55 to go to the airport.  Everyone would request a ""LIMO"" if they knew it only cost $55! Limosines typically cost $150-$350 and hour with a four hour minimum plus driver tip.  Rates go past $1K+ an hour during special events such as the Oscars or Grammys.  The driver's tip alone would be more than the $55 you stated.

A regular taxi cost $50-$65 depending on the route to or from LAX, so the $55 you stated was not out of line.

Your comment stating ""I had to take it, I had no choice, I had already ""committed"" to using the limo"" is also bizarre.  The power to just say NO and refuse service is and always was yours.  There was no ""commitment"" on your part as we do not take deposits or credit card guarantee for calling a taxi or a ""Limo""

The hotel does have a car rental desk which offers autos for rent from as low as $29.99 per day.  For more information click on the car rental button on our website for more information.  Renting a car would have been the less expensive solution for you, since you were doing a round trip to the airport.

Another solution is to take the metro subway from the Airport to the Hotel which would cost about $2.50 per person each way.  For metro schedules please visit metro.net

RonniLynn,46,"East Brunswick, New Jersey",2009-08-31,FAMILY,2009-09-07,5,Great hotel but not near attractions,"Before booking the hotel, I read many reviews, which indicated that the hotel is within walking distance to attractions such as Graumann's Chinese Theatre and Walk of Fame. This is NOT the case. It is a 15 minute drive and then, on average, a $10 parking fee. That said, the hotel was clean, the bed was very comfortable, the room was quiet, breakfast was free and delicious, and within walking distance to a nice Italian restuarant and Wendy's. I hated the one-time $16 parking fee at the hotel. I'd rather they charge more for the room.",,4.0,5.0,,4.0,5.0,5.0,BALLYHOOEY,General Manager,2009-09-25,"Thank you kindly for taking the time to share your complimentary remarks! It is our priority to exceed our guests' expectations, and we are pleased to hear that we met and exceeded yours. 

I'm sorry you felt ""the hotel is within walking distance to attractions such as Graumann's Chinese Theatre and Walk of Fame.""  One solution is to walk across the street to the Metro Subway Station and take the redline for only three stops to the Hollywood/Vine to see the walk of Fame or the Hollywood/Highland Station to see Gramans Chinese Theatre.  If you drive and want to park inexpensively, park at the Hollywood / Highland complex and validate your parking ticket in any store which reduces the parking fee to $2.00 for 4 hours instead of $10.

If we charged more for the room to include the parking fee, it would cost ALL guests more, even those without an auto which wouldn't be fair.  Also the taxes would be more, since occupancy tax is 14% and parking tax is only 10%.   Total charges are less if the room and parking fees are separated which is why all hotels in LA charge separatelt.  We looking out for your best interests.

shenel84,4,,2009-08-31,FRIENDS,2009-09-03,3,The truth about Ramada and Hollywood,"Went to Hollywood with 2 friends as it was somewhere I had always wanted to go since I was a teen. I built Hollywood up so much and It truly was as crazy and as fun as i imagined. 
firstly, we didnt want to spend loadsa money on flight and accomadation, we found a good package on Expedia: Ramada Inn on Vermont with Air New Zealand. Air New Zealand was great. Ramada was also good, however there were a few issues, but nothing major. 
1) the Location is fine if you hire a car, I couldn't as i am only 24 and you have to be 25. So we spent a lot in cab fares, which was annoying.  Ramada is close to universal studios, which is great. It is also about a 10-15 minute drive to both Hollywood Boulevard and Sunset Strip in west Hollywood. If however, you are able to spend more money on your hotel, than you cant beat the renaissance hotel. It looked amazing. 

Anyway, back to the Ramada. The Hotel staff in general were quite moody people, but they were helpful enough. We found that we were always greeting them rather than the other way round, but who gives a crap, they did their jobs and thats all that matters- although a smile couldn't hurt hey. 

The pool was great, the gift shop keeper was very helpful and sweet. 

We didn't have enough time to check out the gym and sauna, but they were there....

The Bar was never open- it looked small and boring anyway. 

the Breakfast was repetitive, but it was good enough, you got the usual cereal, toast, fruit, tea and coffee and then the sausage, eggs and waffles, it was nice actually. 

the rooms where a bit small but 3 girls with loadsa luggage managed it. There wasnt enough storage, that was the main issue. The beds were very comfortable. Oh and the maid service was great, the room was immaculate, really impressive service. 

Overall, our stay at Ramada was good enough considering what we paid. It would of been nice if it was a touch closer to the Hollywood Blvd mainly. West Hollywood is a bit pretentious, but I still wouldn't say no. 

Oh yes sorry I forgot, the street that Ramada is on is a bit vile, quite a few hobos around, but in the day it was fine, we walked to the supermarket and the subway and it was fine. It is a bit seedy but we are from London so we are used to these sorts of areas I guess. 

Its surprising how many homeless people there are in LA overall actually. 

Ok so, the subway and buses are easily accessible. The staff were quite helpful with where to go, which buses to take etc.......

Go to Santa Monica for the day its beautiful-or stay there if you can. 
Venice beach is crazy too, there is some man that sings, ""jingle bells jingle bells help me get drunk"" hahaha, so give him a few dollars if you see him!! : ) 

Loads of nice restaurants- Katsuya is great! Les Deux bar and nightclub is great! 
Saw a few celebs about like Fat joe, Kim Kardasian....

oh and go to Madame Tussauds, that was fun too.

Ramada offer all the excursions with travel included so that was good too. 

I think thats pretty much it, the best thing I can say about Hollywood is that you have to see it for yourself to make a judgment, no one can tell you what to expect I guess. But Overall I loved it and the Ramada wasnt that bad compared to some reviews. I'm going to Santa Monica in Easter time, can't wait...yippeeeeee.",,4.0,3.0,,2.0,4.0,5.0,BALLYHOOEY,Manager,2009-09-29,"Thank you so much for taking the time to share your complimentary remarks!

I'm sorry you spent so much in cab fares and thought you could not rent a car because you were under 25 years of age.  While all major brand car rental agencies do not rent cars to persons under 25 years of age, our car rental desk located in the hotel lobby specializes in renting to persons under 25 years of age.

AusssieTraveller,11,"Melbourne, Australia",2009-06-30,FRIENDS,2009-08-20,4,"Excellent value, convenient area. Definitely recommended.","After months of reading reviews and looking at maps, a friend and I finally decided to book here. We stayed a week so we were crossing our fingers that it was decent enough to see us through. We were definitely satisfied with our choice. Many of the reviews on here are unrealistic - to people wanting 5 star accommodation, BOOK A 5 STAR HOTEL!

We had a fantastic room singled off from the others with a generous sized living room, TV area, separate bathroom and plenty of space. We had 6 bags and they were able to be stored without interfering with our living space.

The included breakfast made a huge difference in our budget. It's the same every morning but it's GREAT VALUE. The beds were large and comfortable and the room was EXTREMELY CLEAN and made over every day before we returned. The fridge and microwave in the room saved our lives. For those on a budget or those who just appreciate having somewhere to store a cold drink and sandwich, then this will make your stay fantastic. We spent $25 on food the entire week because we could store it. It was also nice to not have to go out for every meal, especially at the end of a long day. The staff were pleasant enough and helpful when asked. The pool area is great, towels were provided and it was relatively quiet.

Being young and our first solo trip, all of these things made a huge difference, granted we were out every single day we were there. For the younger crowd and those wanting to travel on a budget, I could not recommend this place enough. It is literally a block from the train station - which we used every day. A walk in the other direction took us to Los Feliz Village - an up and coming trendy area with several cafes, vintage stores and things to look at. This hotel is also a pickup and drop off destination for Star Line tours if you're looking at doing anything around the area. 

Excellent value for money. I would stay here again as opposed to paying double for a better zip code. I've also stayed at the Ramada Plaza and think it's way overpriced and further out of the way as far as public transport is concerned. A great middle of the road hotel so please disregard the reviews that nit pick every detail. Some people want everything for nothing. You don't stay here for luxury, you stay for value and comfort. I was pleasantly surprised.

As a side note, the area is also not too bad. We went out a few times and caught the train back late at night. It was frequented with security and police and even walking back to the hotel was fine. If you use your street smarts then you will be fine, as you should wherever you are.

Hope this helped.",,5.0,3.0,,4.0,4.0,4.0,BALLYHOOEY,General Manager,2009-09-26,"WooHoo!

We found the hotel comfortable and clean and the free breakfast was a bonus (not fantastic quality but a good range of items, and I don't get the impression that U.S. hotels in this price range really excel at breakfast generally.  This was certainly the best we ate where any was provided).  Pool was nice.  We got a good, large, quiet  room so I'm unclear as to why a previous review said they reserve rubbish rooms for Expedia customers, as this clearly wasn't the case for us.  I also didn't think the area was rough - it felt a bit deserted at night but not dangerous.  And there are some great places to eat up towards Los Feliz if you're prepared to walk or drive about 10 blocks north.  Only downside was secure parking was an extra $16.50 per night, which we weren't aware of and which pushed the price of the stay up somewhat.",,4.0,4.0,,3.0,4.0,4.0,BALLYHOOEY,General Manager,2009-09-26,"WooHoo!

The hotel is not in the best part of hollywood but we were close to hollywood sign, the walk of fame, paramount studios, and universal studios.  We went to a super restaurant called Dresdens - the write-up given by the hotel was awful but the restaurant was brilliant.  

Our room was clean, the air conditioning worked and Wi Fi was free as was tea and coffee.  The breakfast was adequate - was do you expect for free?

The ""view"" from the room was dreadful - but who cares, we were out all day and most of the evening.

The worst bit of this hotel is the appaling reception staff - they are totally uninterested in you and of no help whatsoever.

If you are looking for a reasonably priced hotel, for a few nights close to many of the tourists spots then use this hotel - its not grand but we paid a low price and it was perfect for our needs.  You get what you pay for!!

Your statement that our front staff said "" that these were the rooms for hotels.com, expedia.com etc. guests."" is also surprising. Expedia and hotels.com are two of our best travel agents and we would never say anything to discredit these two important companies.  We do not rate our rooms poor, good, best and assign rooms only based on roomtype.  Every guest, no matter how they booked, has the option to preview several available rooms at check in and in different hotel locations and choose the one that suits them best. 

We have an engineering crew of five wonderful individuals who know every inch of the hotel and take great pride in keeping the hotel in tip top condition. We keep spares for almost every part in the hotel to insure quick repairs or fixes for any possible malfunction.

The hotel provides a complimenatary hot buffet breakfast every morning from 6:30am-10:30am.  Our food an supplies is supplied by the one of the best food suppliers in the country, Sysco.  Sysco probably serves 75% of the restaurants and hotels nationwide, which means they provide the best quality food.

I am always available for all my guests to help with anything to make your stay enjoyable. Feel free to contact the front desk manager at extension 434 or call my extension 431 anytime while staying in the hotel.

We hauled our luggage to the elevator, which was extremely slow. When we got to our room, the windows were open, the maintenance man was working on the air conditioner and the maid was cleaning the room. They told us to come back later. I asked the maintenance man if the air was broken and he replied no that is was just fine. We hung out in the parking lot until they were done with our room. 

During our stay, the air did not work. I asked for a different room, but I was told they were completely booked. They sent the maintenance man up who said he thought the room was fine but that he would tell his boss it felt hot. We never heard anything from anyone. None of us could sleep. We opened the windows, but it was still miserable. At checkout the next day, I told them how horrible our stay was, but they ignored me and never offered an apology. I told them I shouldn't have to pay for the room or parking - but they didn't comp anything. They charged us full price. The area of town did not seem too safe either.

We appreciate the attention to detail you provided, as it gives us ample opportunity to review potential challenges and address them without delay. In that vein, the specific areas of concern you mentioned have been forwarded to the corresponding department heads for review. 

While it seems you had many issues with the hotel from the moment you arrived,I will try to address them. 

1- I am sorry you feel the lady behind the front desk was pretty rude for giving you ""short answers"" to your questions.  Our intentions are to satisfy our guests with answers which satisfy all questions, Some answers could be short and some long depending on the type of question, nevertheless if you feel the answer was insufficient, next time please make your feelings known and any of our desk clerks would be more than happy to elaborate further on the subject.  You may also direct your questions to the front office manager.

2- The hotel does have five self service luggage carts for guest use.  There is really no need to ""haul"" luggage anywhere in the hotel. 

3-We had extremely hot weather in July and our airconditioners were working overtime to compensate for it.  We find many times, that guests are sometimes impatient with the airconditioning system and think by opening the windows the room we cool down faster, which is not the case.  When a window is opened, the aircondiioner in the room shuts off in order to conserve energy as the room will not cool down with an open window anyway.  The best solution is to keep all windows closed and let the A/C do its thing.

Eventhough the hotel is fully booked during the summer season, changing rooms would not have resulted in a cooler room as the hotel is on a central A/C system.  The A/C is the same no matter which room you are in.  Again the solution is to keep the windows closed.

To conclude, we apologize for your experiences and sincerely wish to provide you with a flawless experience upon your return to Los Angeles. We hope to have such an opportunity in the near future.",3

JHS08,1,,2009-06-30,BUSINESS,2009-06-28,1,Rude Counter Service and Deceptive Priceing,"I booked this 3-day stay on the phone (local number).  At that time I explained that I was paying for two days and I would have a voucher from Kaiser for one day.  The reservation person said that would be no problem and I was given a room rate for the stay.   When I checked in, I reminded the person at the front desk that I would bring the voucher in as soon as I got it from Kaiser.   I received the voucher from Kaiser on the second day and brought it to the front desk.  I was told that since I was paying for one day with a voucher, I would have to pay a much higher room rate.  When I complained, the reservation manager was summoned.  He told me that it didn't matter what I told him, he was going to tell me the way it was going to be.  Meanwhile the counter personnel were snickering and rolling their eyes.   I left the counter feeling like I had been taken advantage of and ridiculed at the same time.

Thank you for your recent feedback and I am very sorry we were unable to exceed your expectations on this stay. In that vein, the specific areas of concern you mentioned have been forwarded to the corresponding department heads for review.

A room certificate voucher is a voucher for a complimentary stay.  There is no room rate attached to it, so there was ""no higher rate"" as you stated.  There are terms and conditions stated on the back of ther certificate.  One of the terms and conditions is one cannot use the certificate in conjunction with other hotel promotions or discounts.  Since you did not have the voucher in your hands at the time you made your reservation, you could read the terms and conditions of the certificate and the reservationist could not determine what kind of voucher you had.

You made a reservation with a prepay, stay 3 nights, get X% off promo.  The room certificate could not be used in conjuction with this promo for one of the nights.  Sorry, but our front desk crew and reservation manager were only following the terms and conditions of the voucher.  There was nothing deceptive about it as the terms and conditions were stated on the certificate.  I cannot see how you were taken advantage of when you received a complimentary room night from Kaiser.  Most people would be happy they received a comp night and a complimentary hot buffet all you can eat breakfast for all 3 days too boot!

I am always available for all my guests to help with anything to make your stay enjoyable. Feel free to contact the front desk manager at extension 434 or call my extension 431 anytime while staying in the hotel. 

To conclude, we apologize for your experiences and sincerely wish to provide all our guests with a flawless experience upon their stay in Los Angeles. We hope to have such an opportunity in the near future.

jenappletree,31,,2009-04-30,COUPLES,2009-05-09,4,More than adequate!,"I too am a reviewer who is puzzled at the bad reviews that this place has received. The hotel was more than just 'adequate' for us and unless they have done major renovations and fix ups just before we arrived, I would say the others are just super picky?

The location is great for catching a Red Line subway, which, when you're in LA you probably would want to do to visit Hollywood Walk of Fame etc. Don't bother walking if you have to go more than a few blocks as the walks are very boring and shady characters are always seemingly lurking. It's not like Manhattan where you walk 20 blocks and don't even realise because there are things to see on the way.

Anyway, the whole hotel and room was very clean and well appointed with TV, fridge and microwave included. Everything was fully operational in our room. There is a guest laundry on the premises. We did not need to use the parking. Despite what the other reviewers have written, we found the staff to be very helpful and friendly. The room space was comfortable. Breakfast was excellent, the service was excellent and they even make you waffles to order. The breakfast room was also nicely decorated for Easter at the time. Out of all the places I have been this one had the best breakfast ever. I would not hesitate to stay here again.",,5.0,5.0,,4.0,5.0,5.0,BALLYHOOEY,Owner,2009-06-06,"Thank you kindly for taking the time to share such complimentary remarks!

My main interests were in Hollywood Boulevard area and on 2 days I did not need to use any car: the excellent Red Line subway took me to Hollywood/Vine or Hollywood/Highland. 5 minute walk from the hotel to the station. 10 minute ride to Hollywood/Highland. There was no need to take any car to Universal Studios either:
the next stop after Hollywood/Highland is Universal Studios.

I am used to finding US hotels having no complimentary breakfast. And if they have one it is a joke. Here at Ramada Inn the complimentary breakfast at 06.30 - 10.00. was decent. A very big plus in my books.",,4.0,3.0,,5.0,3.0,3.0,BALLYHOOEY,Owner,2009-06-06,"Thank you for such a complimentary response.

The place is great! let us check in early, professional staff, gym, laundry room, steam room, pool. Rooms are decent size, nicely furnished, huge shower cubicle and balcony that you can see the Hollywood Sign from. Only downside is the location, its near nothing except for the wrong end of Hollywood BLVD.

ReviewAddict20,2,,2009-03-31,FAMILY,2009-04-08,3,"Nice hotel, Area Questionable!","We stayed at the Ramada for 1 night at the end of March 09, I paid aprox £55 per room so didn't expect to much! 
We were pleasantly surprised when entering the reception looked like a very nice hotel.

The rooms were small compared to a standard room in the USA but fine for a brit! The rooms had a balcony over looking a lovely courtyard also had a fridge and a microwave. Everything was clean. Plenty towels. 

The hotel itself had good faculties - 

3 Sauna's although only one was working, a steam room 
Nice pool
Small gift shop 
Laundry room 
Free internet in the rooms 
Pay internet on PC in reception 

Breakfast was buffet style and included in the room price, waffles made to order we great the rest was basic, few choices of cereal bread for toast & bagels. My husband had sausage and eggs but they did not look too good! 

The hotel advertises itself as near Universal, we did not have a car so I don’t know exactly how far universal was by road. We had already been to universal while staying at an other hotel the previous week but with my basic knowledge of the public transport system it was not that close! 

The hotel is situated in a rougher neighborhood on our 3min walk from the metro station to the hotel we saw people spraying graffiti, the shops (mostly beauty salons and liquor stores) are well protected by metal bars this does not instill confidence. Later that afternoon other members of our party saw a girl being pushed against a wall with a guys hand up her top she was struggling and saying I didn't do anything! They felt intimidated when I asked what they did, they said ""we didn't get shot"" ""we just kept walking"" If we had children or even if we were all females I would not have been happy staying in that area and probably would not stay there again.",,,,,,,,BALLYHOOEY,General Manager,2009-06-11,"Thank you for your recent feedback.

We appreciate the attention to detail you provided, as it gives us ample opportunity to review potential challenges and address them without delay. In that vein, the specific areas of concern you mentioned have been forwarded to the corresponding department heads for review. Regarding your  question how close we are to Universal Studios.... I have driven to Universal Studios in as little as 4 minutes and as much as 16 minutes. It all depends on traffic.  The best ways to Universal  Studios is to take the Red Line Metro Subway which takes 12 minutes and  the metro station is across the street from the hotel at the corner of Santa Monica and Vermont.... or to take the Guideline Tours shuttle from our lobby which departs every morning from the hotel lobby.  Please note ...Universal Studios entrance tickets must be purchased from the shuttle driver at regular entrance prices.  For more info on Guideline Tours, please visit www.guidelinetour.s.com. About the neighborhood ... there is one convenience store and beauty salon  in the strip mall across the street and another salon to the south of the hotel, and have used them both to cut my own hair!  I have been in this neighborhood for 15 years and have never seen ""people spraying graffiti"" or ""anyone being pushed up against a wall"".

mostmprest,2,,2009-03-31,FAMILY,2009-03-13,1,"Run Away, Do Not Look Back!","I booked this hotel for 5 nights as a get-away for my daughter's spring break.  I should have left after the 1st night, but I thought things would surely improve.  Like it was a fluke that things were so wrong right from the start....  First of all, there's a ramp to drive up when you check in.  Only 2 cars can fit there, at best.  When we arrived, the whole space was taken up by a SUV that was parked right in the middle leaving no space for my little car.  The rug between the beds was filthy!  There was mold on the tile/grout in the shower, which had NO hot water, even after maintenance ""fixed"" it.  Our room was not even cleaned the 1st day...the towels were taken but not replaced.  We never got additional bottles of conditioner after the 1st one was used.  There were stains on the seat of the one and only chair.  There was no place to unpack, and only 4 hangers to use.  The electrical outlets didn't work, unless plugged into the ones on the lamps.  No mirrors except in the bathroom/on the bathroom door.  The shower curtain rod was broken so the curtain didn't stay closed.  The floor in the bathroom never did get cleaned the entire time.  The access to the internet went off after 5 minutes but we were charged the 10 bucks anyway.  The remote for the TV was a joke.  The lighting was horrible.  Two lamps, and dim lights above the beds were not enough to read by.  The walls were all scuffed up, apparently by luggage being thrown against them.  The only positive was the beds.  Very comfortable and awesome sheets.  The continental breakfast was adequate at best.  Good waffles, but how can they call those round things ""eggs""?  Gag!  I will NEVER EVER stay here again, and I will think twice befor booking at any Ramada (who supposedly have a good reputation).",,2.0,2.0,,3.0,1.0,1.0,BALLYHOOEY,General Manager,2009-06-11,"Thank you for your recent feedback and I am very sorry we were unable to exceed your expectations on this stay.

In that vein, the specific areas of concern you mentioned have been forwarded to the corresponding department heads for review. 

While it seems you had many issues with the hotel from the moment you arrived,I will try to address a few of them. 

1-The driveway is the approximately 8 car lengths long and is best used for drop off or pick up.  There is a 10 minute wait period in the driveway.  To check in it is probably best to park in our parking lot first then enter the hotel and walk to the lobby to check in. 

2-Cleanliness or plumbing problems in a guest room are unexceptable and I wish I had the opportunity to correct them while you were checked in. I wish you had brought them to my attention during the 5 days of your stay.

3-Our housekeepers clean and replace all bathroom amenities on a daily basis. Now... if a guest places a do not disturb sign on the outside of the room door, the room will not be cleaned for the day.  Our housekeeprs go home at 4:30pm, however towels and all bathroom amenties including shampoo, conditioner, lotion, mouthwash, toothpaste, tooth brushes, combs, shavers, shaving cream, and deoderant are always available at the front desk 24 hours a day.  Please place the do not disturb sign outside your door only if you are actually in the room.  Many times guests accidentally leave the room and leave the DND sign hanging outside only to come return ... usually late... to an unmade room. Also,  please do not use the DND sign as a security device to prevent hotel staff from entering the room... its not intended for that.

4-There are at least 1 lounge chair or Sofa and 1 desk chair in each room per Ramada and AAA standards.  The upholstery is routinely steam cleaned by our own maintenance staff.

5-There are at least 8 hangers in each room per Ramada and AAA standards.  If you need more we will gladly have more hangers delivered to your room.... just ask the front desk.

6-If the electrical outlets did not work, then the lamps and outlets on the lamps would not have work either. Each room has plenty of outlets as well as on the table lamps for phone and pda  chargers.

7- There is a mirror in the bathroom above the sink, a full length mirror on the bathroom door and mirror picture frame above the desk or dresser.  I'm sorry but we do not have mirrors on the ceiling above the bed.

8-The hotel provides FREE high speed wireless and wired internet access with 24/7 telephone technical support in all rooms provided you have your own computer with wireless ethernet connectivity.  The hotel also hasWEBtv by lodgenet for a fee for those guests who did not bring their own computer. There is also an internet kiosk and printer in the lobby for a fee.

9-There are 2 table lamps or two wall lamps next to the bed(s) which can be used for reading.  Some rooms have dimmable mood light fixtures in the ceiling which are not intended to be used for reading.

10-Thank you for complimenting our Sealy Posturepedic beds and 250 thread count sheets.

The only bad thing was the elevators are slow and they do not allow you to use the stairs unless it is an emergency. I asked the front desk why and they said they have a problem with homeless people sleeping in the stairways... Seems like they could put a card reader on the doors. The free breakfast wasnt excactly gourmet, but are you looking for good food or a good value?  Parking was 15 or 18 a night.. can't remember excactly, and as I soon learned in this town, that is reasonable!..

I don't stay in hotels very often and for my price-range I have reasonably low expectations I think.  I have definitely stayed in cheaper hotels that were nicer, however.  A quick list of my biggest gripes:
- had to duck to get under the showerhead - I'm 5'5""; showerhead was slightly calcified, moldy
- shower curtain rod was falling out of the wall
- twice (of five nights) the bathroom was slightly dirtier after cleaning than it was before
- one (1) elevator to access floors 2, 3, and basement (where breakfast was) - and there were no stairs (except emergency stairs), had multiple discussions with other hotel guests about the slowness and disappointment of this one elevator to access our rooms
- shared courtyard balcony with one other hotel room
- electrical plugs quickly fell out of the old wall sockets
- power outage one night for the single outlet that connected desk lamp, microwave, fridge, coffee maker
- no in-room safe in my room
- 1Queen room only includes coffee for one person; coffee maker was also single-serving
- free wifi didn't always work, once with an error message that I couldn't use hotmail on their network
- breakfast left something to be desired; lots of starches; few other options; watery coffee and juice
- location was not worth the price (although I'm not a driver; maybe it would've seemed closer to things by car)",,2.0,1.0,,3.0,1.0,2.0,hollywoodhotel,General Manager,2010-07-21,"Dear Rausch56,

If you were so unsatisfied with your room why did you not ask to be moved to another room or call me or one of my assistants. We also have 3 elevators not one and 4 staircases in each corner of the building for guest use.

We have a wide variety of options for our breakfast buffet and we must cater to all guests tastes. Some guests like starchy foods so we provide, some like the healthy foods and we provide them too.  If there is an item(s) you think we should add, we are open to suggestions and will most likely provide them too.

LJPGeoman,75,"Sacramento, California",2009-01-31,COUPLES,2009-01-30,4,No Worries!,"After we booked this hotel for six nights, I read the mostly negative reviews and almost cancelled our reservation.  We decided to give it a try anyway figuring if it was so bad, we could cancel the remainder and find another hotel.  I'm glad we did as we were pleasantly surprised!  I will address all the negative comments I read as compared to our experience.
     We wanted a hotel centrally located between Culver City and Burbank (for movie studio tours) and this hotel met that need.  Yes it is not in the nicest area but we didn't think the area was terrible or dangerous.  If you like to walk to places from your hotel or walk to restaurants nearby, then you will probably not like this location.  However, It is only a few minutes drive from many of the major Hollywood sites and restaurants.
    Check-in was easy and the staff was friendly and helpful.  I forgot to ask for my Wyndam Rewards credit while there.  I called the manager after returning home and he gave me the full credit.
    They now charge $16.50 a day for parking in a secured lot in the back.  There were plenty of spaces available at all times.  If you do not want to pay for parking, you may be able to find a spot on one of the side streets nearby.
     We used two different elevators and they were NOT slow for us.
     The room was large and clean and had a large flat screen TV, microwave oven, refrigerator and everything worked fine.  The bed was very comfortable.
     The free buffet breakfast was better than most at similar priced hotels.  Yes they had the same items everyday but they had enough variety that you could have something different each day: cereal, scrambled eggs, sausage, waffles made to order for you, toast, fruit, milk, juice and pastries.
     USA Today newspapers are provided free each day.
     Our in room wi-fi connection for our laptop computer worked fine and was NOT slow.
     We did hear the band play on Friday night but it did not keep us awake.
     They had a free comic show in the bar on Monday night but the comics were not funny so we left early.
     The pool looked very nice but it was too cold outside to swim.
     This hotel is rated three diamonds by AAA and I would agree with that rating.  If we ever go back to Hollywod, I would definately stay at this Ramada Inn again.",,4.0,4.0,,3.0,4.0,4.0,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-30,"Dear Guest,

Near Metro station, so for those in a really tight budget (or who wants to spend the most in fun lol) is a great help. Also close by is one of the Observatory shuttle stops (weekends only) so dont forget to pay a visit there!. 

The Continental breakfast was great, but is the only meal possible!. No restaurant service for the rest of the day, altought the room had appliances so in case of a quick meal, just a visit to the nearest restaurant or Kmart to m-oven later.

My only real complaint: the ""free"" internet service was awful, almost never worked. Just a few moments in late night or in the morning. So if you are planning your trip ""on site"", keep in mind this, so printed flyers become your best friends lol.

starosa,2,,2008-10-31,COUPLES,2008-12-31,1,Never Again!,"Made the mistake of booking through Hotwire where they listed this property as a 3 star when its really a dismal 2.  Worst Front Desk  service....they barely acknowledges your presense.   Hotel is listed as a Hollywood property but its on the way end of Hollywood and not such a great part of town.   Parking is excessive at $15 - plenty of street parking.  Breakfast is a joke.  Rooms were small.  Elevators? - plan on waiting 3-5 minutes to get to your room and there are no stairways as an option to the super slow elevators.  Only positive thing to mention is the free internet service and maid service and room was clean.  ok for 1 night, but not beyond that.",,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,2.0,hollywoodhotel,General Manager,2010-09-26,"We are very happy you selected Hollywood Hotel - The Hotel of Hollywood as your destination to the Hollywood / Los Angeles area and all the hotel cast members appreciate this very much as we realize there are other hotel options available to you.

 I am sorry you believe our star rating is incorrect.  Even though the hotel has passed AAA's rigorous 3 Diamond guidelines, Hotwire's star rating is rated by Hotwire guests themselves like you.

I am sorry you  had to wait for our Front Desk cast member to finish a call before he could check you in. Most generally our check-in procedure is smooth and quick and I agree he should have acknowledged your presence and customer service is priority number one!

As the our name states we are in Hollywood and we are the closest hotel to Mount Hollywood which is straight up Vermont Avenue in Griffith Park, which is where the Griffith Observatory and the Greek theatre and the Hollywood Sign are.

I'm sorry you did not enjoy our complimentary hot buffet breakfast served daily from 6:30am - 10:30 am which has, eggs, sausage, waffles, bagels, cream cheese, fruit, coffee, teas, milk, a variety of cereals, muffins, rolls, wheat and white breads, a variety of juices and more in our Italian designed restaurant ... Valentino's.  If there are some items missing on the menu you wished were included, please list them and we will put them in.

We have beautifully landscaped gated parking with a 24/7 parking attendant which cost $18 per day plus 10% tax with unlimited in and out priviliedges.   I'm sorry to say...unless you have a parking permit, parking on almost any street overnight in Los Angeles will undoubtedly cost you more if you get a parking citation than parking in the hotel's gated lot. Almost every hotel in Los Angeles charges more than $25 plus 10% tax per night for parking. The Hollywood Hotel only charges $18 plus 10% tax. 

Now, if you like to play musical chairs, then you probably will like playing musical parking space. You can park in the residential side streets around the hotel without a permit and for the most part without time restrictions unless it's a street cleaning day and you will get a citation if you don't move your car on those days as well. There will be somewhat of a walk to and from the hotel and your car, plus it will be unpredictable to even find a space as many of the residents park on the street as well. 

All the street parking around the hotel is metered and good for a few hours before you have to reload the meter. If you oversleep and don't reload the meter, you might get a citation too.

Like I said, the hotel lot is gated and manned 24 hours by an attendant and is probably one prettiest landscaped parking lots in the city and very easy access to and from the hotel. 

We have 3 elevators in the hotel for only 4 floors, so waiting 3-5 minutes as highly exaggerated as it only takes 36 seconds to go from the 1st floor to the top floor. Yes, I timed it.  We also have an open staircase right next to the elevators if you wish to use them.

I'm glad you used and enjoed our complimentary Wifi Internet Service which has 24/7 complimentary connectivity tech support.

Finally, I would like to say that we value you as our guest and appreciate your business. If I can ever do anything for you on a return visit to Los Angles please do not hesitate to contact me.

The website does mention this actually, we learnt after it was too late. The Front desk just did what they had to do without a smile. Not rude but not welcoming either. The room was clean, the bed comfortable, the bathroom clean with a nice shower. The room opened into a courtyard in the back which was nice. Nice location for Hollywood. Breakfast was included.",,3.0,3.0,,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,9
SquibGuy,1,,2008-12-31,SOLO,2008-12-09,1,Horrible experence,"When a family member is hospitalized, you usually have enough on your mind. Having to stay the night in town I needed somewhere close. This hotel seemed like a good place since I could walk to the hospital, but it turned out to be a nightmare.

First upon checking in I noticed they made a photocopy of my drivers license. When I asked why they needed that, I got about five different explanations, none of which seemed believable. They even threw in 9/11 to try to make it seem like it was a matter of security.

Exhausted, I went to my room turned on the heater and went to sleep only to wake up in the morning freezing cold. I went to the front desk and was told that the hotel heater was out and that I should use the space heater that was in the closet. There wasn't one in the closet. After about 30 minutes someone finally brought one to me. By that time the room was so cold it would have taken hours to heat the place up.
I switched on my laptop to do some work only to find out that the internet wasn't working. A short conversation with the front desk confirmed that the internet was down. They were willing to give me free access via the TV Web service. That would have been fine except I wasn't interested in looking at PerezHilton. I wanted to get my corporate email.

And speaking of the TV, I found that the remote would only work if I stood in the middle of the room. Otherwise the remote was useless.
While waiting at the front desk to complain about everything that was wrong, I overhead another ""guest"" being told by one of the staff ""That is our policy and if you don't like it you don't have to stay here"". I have no idea what they were complaining about, but the staff member was very rude and was that way in front of several other ""guests"" besides myself.

The manager then listened to my complaints and did nothing to make me feel like they cared. He simply nodded and acted like he couldn't get rid of me fast enough.

I have done a lot of traveling and I have to say this was the worst experience I have ever had at a hotel. I must travel back to the area next month and I will not be staying there and doubt that I will ever stay in another Ramada again.",,1.0,1.0,,2.0,1.0,2.0,hollywoodhotel,General Manager,2010-09-26,"Dear SquibGuy,

According wikipedia a Squib is a miniature explosive device used in a wide range of industries, from special effects to military applications. They resemble tiny sticks of dynamite, both in appearance and construction, although with considerably less explosive power. I learn something new everyday. Thanks.

We are very happy that you selected Hollywood Hotel - the Hotel of Hollywood as your destination to the Hollywood / Los Angeles area and all the hotel cast members appreciate this very much as we realize there are other hotel options available to you.

I am sorry you had a family member in one of the three hospitals near us.  As the only hotel near to Kaiser Hospital, children's Hospital of Los Angeles and Hollywood Presbyterian Hospital we have many families staying with us during these difficult times when their loved ones are nearby.

Sorry about the internet being down but the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power were fixing something in the middle of Vermont Avenue one day and when they dug up the street, they also dug up the main AT&t Telephone and Internet trunk lines which severed all telephone and Internet communications for about 4 days till it got fixed.  Needless to say, this will never happen again as we installed redundant Internet cable systems using Time Warner cable and their cable lines travel under the sidewalk.  

We have replaced all our TV's with 37"" LCD flat screen LG Televisions.  The remote problem happens when the batteries inside the remote start to weaken.  The weaker the batteries are, the weaker the signal.  Our housekeepers test the remotes daily. A flashing light when any button is pushed indicates weak batteries. Sometimes, the batteries go weak when the guest is in the room using the remote. The simple fix is to ask for another remote from the front desk.

Finally, I would like to say that we value you as our guest and appreciate your business. If I can ever do anything for you on a return visit to Los Angles please do not hesitate to contact me.

Buckinghamshireman,5,,2008-10-31,BUSINESS,2008-12-04,4,"Good basic hotel, value for money","I stayed here in october for nine days and found the hotel to be perfectly fine.  I think it's worth mentioning that as I am British my expectations will be different to those from other countries, so whilst this review isn't aimed solely at Brits, it definitely has that perspective.

The first room I was put into was 103 - remembering that in the US the ground floor is called the first floor.  I moved from this room as soon as I could because although it was a good room and easy to get out of without using the lifts, the receptionist told me that they have event nights in the bar downstairs and one of the nights it was a club.  I could definitely hear music etc before I moved rooms to the 3rd floor.  

Both rooms were great.  The shower was hot and strong and the bed was good quality with decent bedlinen.  I couldn't fault the room at all.  Breakfast was continental European, and there was lots of it, much better than I have had in other hotels in the same range.

The reception was clean and tidy and the receptionists were generally helpful.  Only one of the younger girls had some kind of attitude and made me feel stupid for asking about the car park, the rest were all very helpful.  Although the car park was a little expensive it was safe and had lots of spaces.

The hotel was well placed for me, only with trips down to Santa Monica did I feel the distance, even then at the right time of day, it's not so bad.  I don't know why they say it's near Universal, because it's not.  In real terms it's a twenty minute drive at least.

I looked at lots of hotels in this price range and as I drove around LA checked a few of them out - they were really grotty and I was very pleased I hadn't stayed in them.

Whilst the area the hotel is in isn't great, it isn't that bad either and reasonably safe enough to walk around in at night.  It has to be remembered that walking ANYWHERE in LA at night isn't such a great idea, unless you're in one of the shopping districts.  

I felt perfectly safe and when I come again with my family I would stay in the hotel quite happily. There are some restraunts nearby, I drove five minutes up to the House of pies one night - great nosh, reasonably priced and further up in Los Feliz there are some trendy bars and cafes.

I tried the swimming pool one day and despite the hot weather it was BITTERLY cold.  You don't need to take a towel though, as they provide them by the pool.

As with everything you get what you pay for and my experience was that this is a reasonably priced hotel and offers good value for money.",,4.0,3.0,,3.0,4.0,3.0,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-30,"Dear Guest,

juliasuzanne,27,"Pontefract, United Kingdom",2008-11-30,COUPLES,2008-11-15,4,Good value for money,"I was worried about staying here after reading some of the reviews on Trip Advisor, but I was pleasantly surprised.

The reception and lobby are nicely decorated and I found the staff to be friendly and helpful.  

I booked a junior suite as it didn't cost much more than a double room and I was very glad I did.  The room was very spacious with a sofa and coffee table, desk and dining area, kitchen with microwave, coffee maker and fridge, walk in wardrobe and a large double bed which was very comfortable.  The room was very clean with plenty of towels, complimentary toiletries and hairdryer in the bathroom.  

Housekeeping were excellent and when the do not disturb sign was used we were not bothered.  They would always come back later in the day.

We took our laptop as the room had free wifi but the connection was intermittent at best.  There were times you couldn't log on for hours which was irritating, but we weren't there to spend all day on the computer so it wasn't too much of a problem.

The buffet breakfast (which is included in the room rate) was excellent.  There were sausages, eggs, fresh waffles, cereals, toast, bagels, juice etc and you could eat as much as you wanted.

Many people have complained about the lift being slow but I didn't think it was that bad.  I was on holiday so I wasn't in a hurry anyway.

The gift shop on the first floor was very handy as it sold drinks and snacks which were much cheaper than the vending machines.  There was also an ATM but it charged $5 per transaction so we never used it.  There is one over the road at a liquor store which only charged $1.50.

The location of the hotel isn't great but I think that's reflected in the rate.  I simply couldn't afford to stay at a decent place in a good location and a nice hotel in a not so nice location was a fair compromise for me.  

I don't think the area around the hotel was particularly dodgy, there's just not much there for tourists and there's nothing nearby that's within walking distance.  However, there is a bus stop right outside the hotel and the subway is less than 5 minutes walk away.  The public transport in LA is excellent and I had no problem getting around.  Its also very cheap with a day pass costing only $5.

This is a great hotel for people on a budget and its also ideal for anyone relying on public transport to get around.",,5.0,4.0,,3.0,5.0,5.0,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-30,"Dear Guest,

zed132,1,,2008-11-30,COUPLES,2008-11-11,4,Great for the cost,"After reading previous reviews, we were a little worried about the state of this hotel.  We were very surprised at how nice it actually was.  The room was clean and modern. No bedbugs like other reviews had mentioned.   A little small but had a mini fridge and microwave.  We were lucky enough to have a room that had a balcony facing the courtyard so we did not hear any of the street noise.  The hotel is pet friendly and I have severe allergies.  The staff was more then accommodating to a room on the 3rd floor that was not pet friendly.   The breakfast served every morning was great considering it was included.  I couldn't complain about fresh made waffles, eggs, sausage and toast.  It was a great start to our mornings.  We had brought our laptop with us because the rooms have free internet and were glad we did because the computer in the lobby was out of order and expensive.  The staff was very helpful and pleasant with our tourist type questions.  The area that the hotel was in was nice enough during the day, but a little dodgy at night.  I wouldn't recommend walking around after 9pm.  Less then a 5 min walk to the subway station. Rite aid and Payless shoes right next door.  A car is recommended.  Everything in LA is very spread out and the transit took a long time.  Some of the bus routes had some interesting characters on them and went through some scary parts of town.

rsupergirl,6,"Fresno, California",2008-10-31,FRIENDS,2008-10-07,2,Disappointed,"We stayed two nights in this hotel, and if our stay had been longer, I would have seriously considered moving to another place.  

Check-in was really unimpressive.  We asked about parking at the Pantages Theatre, just a few miles away, and the two clerks just looked at each other.  OK, so they're not theatre people.... The first sign that they had our reservations wrong was on the breakfast ticket – dated only for one night.  We took it back to the desk clerk after breakfast the next morning.  No problem, she simply penned the correction on the ticket.  When we got back to our room at 10:30 that night, neither one of our cards worked.  Back downstairs, we were issued two new cards – no apology offered.

A small buffet breakfast was served.  Both mornings the hot food offered was waffles and sausages.  There was no sweetener for the coffee.  My waffle was cold and hard.  No matter, even hot they weren’t that tasty.

The room itself was decent, though very small.  The smoke detector seemed to be missing its batteries, and the full-length mirror faced the toilet.  There was no blanket on the bed, only the flat sheet and comforter.  Wireless Internet was also offered, but the connection was so slow that it was unusable.

The towels, which we hung up to re-use the next day, were replaced by fresh new ones.  So much for their eco-friendliness.  (But maybe that had more to do with the maid thinking that we were there for only one night?)

And don’t bother with the “Do not disturb” door hangers.  The maids knock anyway when they come by.  Yes, both mornings they knocked and tried to come in.

On the plus side, this hotel was exceedingly quiet.  Most hotels have the heavy pneumatic doors that slam closed behind you.  Not this one.  I was thankful for that because it’s a pet peeve of mine that other guests don’t try to cushion the slam when they come in late at night or when they leave early in the morning.   We never heard any other guests once we were in our room -- it was as if there was no one else on our floor.",,2.0,3.0,,3.0,3.0,4.0,hollywoodhotel,General Manager,2010-09-26,"Dear rsupergirl,

We are very happy you selected the Hollywood Hotel - The Hotel of Hollywood as your destination to the Hollywood / Los Angeles area and all the hotel cast members appreciate this very much as we realize there are other hotel options available to you.

 I am sorry you had  an unimpressive checkin with our front desk cast member. Most generally our check-in procedure is smooth and quick and I agree a check in should be impressive.  I wish you eleborated how we could have impressed you as we are always looking to hear new ideas. 

I'm glad you liked our non slamming door closers.  The ""Do Not Disturb"" signs have been replaced with a new electronic notification system to ensure maids do not disturb guests in the future.  By the guest simply turning the deadbolt on the lock from inside the guest room, the lock indicator on the outside turns red informing the housekeeper to check back later.  If the indicator is green the housekeeper will knock three times before entering the guest room. 

Finally, I would like to say that we value you as our guest and appreciate your business. If I can ever do anything for you on a return visit to Los Angles please do not hesitate to contact me.

KMK0,1,,2008-09-30,NONE,2008-10-07,4,Great Value for the price,"After reading the reviews, we nearly cancelled.  So glad we didn't.  Hotel was really good.  They reduced their price the week before we went, an email to the Manager and they changed my price to the new one - a saving of $45 a night.

Some of the front office staff were not as helpful as others - but worked out fine in the end.

Room was clean and tidy, with sliding door onto patio.  Breakfast was really good - breakfast cereal was nice and fresh, waffles freshly made whilst you wait.  Friendly breakfast lady.

Swimming pool area was great, with towels supplied.  Water was a bit cold.

Area around the hotel a bit dirty - but if you walked up to shops near Los Feliz (about 5 min walk) - nice Thai restaurant with friendly staff, Supermarket and Rite-Aid.

Easy access to Universal by Metro, also went to Santa Monica, Hollywood walk of fame etc - great central location.

Jackie B,82,"Bridgend, United Kingdom",,,2008-10-07,4,Great value for money,"I stayed here from 19 - 23 Sept (4 nights) and after some of the reviews I'd seen beforehand, I was apprehensive about what the hotel was going to be like.

Fortunately, everything was fine.  Yes, the hotel is a bit ""dated"" but it's clean, the room was great and it has plenty of facilities (fridge, microwave, coffee, internet access, free breakfast, swimming pool, etc)  What do you expect for the money?!  I really do think that some people want a 5 star hotel experience for the cost of a 2/3 star and when they don't get it, they write a bad review.  I think if you want a 5 star hotel, pay for a 5 star hotel and then write a bad review if it doesn't live up to your expectations!

Anyway, back to the hotel:
Good points 
1. Great location for metro and buses.  Don't even think about driving in LA - it took us an hour to go 5 miles!  Metro is clean and safe and only $5 for a day pass.
2. Great room facilities - A/C, fridge, microwave, coffee in china mugs and the most fantastic bed I've ever slept in - great night's sleep!  
3. FREE breakfast - yes, FREE!  A rarity in USA and very nice it was too.  Hot eggs, sausage, waffles, pastries, toast, breads, cereals, juice, milk, tea and coffee.  The same every day but very tasty and enough to keep you going til lunchtime.
4. Hotel facilities - ice machine was great, didn't use the swimming pool but wandered around to it and it looked lovely.
5. Staff - very friendly and helpful

Bad points
1. Lift was slow
2. Not enough restaurants within walking distance.  Plenty of fast food places (Pizza Hut, McDonald's, etc) but not enough ""nice"" restaurants for me.

Overall, I'm pleased with the hotel and would certainly recommend it to others for a couple of days stay.",,,,,,,,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-30,"Dear Guest,

roadtaken,5,,,,2008-09-18,4,The Original!,"This hotel is not retro it is the original! 

 Near a  Metro Station with a bus stop right in front it is convenient to  Universal Studios and Los Feliz, a trendy art  district where film crews are frequently seen.

An air of fifties Hollywood glamor remains in the details of this hotel. Stylized metal palm leaves, granite floors reminiscent of the Hollywood Stars at Graumans Chinese Theatre, interior balconies open to the stars and rooms updated with modern amenities and a comfortable bed made this hotel stay an unexpected pleasure. 

The attractive landscaped pool area is a welcome place to cool off and relax. 

The breakfast was plentiful including a waffle table with lots of juice and coffee. I appreciated the ceramic mugs in both the room and at breakfast instead of foam containers.

After a late arrival I had delicious broiled shrimp and salad at a Salvadoran Restaurant across the street. Very reasonable; cash only. There are other dining options nearby.

The entire staff was friendly and helpful.

this hotel seems miles away. but let me tell you this hotel is SO lucky that its right near the metro & just as near to bus links. it is so convenient. bus which is 2 mins walk will take you to santa monica beach, the metro which is also 2 minutes will take you everywhere you need to go. 

the hotel itself, the elevator is a pain, but lets be realistic people your on holiday, if a slow elevator annoys you your just bein way too over the top. our room overlooked the courtyard, i reckon the other side of the hotel had been redecorated. anyway the bed was brilliant, room had a fridge, a wee bit of the wallpaper was peelin in the bathroom, it was clean, fresh and no complaints. 

the pool was great, quiet & located just outside the hotel.

i walked out at night approx between 11pm, & even at 2am to go get food yes its dark outside people just like everywhere else & yes there are groups of people hanging about, like everywhere else, my girlfriend who is 24 went out at this time and we are still both alive to tell the tale.

im saving the best for last - breakfast. it really irritates me as i use this site as a guage for picking hotels. the person who said his children couldnt have cereal, well the couldve had fresh baked waffles, eggs, sausage, toast, fruit, fruit juice, croissants, pastrys, it was brilliant and just for the record when i was there for 4 nights there was never a lack of cereal... the breakfast was brilliant. 

all in all consider this hotel as its much cheaper than in hollywood, you can get to where it all happens is 20 minutes, you can get a free breakfast and save a lot of money. great stay.",,5.0,5.0,,5.0,3.0,5.0,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-27,"Dear Guest,

The rooms are nice and although I only had a smaller room it still had a microwave and refridgerator. They offer a free hot buffet breakfast in the morning and the in room wi fi worked perfectly. The grounds and parking lots are nicely decorated with palm trees and a waterfall.

Everything is clean and well cared for and this is an excellent place to stay if you need to be in the Hollywood or downtown area. About the only negative is the area.

lcoles,17,,2008-08-31,FAMILY,2008-09-02,1,Wouldn't stay here again,"Room was damp smelling, airconditioner was noisy and dripping. The fridge looked like it had been salvaged from the local rubbish tip.  On our first night, we saw security officers patrolling the corridors and saw Police Officers at one room.  Breakfast was awful with no cereal for our children apart from bran flakes ... that was the ONLY cereal they had.  From a hotel chain like the Ramada, you expect more.  We had been travelling across America on Route 66 staying mostly in Best Westerns and only booked this hotel as we couldn't get a Best Western. The rate was pricey for what we got.  Breakfast restaurant was hotel prices for awful food, our waffles were rock hard. Probably re-heated.  We would have been better going to Dennys.  There appeared to be some unsavoury people hanging around the corridors and we got the impression that some people were living there.  Final straw came when we were waiting with our daughters a the lift when a 6'5"" man, dressed as a woman in an emerald green cat suit got out of the lift with what appeared to be a runner for a TV company.  As they walked away, the whole back side of his pants were cut out revealing all.  Not the sort of thing you want your children to see in a hotel lobby.  Maybe they were filming an episode for Jerry Springer?  Staff were unhelpful and churlish.

davdaven,6705,"Richmond, California",2008-07-31,BUSINESS,2008-08-04,2,"Great Location, Poor Hotel","The Ramada Hollywood Hotel is well situated just one block from the Metro Red Line subway and two separate Metro Rapid bus lines. I found the location convenient for business and pleasure and used public transit for the duration of my stay. This hotel is ideal for business travelers and tourists who do not want to rent a car.

Locational advantages notwithstanding, I do not recommend this hotel to anyone. During my stay, the hotel itself was sorely lacking on many fronts:

-The elevators are very, very slow, and the stairs are roped off as emergency exits only.
-My room (one queen) was smaller than average.
-The television set did not work well, and the cable went in and out every night.
-The floor in my room was stained, and the comforter was severely worn.
-The bathtub was elevated far above floor level, resulting in unsafe entry/exit and a lack of headroom. I am able-bodied and nearly fell getting out of the tub EVERY night. And at 6'1"" my head was uncomfortably close to the ceiling.
-My room was remade despite hanging up the ""Do Not Disturb"" sign. I inquired at the front desk and was informed that I should stop by every morning and request that my room not be remade. For the record, I did that the next three days and they did not enter my room.
-Each room facing the courtyard has a patio, but the patios have no chairs. And because the courtyard is so small, there is no privacy.
-Access to the swimming pool is through the parking lot, and it closes early (8 PM). Also, there is no hot tub.
-Breakfast is served in the basement, which requires a painfully slow elevator trip. I was in a hurry every morning and was disappointed at the lack of ""portable"" pastries and fruit that could be consumed on my way to the subway station.

The Ramada is located near L.A. City College ""somewhere"" between Hollywood, Little Armenia, and Silverlake but not actually in any of the three. The neighborhood is walkable but a bit worn in, and I suggest that women be careful walking around by themselves at night. There are several nearby restaurants of varying quality, but the best are a healthy trek away. I walked to them, but most people would be better off driving. There is a Rite Aid at the corner of Santa Monica, but the nearest grocery store is located north at Hollywood (not too far from the restaurants at Prospect).

At $105/night (20% discount for staying >3 nights), the Ramada is not a bargain. Parking is $15/night, which didn't matter for me, but is a bit steep for this part of L.A.! I feel ripped off. Well, I feel like my company got ripped off! Really, the only redeeming feature of the Ramada itself was my ability to print out my Southwest boarding pass before heading to the airport. If the subway station weren't a block away, this hotel would probably devolve into some cheap motel of last resort.

Overall, I suggest you look elsewhere. This place won't kill you or give you bed bugs--I survived here for four nights--but this is not the way to see L.A. I'll be staying elsewhere next time.",,2.0,3.0,,4.0,2.0,3.0,,,,,89
andeonta,3,,2008-08-31,FRIENDS,2008-08-04,3,"Come on people, it wasn't that bad....","There wasn't anything wrong with this hotel.  Judging by most of the reviews, I thought I was in for it.  However, when we arrived, the front desk was very helpful.  We got there awhile before check-in time and the associate personally went to our room to check if it was cleaned.  It was, and we proceeded straight to our room.

Breakfast was fine...it was the same every morning but what more can you expect for breakfast other than eggs, sausage, juice, coffee and waffles.

Location is excellent.  I had a car and a GPS and everything was within 10-15 minutes.

The room was a little small but sufficient.  We had a balcony facing the side street which blocked the street noise.  The bathroom was fine with a large stand-up shower.  We also had a small couch and coffee table. The beds were very comfortable.

The hotel also had a pool which was nice and refreshing.

The only small problem we had was with our electronic room key...which the front desk fixed right away in 5 minutes.

Overall, I think I would go back.  For those people that gave this hotel bad reviews would probably have complaints about the St. Regis because they are so superficial.  Give me a break.",,3.0,3.0,,5.0,3.0,3.0,,,,,2

This hotel is a little away from major tourists route but the Met system is easy to use and the area is safe,we walked to Hollywood at night with no concerns.
There are plenty of shops around so cheap food etc is available.The breakfast staff are great esp at Ramada Romulus DTW,she is a gem.
The good thing about Ramada is one phone call or web search gets you guaranteed best price,no stuffing around on websites,very handy when travelling.

julieann2200,3,,2008-07-31,SOLO,2008-07-28,2,Less than So-So,"I thought the best aspect of this hotel was the location, less than a block away from the Metro Station. Also the continental breakfast was acceptable.  While the lobby and the lower levels were attractive, there were several problems with my stay. The elevator service was terrible. The elevator closest to my room rarely worked. The doors to the stairs were marked emergency exits, and indicated that alarms would go off, so I was stuck using the elevators. 

My room was a bit dingy. Gum was stuck to the carpeting and the furniture looked very worn and stained. The bathroom was not clean. Hair and soap were stuck to the walls. The bathtub was clogged and the TV and remote did not work properly. The TV was a plasma screen and looked nice, including a keyboard that was supposedly available for Internet access. So I signed up for the service and found that the TV and keyboard did not work properly. I was charged for the internet anyway. I had a technician come up and unclogged the bathtub but he could not fix the internet and TV problems.  

I had to make sure I put ""Do Not Disturb"" on my door because housekeeping sometimes came early in the morning. I found my door did not lock when I closed it sometimes. 

The internet terminal in the lobby seemed to only accept credit cards and charged minimum $5.00 for each log on.  The first day I was there there was water dripping above the terminal. Then It did not work for several days of my stay and didn't come up again for the last day of my stay. 

The ATM charged a $5.00 service fee and did not work sometimes. The vending machines did not often work as well. Rite Aid had an ATM that only charged $2.00. 

The hotel charged $15.00 a day for parking, which is not bad considering what you pay elsewhere. However the attendants always asked for something different on the way out. Some asked for the entrance ticket while others asked me to pull off the rear view ticket the hotel issued. I did not use my car as much because of the availability of the Metro. 

The neighborhood was immigrant lower middle class. There were some homeless people wandering around. I found people were generally approachable in the neighborhood and I also liked the dollar store a few steps away from the hotel. 

I'm not sure I would choose this hotel again. Not a three star hotel, two at the most.",,2.0,2.0,,2.0,2.0,2.0,,,,,2

We needed the room for one night in order to visit the nearby hospital in the morning.  The room was clean, and parking was easy.  However, the elevator did not work, and there was a sign in it telling people not to panic if the doors didn't open.  Luckily, we managed to get a ground-floor room.  The lounge wasn't open because, as the obviously bored desk clerk told us, ""the bartender isn't here.""  No other explanation was offered and she made no attempt to apologize or to offer alternatives.  Someone was cooking garlic in the basement (where a restaurant is, apparently, that you can't get to by elevator) and the smell was overpowering.

jezeca,42,,2008-06-30,COUPLES,2008-07-11,4,Absolutly Fine and Pleasant!,"After reading a number of bad reviews about this hotel, we were a little dubious about staying here, but all those reveiws were nothing like what we got.
We arrived five hours early and still able to check into our room straight away! Everything was clean and the room was lovely. Provided with a fridge wihich helped to store drinks, as well as a microwave and tea and coffee facilities. 
The hotel is in a great location, altough there isnt much around the actual hotel except for a few food places such as subway, pizza hut etc the metro station is less then a 5 minute walk and we used this with ease everyday for only $5 for an unlimited day pass on the trains and buses. Also an internet cafe across the street for only $3 an hour. I woudnt say the area is dangerous, always felt safe walking around at night, infact it was alwys pretty empty, even at the weekend.
Breakfast in the morning was fine for a complimentary breakfast and offered cereal, toast, bagels, eggs, sausages, waffles, fruit and drinks. 
Swimming pool area was nicely decorated and clean, also liked how it was quite hidden away so you didnt have people looking over you all the time.
One thing i would say is that the reception always try to tell you that the best way to get around is by taxi if you dont have a car. But just use the public transport if you can, its a lot cheaper and we got everywhere we wanted to go eg. Hollywood, Beverly Hills and Rodeo Drive, Santa Monica, Pasadena and Downtown.

2eskimos,132,"Livermore, California",2008-07-31,BUSINESS,2008-07-09,2,"Not Worth Checking Out, Even For the Price","I've had the pleasure to be in Los Angeles, for a five week stint, on business.  For three of those weeks, my coworker and I booked rooms at this hotel.  They have excellent promotional prices and it was close to work.

On the exterior, the hotel appears quite nice.  They are doing heavy renovations (converting the hotel to The Hollywood Hotel), at this time, so if you're not in the mood for construction noise, stay away- and they work until 7:00pm at night.  The interior is quite old fashioned and looks quite tired.

The rooms themself are a collection of a bunch of old hotel furniture thrown together.  The first week, I stayed in a dingy, smelly room, but figured I'd deal with it, while my coworker's room looked a couple of notches better than mine.  The next couple of weeks, my room was a bit nicer, but still not really up to snuff.  They claim free wireless internet for all rooms, and although they have wireless routers all over the building, the connections are very weak and the connection is only 2Mbps.  They claim hard data connections (10Mbps), but we found that the connections were hidden behind the bedside tables, far from the desk, and they only provide very short cables, so you're teathered to that nightstand.

In all the years of staying in hotels, never has the housecleaning staff forgotten to clean my room, until now.  I walked into the room, turned on the lights only to find that my bed hadn't even been made.  I returned late at night, so it wasn't possible to get it done.  My coworker's Internet didn't work at all- his cable connection is down and he can't get a consistent wireless signal.  One night, he returned to his room to find that the housecleaning staff had removed his shower curtain, but neglected to replace it.  His room for the last two weeks had water problems, like it would be black water when he turned it on, so he would have to let it run for a couple of minutes, before using it.

On the upside, the parking is secure, albiet you'll pay $15 per night, and a hot breakfast is included with your stay every morning.  But after three weeks, powdered eggs and sausage links gets tiring.",,2.0,1.0,,4.0,2.0,2.0,,,,,50

I wouldnt walk around the area at night, but than again i wouldn't walk any where in LA at night period!

Ok now the rooms, very comfy, yes some were small (8 ppl in our group, 6 rooms), but ours had a flat screen tv, a micro wave, mini fridge, ironing board, coffee maker, tile floor with area rug, really nice bed spread, lots of outlets for charging electronics, closet/hangers, desk, bureau with 6 drawers, lots of room for clothing, bathroom has somewhat of a weak fan some of the silver accents were rusted but who cares, the bathroom was NOT mildew infested, seamed very clean, massaging showerhead (positioned very low, btw) you also get free paper in the lobby, and free breakfast every morning, yes it was somewhat monotnis but if you were wise with your choices you could break it up and still have a decent experience, i hate to be repetative but i will list the stuff that was available: First there were 3 kinds of cereal ( raisin bran, rice crispies & I cant remember the 3rd) next was the milk and OJ, then some eggs and sausage linx, then was the waffles made to order station, they were pretty good BTW, then was some canned fruit and a tray of Crossants and other breads including whole wheat toast and all the trimmings, butter, jelly, cream cheese and then the coffee station, so ya see? you can totally have cereal one day, eggs, sausage and toast another day, a waffle another day.....u see where im going here?  we had the balcony overlooking the courtyard, which 2 foreigners and a bunch of teenagers who failed to realize that there voices were echoing thru the courtyard, but thats not the hotels fault, but if your really into your sleep i would request a room where the balcony dosnt face the courtyard.  As far as the pool, i didnt look for it cuz it was way too cold and i didnt visit the gym either so i have nothing to report on that.  The elevators unfortunately are very slow so just make sure u alot yourself enuff time to meet in the lobby or down for breakfast.  Parking was $12 a day plus tax wich was fine, at least we knew we had our van in a safe place.  If you have a vehicle your basically a 1/2 hr from everything u wanna see.  Well thats about it, no its not the Ritz but if your looking for something under $100 bux a night, so u can shower and sleep, there is nothing wrong with this hotel!!  OH very imprtant, make sure you look at your bill upon check out, they tried to charge one of our party for movies he never rented, when front desk and manager were confronted there response was ""im sorry but we have to charge you""  WTF?  Anyway, he eventually got the charges take off but just be carefull!!",,5.0,3.0,,3.0,4.0,5.0,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-30,"Dear Guest,

johnallanuk,80,"Alloa, United Kingdom",2008-04-30,SOLO,2008-05-02,4,"Great Hotel, Good Location and excellent public transport links.","Getting to the hotel is the easiest journey I've had on this current multi city tour of the States.

To save over $100 on taxi fare, get the Flyaway Bus outside the airport to Union Station then get the Metro Red route to Vermont / Santa Monica station.  The hotel is 200 yards up the street.  It has the slightest incline but don't worry if your bags have wheels.

The Internet TV is poor but the hotel offers free wireless access.  Great if you brought your laptop but if you didn't - use the Internet Cafe across the street  $3 per hour.

The room was clean, comfortable  and the hotel also has a car hire facility.   Breakfasts were great with a huge array of waffles, toast, cereal, coffee, juice, sausages and scrambled eggs.   

The only thing I found a bit of a challenge is that they don't seem to do the cross selling of their offerings very well.  For example, there is a gift shop which I only discovered on my final day there.  The hotel service directory needs and update and although the hotel has comedy nights I frequently found the posters advertising this were displayed after I left the hotel that morning and the event was over by the time I got back.

I would highly recommend this hotel for its proximity to Universal Studios and the Kodak Theater.   Use the Metro if you can.  Universal City is the stop for the Studios  only 7 stops away (15 minutes) and the Kodak Theater & Chinese Theater are just a few steps away from one another, again on the RED Route.  Check out   http://socaltransport.org/tm_pub_start.php for more details on getting around.   

The Metro is very clean.  However, if you want to take the bus to the Chinese Theatre, use route 217 which you can pick up 200 yards up the street which will take you straight to it.  The cost is the same as the metro $1.25 but takes slightly longer.

Shame the hotel doesn't display this information on its website too.",,3.0,4.0,,3.0,3.0,4.0,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-30,"Dear Guest,

They had a nice duvet and comfortable beds.  The breakfast buffet was the same every day but with plenty of variety.  The front desk let us cancel a room we didn't need the day we got there which was against policy!  The only negative I could say was the temperature control in the rooms were not working properly. My room was freezing and my sisters room was very warm.  The comedy show was comedians practicing to be comedians and their comedian friends were there to laugh for them!!!  Kind of funny to see!
Also a local Salsa dance club there Fri. night - So it has some entertainment and fun to watch. - free for hotel guests to enter both!  It was definitely a good location by the subway.
We had fun and was pleasantly surprised even though it is an older hotel.  Great for universal studios with the subway right there!  I would book there again.",,,,,,,,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-30,"Dear Guest,

Siwa78,3,,2008-03-31,FRIENDS,2008-04-01,2,Mmmm....have had better,"We arrived at the end of our trip into LA. The area was fine, what part of Hollywood, Downtown doesn't have a homeless person and isn't full of fast food places? We were driving by car, but would also recommend the metro. I wouldn't walk alone there at night however, but that also applies to a large percentage of LA. The hotel itself was fine, the rooms are good. Ask in advance for a 2nd or 3rd floor room. 1st floor is actually ground level and the rooms come right up to the reception area. 
We personally had a bad experience here and I wouldn't want to put everyone off as it was only staff related. We found a human hair ball on a bath towel and got no apologies from staff until I asked for one. 
The pool is nice, just not heated! Staff are helpful with tourist info.
Be weary, most celebrity house tours are fake. Top celebs live on private roads up in the hills. 
Parking is $11 + tax/day, which is very cheap for California!
Breakfast is worth missing. Unless you're happy with plain cereal, dried egg, interesting looking sausages, waffles, toast and some canned peaches. It's fine for a small bite, but if you love breakfast go to a local diner. Loads of places to eat nearby!",,2.0,1.0,,3.0,2.0,1.0,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-04-29,"Dear Guest...

The area of the hotel isn't the best, quite a few homeless people, etc, but heck, the Metro station is about 2 blocks away, we took that everyday and saved a lot of money.  

We checked in, even a bit earlier and yes the rooms are small, but we were on vacation and didn't plan on spending much time in there anyways.  We had a room on the 3rd floor and with one queen bed, TV, coffee maker and a small fridge (perfect as we picked up beer from the Rite Aid down the street).  The elevators are SLOW and we didn't go into the pool as it was just a bit too cold.  The free breakfast was okay, the waffles were good, can't complain when it's free!

Room was small of course and breakfast got old quick, but at least there was one.  Area was not the nicest in L.A. Parking was a rip off.

lrp124,34,,2008-02-29,COUPLES,2008-02-26,4,Enjoyed our stay,"We booked our room at the Ramada because we got a really good rate of $67.50 a night though the hotel website.  This was a promotional rate when you stayed 3 or more nights, we received a % off.  

We were in a Queen bedroom.  My only complaint was that the room was really small.  I'm sure the king and two bed rooms are larger but we didn't see them.  
But for the price, I really didn't care about the size of our room because it still had everything you need even a small fridge and a microwave.  The hotel is nice and clean, but you can tell it is a little older.
We had a small balcony and could even see the hollywood sign from our window.

There isn't much in walking distance.  If you have a car the location is convenient to all the attractions.

The hotel includes a free breakfast which is mostly continental stuff.  For a free breakfast it was good.

There was even a free comedy show in the lounge on Monday nights that we went to and enjoyed.

RoadWearier,114,"Portland, Oregon",2007-12-31,BUSINESS,2007-12-22,1,a clear reminder of why I never stay at ramada,"Stayed here only because a business associate I was meeting was already booked here. The one bright spot of my stay was the very friendly & helpful Russian man who ran the gift shop. Now for the rest. Hotel internet down, so the utterly uninterested front desk staff sent me across the street to an ""internet cafe"": a dank hovel with squalid-looking men huddled over internet terminals available for rent by the hour. This is what the hotel staff considered an appropriate place for one of their guests? Would they have advised me to go there had I been a woman traveling alone? Probably so. In the morning, the breakfast buffet was above-average, but no to-go cups were available for coffee. Instead, there was a stack of cheap chinese ceramic mugs bearing the hotel's name - and a professionally-printed, posted sign warning guests not to remove the mugs from the breakfast area. Apparently, there was such a problem with the $300/night guests ""stealing"" their precious 50-cent mugs (because no to-go cups were available) that they had to erect a sign. If only there were a solution to this problem! Then the janitor set about to mop the entire tile floor along the only path leading into or out of the breakfast area - during breakfast! Apparently, none of the other twenty hours of the day was quite right for this job. I have seldom been confronted with such inertial stupidity during a hotel stay as during my 14 hours at this ramada (capitalization intentionally omitted). It has been over 15 years since my last ramada stay; hopefully it will be another 15 before my next.",,1.0,1.0,,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,,,139

But what we do expect is politeness, courteousness and some quiet when we trying to sleep. This we didn't get at this hotel. To start off, it's NOT in a good part of town, very scary! We tried to check in an hour early, which we have been able to do at every other hotel we've stayed in, and they rudely told us checkin was at 3:00! Not before! Then upon checkin, my husband asked where the pool was located and they gave him a piece of paper that was supposed to tell him. It wasn't even on there and when we found it ourselves, it wasn't heated. Information they could have shared at checkin.
The first night we were in bed by 9:00 and were woke up by vaccuming in the hall and actually hitting our door with the vaccum!

Since the Hotels.com doesn't allow for a split booking, we tried to get the one day at the same rate from the front desk when we checked in.  No dice.  

The room was clean but the lighting was very dim.  We booked a queen double and it came with a couch and small balcony.  The bathroom was small and we only had a shower.  My fiancee prefers a bath.

The free breakfast was simple but worthwhile.  Eggs, link sausage, real waffles, pastries, canned fruit, cereals, juices, milk and very good coffee.  

Wednesday and Monday nights there is a free comedy club in the bar.  At least it was free.

The surrounding neighborhood is not extremely desirable but it is OK.  Walking to the drugstore two blocks away was safe.

This hotel is a great choice if you want to party in the Hollywood, West Hollywood and (especially) the Silver Lake area. It is blocks from the Vermont Metro Subway  Station which takes you to Downtown, Hollywood Blvd and even Universal Studios in minutes. The staff is hit or miss - there have been times when they have been helpful and others when they have been indifferent. Don't expect gold star service, but I have never had a horrendous experience. Once we even upgraded to a larger room when there was a problem with our booking at no extra charge. The property is a little dated and unspectacular, but the rooms are clean and adequate. If you are expecting Hollywood ""glamour"" you will be sorely disappointed.

AlanWithAnEh,10,,2007-10-31,NONE,2007-10-16,4,"Simple, but no dive.","I booked this hotel after reading the mixed reviews here. I'll cut right to the chase - you get what you pay for. In LA tourist hotels, mostly in taxes, so make sure you know what taxes you should be getting charged for.

Contary to the beautiful pictures, they really are the only beautiful views in the hotel (the lobby fountain was turned off and dry - a bittersweet welcome). If you want light...oddly enough my girlfriend and I didn't think the rooms and hallways were lit well enough. Trust me...I'm really not too picky about my hotel stays, but you'll understand when you get there. They use lots of 60W CFL bulbs.

I was expecting that the photo of the room was likely taken from the doorway entrance to make it appear that the room is larger. It really is just the wall to the end of the bed. I'm 6'1"" and had to crouch in my shower. We had a decent balcony overlooking not much of the block of Vermont Ave. Vermont does change dramtically only one or two blocks northwards. Some very nice lounges and restaurants only 3 blocks up the street (e.g. Dresden's as seen in the movie Swingers)

Staff were quiet and friendly and very helpful to our questions about postage, internet and room fees.

It's a bit of a grubby neighborhood, but pretty safe. There's an affordable friendly Mom & Pop convenience store a half block down, a drug/variety/liquor store in the mall 3/4 blocks down and even a large office franchise store in that mall if you need copies, paperwork, etc. All amenities available...

Only huge down note was the bar downstairs. Way overpriced and poor timing for the entertainment (they leave the TVs on at the back bar with a comedy show in the lounge).

On the big plus side:

Wireless internet was free. We loved this for researching tour packages on my laptop. Don't take the tour from the hotel...way overpriced. Tons of coupons out there to take anywhere from $4-$10 off per person.

The continental breakfast was really good. It was not a simple continental breakfast as many other states. Fresh-cooked waffles with syrup, mini-bagels (can't toast  them though), toast, juices, coffee, tea, jelly buns, sausage..The eggs need tons of pepper and ketchup (you'll see - lol).Overall you could fill up and tour all day until suppertime. But you have to eat it in the restaurant level. There are signs plastered all over about it. Not complaining about not eating in my room - it's actually a very nice setup in the restaurant.

The Red Metro station is 1 block down. If you don't want to rent a car, buy a $5 pass at the station and take the subways and buses all you want (there are small $1-2 surcharges to travel to Knott's Berry Farm, Six Flags or Disneyland). Car rentals are cheap, but parking can be expensive in Hollywood if you're on a budget. Pretty easy system to figure out and it's nice and close to the hotel.

A pretty nice stay on a budget overall if you spend most of your days trucking around Hollywood - even by foot. Send me a note. I'll tell you about the rates we got and places we actually visited from this hotel.",,,,,,,,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-30,"Dear Guest,

We had a small balcony and could even see the ""HO"" of the famous sign in the distance.  On the downside, there are no shops or restaurants in walking distance from the hotel, but buses do go from the area regularly to Hollywood Blvd.  If you ask reception to get you a cab, they'll dial a private firm which seemed very expensive so we always went for a city metered cab.

Room was a $128, but turned into $162 at checkout with two sets of room taxes, a 13.10 parking fee (was quoted as $12), and a ""marketing assesement fee"" (we pay for their advertising).
They couldn't put a couple bottles of water in room, so you had to go to machine in hallway (broken). Found a grundgy little store off lobby that sold them. Breakfast was included, but more a glorifed Continenental.
You'd think a major chain would want to make a better image of itself.

malibubritt,6,,2007-06-30,BUSINESS,2007-07-24,1,Never been treated so poorly...,"I booked at this Ramada because it was the nicest hotel near my work site in the area.  My travel agent booked it for me, and the hotel wouldn't take a reservation wihout a full deposit, prepaid.  

I showed up (and after having knee surgery weeks before, so I was, pathetically, with cane and limping) and after flight delay after flight delay just wanted to check in and lie down.  I was rudely told that they had never had a reservation under my name.  I asked if I could provide the confirmation number, since my bank had already been charged the money for the deposit, and that perhaps they have my name wrong.  ""It won't matter if you have a confirmation number, ma'am, because we have no rooms left.""  Jerk.  I tried to tell them that I had already been charged, and it made no difference.  Completely rude and unforgiving.  So I called the central office from the main lobby (after being told that my car was now in the way of other guests trying to check in) and it turns out that my reservation was cancelled.  They blamed it on my travel agent, and that they would have never cancelled the reservation without telling me and tried to keep my money!

I finally escalated this through my travel agent to their central office again, at which point they admitted overbooking and randomly cancelling guests reservations with no warning or assistance to find accomodations.  I got an ""apology"" from the general manager which basically said, ""Your travel agent did not cancel the reservation, we did.""  

It then took another two weeks to get my money back.  I will NEVER stay at another Ramada ever again, and my large travel company will never book another client here.

As an AOL user, I left my computer on for hours, believing this Ramada offered free local calls, as most Ramada's do.  There was no announcement anywhere (by telephone, in hotel portfolio, or on contract at check-in) that there was a 10 cent per minute local phone charge.  The manager (Roman Baranov) could not have cared less about my situation, and actually said that I should have used the Internet the Ramada provides at a $10 per day charge instead.  He could have waived the charge ($220 for two local phone calls), but he refused.   The deceptive, hidden charges, and bad management,  make me never want to stay at another Ramada again!

On the website we looked at it stated airport shuttle, absolutely a load of crap, when we arrived at the airport I proceeded to call the hotel and was informed that they don't offer a shuttle and we would have to ride the ""Super Shuttle"" which costs $15 one way and that didn't include the ""tip.""  ( Just a personal tip for any single woman going, DON'T take the super shuttle, we were offered a ""special tour"" in our drivers mercedes for 5 hours for $100!) When we arrived at the hotel the front desk man wasn't very helpful when I asked to have extra linen sent up to the room. We were told that there was only one houseman on until 11, like this would be a huge inconvenience. When the houseman came to our room he told us that they didn't have enough extra linen to give us ( I was literally stunned, I work in housekeeping at a hotel so the mere thought of them not having enough linen for us was ridiculous) He then brought us a rollaway instead and told us not to tell because we would be charged for it. He also informed us to keep our safety bar on our sliding door secure because other guests could come to our porch and potentially get in our room. Upon looking at the state of the rollaway my friend and I decided the queen bed would have to work, and on a positive note the bed was actually one of the nicest I have ever slept on in a hotel. 

When we entered the bathroom we found an array of surprises including the previous guests glob of hair on the shower wall, mold growing in all corners of the room which seemed to house our other room mates, ants! after seeing this we walked to rite aid and I purchased some mr clean and did a serious scrub down. Other than that the room was ok, the one other note worthy comment is that they don't allow the Do Not Disturb signs to be used as a form of security and every day after 12 housekeeping would enter your room if you weren't their and service the room. 

The breakfast was okay, for being free, but I would suggest looking at the eggs before eating them. They also provide free entertainment on monday's and wednesdays which is usually a comedian. 

The only positive thing about the location is that it is about a 5 min walk to the metro-subway system which connects you right to hollywood blvd. Thats it. I made sure I had my tear gas with me any time I left.

True, there was no fresh fruit, but it does come with the room, and it saved us serious money. The room was very comfortable, and the outdoor noise was no problem, with the exception of the nightclub night, which is pretty loud. We were tired so we still fell asleep. I do agree that the neighborhood is not one to go looking for trouble in, but we walked to the subway daily and had no problems. There is also a RiteAid less than a block away, which was quite convenient.
Overall, I found this hotel much better than the reviews posted here. I stay stayed in other low-rated hotels that were so much worse. The staff was always helpful to us, the room was always clean, the pool was open and clean, and the parking fee is clearly stated online.

However, the breakfast was terrible.  The fruit came out of a can, the orange juice was from a powder and I have no idea where the eggs came from.  They had certainly never been near a chicken.

The only equipment in the gym which worked were the free weights.

The bathroom was not stocked with the standard amenities when I arrived ( shampoo, soap etc ) so I had to wait until the cleaners came in the next morning to obtain some.  Fortunately I slept in, so that wasn't a problem!

The hotel is in the middle of nowhere.  While it is 4 miles from Hollywood, that means a 25 minute drive in LA.

So, if you can get it on sale, then fine, but don't even think about paying posted rates.  There are better deals to be had in the Hollywood, West Hollywood area.

2PCxsbaggage,1,,2007-04-30,FAMILY,2007-04-15,1,Simply Awful,"My wife  and 2 young daughters  arrived around midnignt after a long drive from Las Vegas.The night clerk was pleasant and we were assigned a room on the 2nd floor which was reached via a very slow lift.
The room had an odour and the bathoom old and rusty panels were seen above the bath.
Everywhere that you looked warning and threatening signs abounded  with the appropriate penalty for each  particular offence.This was more like third world government offices  or army barracks than an hotel. The car park displayed signs about skate boarding, dogs on leash and the penalty for parking in the wrong place. The lift carried a sign ""NO SMOKING. VIOLATERS WILL BE PROSECUTED"". The bathroom displayed a notice that if any towels, pillows or bedding were to be removed what fee will be incurred for each missing item. If you needed extra bedding or towels be warned house keeping only arrive at 8.30am.
Never in 40 years of  worldwide travel have I seen such draconian and authoritarian notices in an Hotel let alone one that boasts 3 stars.
The breakfast was a joke; the juice, coffee, bread, bagels and jam of a poor quality . The eggs (square yellow pieces), sausage (looked burned or reheated) and  waffle were tastless and unappetitising. Again the theme of government offices is evident where a notice proclaimed a charge of $1 would be made if coffee was removed from the dining room.
My wife, who had not seen that among  the proliferation of notices was one that stated that all food be eaten in the  diningroom, asked the person serving the ""hot buffet""  if she could take something for her 2 daughters who were still in the room. The serving gentleman spoke poor English and referred the matter to a more senior person  whose response was absolutely unbeliveable. She pointed to the sign and asked my wife in a loud aggressive manner if she could read and that no food was to leave the dining area.
Hospitality- it is defnitely not. Should you be humiliated in the presence of other guests because of a simple request. Surely there are billions of less offensive ways to respond.
If I were able to add one more sign it would read CHEAP.
The hotel is far from Hollywood and Universal studios and OK if you have a car, but if not taxi bills will add insult to injury.
It was a truely awful experience that has been drawn to the attention of the Ramada Hotel group.

It claims to be in a super, convenient location, but the various blocks around the hotel are practically desolate or if inhabited, by no one you would like to be approached by. We booked this hotel on expedia. It cost almost 200 dollars, so you would assume it's got to be decent. we drove to the driveway of the hotel, got in and immediately we wanted to leave. The lobby was ugly (startling for a $200 a day stay). The surrounding area filled with riff raff, no place for a vacation. But we were going to put up with it. After all, it's a pain to have to move to a different hotel. But the interaction with the front desk clerk did it!!! I considered it a stroke of good luck that the clerk was so disgustingly rude. Obviously he doesn't realize he's in the service industry. He provided no service, no hospitality, only an attitude of ""don't you dare bother me."" His hair was oily, greasy. He was checking me in, in the midst of it, then interrupted it with another transaction and left me standing there. WHen i complained, he snapped. so we called expedia and immediately booked ourselves a different hotel. His rudeness was a stroke of luck in disguise. Believe me, the location alone will make you weep with depression. You can spend your two hundred dollars a night on a better place. we even payed the penalty just to get out of that hell hole.

We also booked the hotel for the gym facilities, which are terrible at the hotel, so don't stay here if you want a working gym. Everything was broken!

chigasakidaniel,5,"Chigasaki, Japan",2007-03-31,BUSINESS,2007-03-12,1,Not Funny: Avoid this One,"Stayed four nights in February. The only reason to consider this hotel is that it is about three minutes walk from the Vermont-Wishire metro stop, which was convenient for our group with suitcases. And our rate was $100 per night + taxes.

But the front desk staff was not very excited about helping with questions, and seemed overworked.

Rooms were barely OK. Fairly big, but worn (the carpet was peeling up at the bathroom line, etc).

And if you are inclinded to worry about the supernatural, we were told that the hotel basement (where the breakfast is served) used to be a morgue! The more I considered this, the more I believed it. There are no readily visible stairways from the basement, and it is very gloomy.

Then there is the free ""Comedy Night"". I was one of only three sorry audience members, apparently jet-lagged and looking for a laugh or two. But there was nothing funny about the show, which featured three quite drunk guys who had absolutely zero professionalism and were actually scary. The warm-up ""comic"" almost fell over he was so drunk, and his act consisted of swearing and trying to degrade audience members with silly comments meant to be philosophical. I almost walked out at that point, but then remembered that this was a free show and I probably should give them another chance. So the next guy told sad tale after sad tale about his sorry life. Nothing to smile at. All in all, a nightmare evening (and a beer was something like eight dollars). 

Finally, do not think that this hotel is in the Hollywood you probably have in mind. The direct area is dangerous in the evening, and dirty any time. If you want upscale West Hollywood you need to go there.",,2.0,2.0,,2.0,2.0,2.0,,,,,1

Clyde645,6,,2007-02-28,SOLO,2007-03-02,2,Extreme disappointment.  Not Glamorous.,"This hotel is a perfect example of FALSE ADVERTISING at its best.  It even has its own extremely lame website that absolutely misleads potential customers.

First and foremost, the surrounding area is an absolute dump and I did not feel safe - day or night - walking around the general vicinity of this hotel - even to get my car from the ghetto self park area in the back of the hotel.

Second - The hotel is very old and is in disrepair. Do not go to this hotel expecting to be in the glamorous surroundings of Hollywood. I had never been to Hollywood or Beverly Hills before and I was expecting a lot more from this place. Booking this hotel means you are staying in a ghetto of Los Angeles. It was sad when I checked in. I overheard other guests who were checking in as part of a wedding party. I felt bad for them because the bride & groom probably assumed that this was a nice place for their wedding party to stay. I only came to ""Hollywood"" to see the Price is Right so I wasn't banking on this hotel to impress my fellow travel companions (thank God).

The toilets barely flush. The ironing board is inadequate. The maids entered my room while I was away for a short time in the morning even though I had the ""Do not disturb"" sign on the door handle.  I don't understand this place - it is full of absolutely incompetent people. On top of all of these negative comments, I also must add that I only encountered one person that worked at this hotel that spoke fluent english. Don't go here and please, please, learn from my mistake of booking a room here.

Upon arrival the front desk asked me if I needed a shuttle back to LAX airport.  I said yes and was asked for a 10 dollar deposit.  I questioned why and was told the hotel gives the shuttle 10 dollars when we leave.  This shuttle is 15 dollars a person and the hotel never gave the shuttle any money.  I was travelling with my mother so I had to pay 40 dollars for a ride.  We were placed in a room in the front of the hotel.  This is off of Vermont which is a very busy road and not much insulation and can hear people talking, traffic and sirens all through the night.  On the second day I requested to be moved to the back of the hotel and was told that the entire hotel was booked and we would have to stay another night.  Room 210 had carpet and my mother received a rash up both her legs.  I specifically requested that our second room does not have a fridge and microave but upon arriving and no suprise we had the fridge and microave, thankfully there was no carpet.  All the advertisements state there is a heated pool, which is not heated, alarm clocks, which the alarms do not work, and the wake up call never happened.  On the second wake up call I had to request a trial to make sure this worked.  Although the breakfast is free it is the same everyday.

Traveler.X.gl,4,,2005-05-31,FRIENDS,2006-10-28,3,Several Points Worth Considering,"You get what you pay for. You hear it again and again, but this time it's truer than ever. Please pay attention to the following and you'll be fine, but remember to read all reviews with a pinch of salt. 

1) The neighbourhood is shady. This has already been covered in some reviews. Believe it. I don't see it changing in the near future. This means that in the evening you'll see sketchy individuals wandering around. The sidewalks are not glamorourized - infact, they're dirty in typical city-style. 

I stayed with a friend and I did not feel very safe with us two being girls. Walk around with someone else if you can. 

2) There isn't much to eat around here except for a fastfood Wendys across the street a block away, and the hotel breakfast itself. The hotel breakfast is average and repetitive - the standard eggs, bacon, toast, juice. 

3) The metro/subway is a short walk away. About 5 minutes of brisk walking. This takes you everywhere. I love the all-day transit rate also! $5 if I recall. 

4) I found the rooms of the hotel interesting, tolerable, and fun. If you're expecting glamour and glitz, you'll be disappointed. This serves its purpose as a room. There's an unassuming microwave in most rooms - we had one in ours that proved quite useful. 

The carpets are not spotless but this is a hotel, for crying out loud. Not your mother's kitchen. 

5) Bring conditioner for your hair, girls. The water in LA is VERY hard. 

Those are the handful of points I can remember. Our stay was in May 2005 for 10 days. We had an excellent time in LA doing all the things in hollywood and making our rounds to disneyland and the other parks. We were out of the hotel at 9am and then back at 9pm.

A short 5 minute walk to the metro station.

Cons: Shady area during the night.  Police said there are transients and prostitutes that stand in front of the hotel starting at 11pm.  Do not walk around by yourself in the evening.  

Hotel staff were not knowledgeable about surrounding area and terrible at giving directions.  Do not rely on staff giving advice.  Staff were not polite or pleasant when checking in.  They overcharged me and expected me to pay the higher rate even though I was quoted less.  I found only one staff member at the front desk helpful.

The rooms were nice, clean, and comfortable but our toilet kept clogging.
At least there was a hot breakfast included.

Overall I would not stay here again.  The negatives outweigh the positives.  I would stay at The Hollywood Orchid Suites or somewhere else closer to Hollywood.

the room was clean, the furnishings a bit above average and the beds were nice...very comfortable.  the bathroom was a bit small, but not too bad.  the staff was courteous, but i did not need any sightseeing information so i cannot speak to that.

my room was on the second floor and the nearby ice machine was broken.  not a big problem...just had to take the elevator down and use the one on the first floor in the same location.

the continental breakfast was a bit better than expected (i'm not used to much).  eggs, sausage, toast, biscuits and cereal were available, as well as the expected orange juice and coffee.  fruit was a bit lacking though...as i recall, they only offered canned peaches and cocktail salad.

although some whine about the parking charges, it is a fact of life in most hollywood hotels/motels.  it cost $12 per day, but at least the lot was gated.

the gym facilities were okay.  a couple of the machines were broken, but i was still able to get a good workout.  it was never crowded when i was there -- i had the place to myself except for one time. 

the neighborhood is kind of dicey, as one reviewer said.  however, i never had any problems.  i dined in a mexican place down the street that was decent.  there is a chain drugstore about a block from the hotel which was nice to have around.  i'm not taking any points off for location, as hollywood in general is run down and kind of tacky.  i would much rather have stayed where i did than some places near the walk of fame, etc.  because the ""real"" hollywood is usually full of bums and druggies.

the rooms have an internet option keyed to the television set that's available for $9.95 per day.  it's awful.  i used the same setup once somewhere else and it was lousy, too.  i'd pass on trying to use it unless absolutely necessary. 

overall, i'd come back.  i think i could have done a lot worse at the price i paid (booked through aaa).  my star rating is based on the quality of my stay and price comparisons within the area.  the four stars are not intended in an absolute sense.  i think aaa rated the place as three diamonds, which seemed about right.

OzzyTravellers,1,,2006-09-30,COUPLES,2006-10-10,3,"Good location, ok room, average buffet and terrible surrounding area","My wife and i stayed at the Ramada Inn for 5 days in late September 2006 because we wanted a good location for easy access to Disneyland and Universal Studios. The surrounding area was a nightmare due to three main factors: 1) no closeby restaurants that were clean, 2) the poverty surrounding the hotel and 3) loud car noises from races and burnouts. Although the physical location was very good- everything else was ok to worrying. The breakfast was very very average- cutlery was grubby too, the service was slow and parking very expensive ($12US per day) including any tours/activities they offered us. We needed to do everything from booking Disneyland, Universal and LA Tours on our own to ensure we got it at a reasonable price. Good price and distance from attractions- but thats about it. Think twice.

MaxReheat,15,"Middlesbrough, United Kingdom",2006-09-30,COUPLES,2006-10-07,4,Can't see why people complain,"This hotel was easy to find just off N. Vermont and Lexington. There was plenty of parking, $12 a day isn't too bad considering the cheap room rates. Inside the hotel istelf was smart and check in was quick and easy. The receptionist seemed a bit dumb when we asked questions about the area but not rude or anything. The room itself was massive, clean and smart, not the biggest bathroom but it had everything you need in it. The rooms had a shared balcony overlooking a pleasant courtyard area. The window locks looked a bit flimsy but didn't overly worry us. Beds were big, comfy and well presented and room well equipped with tv, fridge, microwave, ironing board. We stayed in the MGM Grand just after this and ended up disappointed with it.
The location of the hotel could be described as dodgy depending on which way you turned outside the front door, go North up Vermont and its ok, South looks like you're heading into little Mexico. Its about a 2.5 hour walk to Rodeo Drive and Beverly Hills, less to Hollywood Boulevard, we know because we did it covering a 13 mile round trip in about 6 hours. Take a Metro bus for $3 a day, I wish we did. There are some nice little restaurants about 10 mins walk up the road particularly Palermo's.
Breakfast in the hotel isn't bad for a freebie with a selection of cereals, fruits, croissants, egg and sausages, there is a bar downstairs which has a 'comedy' act on most evenings. The house comedian should be sacked immediately, he isn't funny at all and ruins all the other acts by trying to join in. Drinks at the bar are a little expensive, $5 for a bottle of Bud and thats the cheapest they have but its not a bad placde to unwind.
The only downside to the hotel which we actually found quite amusing is that I had to assist the security guard to throw out a gay druggie who'd wandered in off the street convinced someone was trying to kill him! He went onto the next hotel and caused the same commotion in there.
I would recommend staying here to anyone, just put your walking boots on or get a bus pass.

mothnm,53,,2006-10-31,BUSINESS,2006-10-03,2,The hotel is really trying to spruce itself up.,"Driving north on Vermont from 101 the neighborhood looks seedy. Driving north on Vermont from the hotel to Griffith Park the neighborhood looks swank.

Stayed with free stay certificates but still had to pay $49 taxes for two nights. Taxed on nothing. Sigh.

Anyway, the rooms are newly painted as you will smell as soon as you enter. Due to the fumes we slept with the balcony door open and boobytrapped. The people in the room next door did the same.

The beds are comfortable and beautifully dressed. The closet was a contrived slit in the wall that held the ironing board and iron comfortably. Hey, it's an old hotel.  The bathroom had a tub with adjustable showerhead and good water pressure. Everything was clean.

The breakfast room is large and nicely decorated. Croissant selection was the most novel aspect of the breakfast.

Plumbing was shut down for two hours due to a broken pipe. Our smoke alarm kept beeping. Maintenance removed the battery causing a 10 second shreek. All night long we heard someone in another room try to silence their smoke alarm. If he had only endured the 10 seconds the ordeal would have been over.

A mauve sun visor with a gold embossed Hollywood Hotel logo was in the bathroom. Not sure it was a freebie so we didn't take it.

The rooms are OLD and TIRED as are the beds as well. The bathrooms are too small and I wouldn't walk on the carpet in my bare feet as it is disgusting. Also, I was concerned about how secure the hotel is because anyone off the streel could jump to the balcony at my room. This hotel also has a club in the basement and has loud music playing late. I personally witnessed a pimp and a lady of the night trying to solicit business in the parking lot, a parking lot that they charge $10 a day for (not worth it). There is a free breakfast, but it is very average. The only thing good about this hotel is it in close proximity to the 101 highway.

Seems like they're ALWAYS finding new ways to screw things up.  I booked this hotel through Hotwire and cringed when I saw it was a Ramada.  I just KNEW that something would go wrong.  And as usual Ramada found a new way to disappoint.  Our flight was delayed getting us to our room around 11 pm instead of 11 am as planned. We were told that the hotel was overbooked so we'd have to fend for ourselves and find another hotel room on Fri nite in LA. good luck to us after 22 hours with no sleep. Our room was PREPAID!! But that didn't matter because they resold it anyways! I guess if we couldn't/didn't show they'd be getting double paid for rooms that were not even there. Unbelievable! The next day as we checked in I explained all of the above to the manager and asked him for some LITTLE form of compensation (like the airline did the day before) for their complete disregard for our plight the nite before such as a room upgrade to make up and we'd be happy once again. He seemed to agree but then proceeded to assign us our standard room. There is just something about Ramada's culture that is down right offensive. I hope to NEVER have to stay at a Ramada EVER again.
Hotwire might also be losing some business if this type of treatment continues.

On our second night our key wouldn't work, had to get new room keys issued. Asked front desk for the best directions to a TV show taping. It was a good thing I mapped it out on mapquest before hand, or we wouldve went way out of our way. We were given the incorrect directions. If you are doing any sight seeing outside of hollywood, best to map your own directions just to be safe.  Also, ask for a room away from the busy street, or you will hear sirens all night as well as traffic/people talking. Not very sound resistant to the outside. Breakfast was decent. A good point is the subway station is a very short walk. Overall our experience here was so-so. I think if there's a next time we will pay a little extra & stay somewhere else.

It was nice that we had a microwave and small fridge.  Most hotels don't offer that for a regular room.  And there was a small balcony that was connected to two other rooms, which was nice when we needed to step out for fresh air.  Other than the size of the room being too cramped, the bed was comfy and the bathroom was clean.

Journey33331,3,,2006-06-30,NONE,2006-06-23,4,Very Nice and Affordable,"I must say I'm glad i stayed at this hotel.  I was just reading the reviews on here and i'm glad I listened to the good ones. 
This hotel had just recently been renovated and is very very nice.  The lobby and our room as wel as the restaurant were all in excellent condition. The parking is $12/day in a gated and guarded lot.  I had to smoke outside because my room was non-smoking since i had children with me.  I felt comfortable smoking outside by myself at 1:00 a.m. and I am a female.  Now I do not know much about L.A. but it did not seem dangerous in the slightest.  I had a 2 queen beds room.  It was very spacious with nice furnishings.  The bathroom was large.  The pool was very nice and heated.  It is outdoors inthe corner of the parking lot but there is a 6 foot concrete wall around it.  you don't feel like your in the parking lot and no one outside can see in the pool area.  There is a nice outdoor courtyard in the center of the hotel and a nice sauna.  The breakfast in the morning was more than nice.  Several beverage choices and hot & cold foods.  
However the staff was not very helpful with directions to attractions or anything about where to go in the area.  The staff was not very friendly or helpful with anything.  The maid yelled at me in the morning cause i asked her to come back in an hour when we would be gone out for the day.  The front desk staff was very short and uninterested.  The breakfast staff was halfway okay, they were efficient so i really didn't ask them for anything though.
Overall I give this hotel an A- due to the bad staff.

Seems to be having a facelift and is looking good so far - our  room was freshly painted and the bathroom was new.  We had a fridge and microwave too -  handy for purchases made at the Farmers Market.   Close to the Metro with several people offering assistance with ticketing and directions,  although we did use taxis at night.  Caught train to Universal Studios and upgraded to A list front of line ticket so no waiting in queues - still cheaper than taking a tour and meant we saw everything.  LA was hot during the day and cold at night so be prepared.  
The staff very friendly and helpful.   We would definitely stay there again as excellent value.  Also there is a good budget Chinese Restaurant across the road.

Had airlines not been available, having had such a splendid stay here, my wife and I would have gladly walked the distance to have been here. I was having such a euphoric time gazing at the bikini clad babes around the champagne sparkling pool, I missed my tour bus. Later that evening, my wife was dazzled at the 1160 bar with Hollywood hunks half my age paying her so much attention and as a result, for the first time ever in our 20+ years of marriage, my wife recommended we probably should start taking separate vacations! .  There are two types of people in this ""city of angels"" and streets of dreams: 1. stars and 2. those who are about to become stars. My wife and I both agreed while staying at this fabulous Hollywood Hotel, we had not been pampered as grandly and as conscienciously: since we were babes in diapers. Why one would have thought we were king and queen visting or holding court at our very own palace. On the brochure of this indescribably opulent Hollywood epicentre is stated the words, ""Where all the Action Begins."" From the moment we checked-in,   the action DID BEGIN, and continued and continued until we were chauffered away to the airport.  A great value? Money was never a consideration. How can you place a value on literally a time of your life!

LightPacker33015,5,,2006-05-31,NONE,2006-05-29,3,Convenient location,"Overall, customer service was good, although, they do not know much about the public transportation system.

Positives:
Our room came with ~24 inch TV, which was really nice. Also, it came with a microwave, which is also very convenient. It has a pool - too bad it is unheated and located outside by the parking lot. Last, it is located relatively close to a Metro station (about 1 ½ blocks) and a Rite Aid.

Negatives:
There were some faults with the room. 
One, the refrigerator in our room doesn’t work. It stayed at the same temperature, which was at room temperature, no matter how cold we set it. The room would be cooler than the fridge. Our box of ice cream turned into strawberry milk. 
Two, our shower did not work correctly; it was either scalding hot or ice cold. The screw that attached the handle to the plumbing was loose and only offers one temperature depending how you turn the handle. 
Three, their continental breakfast was lacking in so many ways. There is a reason why it is complementary.
Four, the hotel is located in a not so great neighborhood. I felt great need to dash from the Metro station, especially when it gets dark out. Also, there are constant homeless people and/or drunks to dodge.

All in all, there’s always room for improvement. If you don’t mind living in a not so great neighborhood and/or want to live close to their Metro system, you might want to consider this place.

Dreamer28397,1,,2006-05-31,NONE,2006-05-27,3,"At the end of the day, it's pretty good!","I stayed at the Ramada Hollywood near Universal studios' for 6 nights in the month of May. Me and 3 other friends shared a double room. And even though, we were sorta nervous (after reading the reviews online) We went ahead and kept our reservation. Well first of all, this hotel really isn't that bad. I think a lot of the reviews are a bit on the dramtic side. 

1) The location: Yes, this hotel is located in Hollywood. However it is NOT in the ""glam"" end of it. I wouldn't call the neighborhood ""scary"" at all. It's just a hispanic neighborhood, but we had no problems and ventured out often. The metro line and busses are about 1 block away.The hotel is pretty close to a lot of touristy spots, and there are city tours daily from the hotel. I would advise buying a map before heading out. 

2) The building: Although the outside of the hotel isn't attractive-at all. The interior isn't too bad, I found the place pretty clean and some of it looked a lil more ""modernized"". The room we shared wasn't a bad size, we had a balcony, fridge and small sofa. The bathroom was a decent size and the shower was huge. The hotel has an outdoor pool, it is in-ground, it's not the biggest pool, but it was refreshing, and has lots of loungers and plants around it.

3) Continental breakfast: Every morning there was a free breakfast. We all found it decent, they serve cereals, fruit (like fruit cocktails), toast, bagels, croissants, eggs (meh) sausages (yummy!) and waffles (also good). The eating area is pretty nice and it's well maintaned and clean.

4) Customer service: This is the only issue, I had with this hotel. We did have one bad expirence. On Monday nights, the hotel bar has a ""comedy show"" Well I did find the show a little amatureish, but for the most part it was great...That is until they had one comic come on. He was the most vulgar, rude performer I have ever seen. He not only made disgusting jokes about incest, rape and drug use. But he ""picked"" out people in the audience and made extremelely rude comments and jokes at their expense, and on top of all that, all he did was yell. We did end up walking out. When we brought this issue up to the front desk, they simply stated ""That's how comedy is here"" And to this I replied ""You guys find incest, rape and drug use funny?"" The older gentlemen at the counter didn't take us very seriously and shrugged us off. Also, when it comes to calling cabs, make sure to tell the front desk to call you a 'Yellow cab' the ""Hotel cab"" they use there charges you more than double than all other cab companies. We also, found the front desk staff rude and always quick to get rid of you. They don't seem to know a lot of basic questions/directions. When we asked them where malls, grocery stores, good bars in the area were...they look confused and just sorta mumble an answer. 

This is a very honest review. If you are looking for a basic hotel in a pretty central area, with moderate prices, than definatley book here. It's great for the price!!! And served all our needs, I would definatley stay here again.

Exploration27840,1,,2006-05-31,NONE,2006-05-22,2,Not tooooo bad but has problems,"We arrived at LAX and cabbed it to the Ramada where we stayed for six nights. Hotel itself is in good shape and surpisingly clean from what we had read in past reviews. 

Our room was descent in size, stocked accordingly and the fridge within the room was greatly useful! Area is not great but coming from Halifax,NS, a small province in Canada, we were in no way scared to be there, I just wouldnt go walking around by myself, at night. It is close to both the subway and bus stops (for future tourists....subway fares are based on the honour system as we later found out so we started paying then stopped since noone was there...on our second last day, we realized how it worked and you can be fined if pass is not on your person....but like I said previously, from what I saw, noone paid...its weird for a large city!)

Staff were not overly friendly, and getting any information from them was like pulling teeth and seemed un-interested in helping whatsoever....my one big issue to warn future tourists about with this hotel is to NOT use their ""called taxis"" as they have their ""own"" rates and its ridiculous....we decided to cab it to dennys one morning for a change of scenery from the free bfst(which isnt bad), we got in and asked since the ""cab' had NO signage, no driver ID's, meter for fares or anything! A little awkward and the driver told us it would about $20+ !!!....We said no way, got out, called a regular cab(since we thought thats what the hotel was sending) and it was $6.40 !!! BIG BIG difference, we complained to the hotel saying it is unfair to rip off tourists who dont know the fare differences and they had no reply....Just keep an eye out and be careful of your funds.

We went to the club 1160 bar(within the hotel) one night before we went out that night for the comedy club. Wasnt bad!....at first....last, head show was by a guy named ""lucky louie"" who apparently has a HBO show coming out soon-----A PIG!!!! He yelled from the start, cursed, talked about molestation of children COUNTLESS times, his gay lifestyle and how it felt and how he didnt like it, cursed at everyone, talked about my breasts, my friends, asked if a newcomer girl who walked in shaved it, harassed her until she left then harassed the remaining gentlemen who had been with the girl for a good 20min. He asked him to stop and that further egged him on--the guy was humiliated.....we finally left, it was shocking!!!! When mentioned the activities to the front desk and how the ""comedian"" said ""who --- cares, there's no --- management here to tell me what to do"", they laughed it off and said nothing. If many hotel guests are leaving due to the nonsense of a show, the comdian should be asked to leave, its inappropriate....

All in all, I would probably return to the hotel...its close to transportation, and as long as you keep to yourself, you'll be fine with the staff and surroundings. As for the hotel bar, we had a bad experience, I think it just depends on the activity that is going on. If you want a spotless hotel with fantastic, helpful staff, this isnt for you. If you're okay with a clean hotel, good bfst, and close to transportation and okay with fending for yourself as we were, I think you'll be okay! Good luck and enjoy LA! I highly recommend Universal Studios!! As a side note and for help, their shuttle to Universal is $30! If you walk just over one block to the subway, hop on, take it to ""universal city"", it takes like 10minutes and your're at the front of the pasrk where there is a universal shuttle(free) waiting at the bottom, just across the street from the subway! Save some $!

ukrishnan,1,,2006-05-31,BUSINESS,2006-05-17,4,Its actually decent,"I wasnt going to write a review but then seeing what people wrote here i thought i wud put in my 2c worth. I was in LA to attend a conference between april 26 and may 1. 
I booked the hotel through orbitz, and then started reading the reviews here which were not all that charitable.so i must confess that i had second thoughts about the place,which is why i am writing now to give you my honest opinion. 
The location of the hotel is in a poorer part of west hollywood. Its just a hispanic neighborhood. It is not threatening by any means, just not as classy as you probably have been used to. It is about 2 blocks away from the LA metro system,which is just like the DC metro system. The only drawback is that the metro doesnt take you to too many places. it basically runs between downtown and hollywood. so if you are going to check out downtown or hollywood, the metro is just fine and you dont need a car. for all other places you are better off driving. 
The rooms are small, but decent. We got a room facing the road so i must admit that at night if you are a light sleeper, you can be woken up by the sounds of passing trucks or buses. The rooms are clean. 
The hotel has a complimentary breakfast- standard waffles, croissants, cereal, sausages and eggs. Its the same breakfast everyday. But hey, its Free. 
This hotel i think is a misfit in the neighborhood- it was known as the hollywood hotel earlier- i think the ramada must have bought it now or something. Anyways there are big boardrooms and the facilties for a restaurant- maybe they just closed it because they didnt have enough business.
There are no good restaurants within walking distance. There is one Thai place about a block away- which has decent food, and they do deliver to the hotel. 
We flew from DC to LAX and rented a car to the hotel, which has plenty of parking, but at a rate of 12 bucks a night. 
So on the whole, this is a decent hotel. Its by no means a really memorable or romantic one, but if you can get it for about 70 bucks a night and you are on a budget, then its OK enough.

Neighborhood is on the dodgy side, I wouldn't feel too safe walking around there at night.  Hotel is close to the subway and close to the bus system, but those are the only things it's near.  Nothing else is within walking distance.  I forgot to pack a comb and asked the front desk staff if there might be a comb there.  The gentleman behind the counter asked if it could be used and if it was okay if it had dandruff in it.  He directed me to a 7-11 that was 5 blocks away.  Continental breakfast was awful, with soggy croissants and signs all over saying that nothing could be taken up to the rooms.  I booked this on hotwire, which claimed this was a 3 star hotel.  I'd give it 2 stars, and that's being kind.

The lobby is the only nice thing about this Motel. We received a ""deluxe room"". As we were walking to our room- we could actually hear the people in their rooms as we passed by- talking, singing, laughing, music. Once in our room- there were cracks in the walls, holes in the love seat fabric, cigarette burns, holes, and stains in the carpets, mold in the shower tiles, holes in the blue blankets on the bed, peeling wall paper, the bed mattress was sunk in the middle, all the furniture was cracked and chipped and the desk had not been dusted in many, many days. This was just at first glance and the things I took photos of before we backed out of the room and walked back to our car and drove away. Far Far Away. This motel is near Universal- about 6  101 highway exits away. However- Vermont St. is in the very very outskirts of Hollywood and should be listed as an LA hotel. The area is very seedy and I would not recommend walking the neighborhood at night. As we drove away from the Ramada and to a Hyatt- you can't believe the great relief we had that we would not be staying at the Ramada.

If you are tight on budget and don't mind the above things- then this Motel might be for you. If you have children and care about them- then please please- go stay in Anaheim. Do not bring them to this Motel.

When we opened the door of a ""non-smoking room"" it smelled like a giant ash tray. I do have to say that they changed our room without any problems. Second, the beds/pillows/linens are horrid. I slept less than 6 hours in 2 nights. The mattresses are rock hard, the pillows were not plush, and the their was a curly dark hair in my blankets. (Clearly not mine since I'm blonde). The free breakfast was okay, the only real perk of the hotel. Oh and they should really mention the fact that you have to pay for parking (12 bucks/night). 
The staff were not very friendly as well. We asked for directions one night, and the desk clerk seemed very annoyed, and placed a brochure in front of us--without saying a  word. (This brochure actually ended up getting us lost--the directions were horrid).
I would only recommend this hotel for those trying to save a buck. Next time, I'd pay the extra money for a nicer hotel. The pictures on the internet are very unrealistic!

Motel was in horrible location, rooms were in much need of repair, dirty, stained bedding, carpets were filthy, bathroom was worse. One look and we gave the keys back, canceled our two nights stay and left!!  

When we were pulling out of the parking lot, police officers had a group of 5-6 men, hands above their heads leaned up against the side of the motel.  Definetly a scary area of Hollywood.

It's only a three-stop Metro ride to Hollywood/Highlands (Mann's Chinese Theater, etc.), which is excellent.

The room was clean and had all the amenities you need in a hotel - hairdryer, toiletries, etc.  I would recommend requesting a second or third-floor room, as there's a nightclub on the ground floor that is a bit loud.  However, if you put the fan on at night, you can't hear anything.

The continental breakfast is not bad - nothing to write home about, but you can get a pretty basic meal to start your day.  The variety was actually more than I expected.

If you're looking for a hotel on a budget that gives you the freedom to see LA, this is a good bet.  Take the normal precautions you would when traveling to any large city and you'll be fine.

It was very easy to get to the major highways and there's a Metro station about a minute away.  We were worried about the ""noisy nightclub"" that we'd read about in other TripAdvisor reviews of this hotel, but we slept soundly and noise-free every night.

Klare B,1,,2005-10-31,NONE,2005-11-21,4,"Nice clean hotel, close enough to sights","We arrived at LAX and got the free shuttle bus to the green metro line - what an experience! - scary at first as two 20-something english ladies with huge suitcases stuck out like a sore thumb attracting a lot of attention but we found the people were really nice! 

We found the Ramada easily - 2 minutes walk up from the Santa Monica metro stop (and about 4 minutes down from the perhaps less scary looking Sunset Boulevard stop) and first impressions thought it was a bad area, we were allocated a room on the 2nd floor overlooking a little courtyard.  The room was clean, very comfortable bed with fridge and microwave and good shower.  3 star is about right for this hotel, although we've stayed in many 4 stars in england that are about of this standard and the 4 star in san diego we stayed in was worse than this. The hotel breakfast was good, with plenty of choice.  The receptionists well helpful and friendly also.

We ventured out at night on the metro to Hollywood Boulevard to see the sights, only 3 or 4 stops away and it was fine, a few homeless people about but I'd say the area around the hotel is more of a poor area than a rough one, and people seemed to keep themselves to themselves. 

The metro doesn't stretch to West Hollywood/Beverley Hills or Santa Monica and the coast so for the next 4 nights caught the number 4 bus or the 304 bus ($2.25 all day pass for all of LA metro AND bus) which runs along Santa Monica boulevard and to West Hollywood where we found a great restaurant called the Spanish Kitchen and many great gay bars.   

The bus, like the metro, seemed scary at first but it was fine. The locals do tend to look you up and down a bit but I only think its because they don't get a lot of nice looking well dressed ladies on the bus after dark!

We also caught the bus to Santa Monica although with the awful traffic jams it did take over an hour.

You don't NEED a car in LA, we managed quite well with the bus and train, managing to get to Universal Studios in 10 minutes by metro, Hollywood Boulevard in less than 10 minutes and West Hollywood bars and restaurants in 25-30 minutes.

We even caught the Amtrak train to San Diego from Union Station for $25 each and it took about 2 and a half hours.

Overall an excellent stay in LA and I would recommend the hotel for people on a budget or travelling around the States.

We loved LA and Hollywood, we would definitely go again though would probably stay at the Ramada West Hollywood as this was more central for what we wanted to do.

I did find the staff to be a little on the straightforward side.  NOT overly friendly but professional.

Our room was immaculately clean but even with the DND sign on the door, the maid came in and cleaned anyhow.

For a hotel chain that is supposed to offer Complimentary wireless internet and oops bag (forgotton bathroom amenities), they lacked.  I did get my high speed internet but it came with a price tag and No oops bag (Doesn't that dock QA points).

Although the neighborhood isn't the best, we didn't feel unsafe and even made use of the Metro (Subway) to spend the day at Universal Studios (beats the parking cost)and walked home in the late night after an evening at Universal City Walk.

Their complimentary continental breakfast was probably the best I have had in my travels.  Good Job!

However, if you are looking for a clean hotel that is accessible to many of the Hollywood/Los Angeles sites and doesn't cost a fortune then this may be a good choice.   It is not fancy, but as I mentioned it is clean and parking is safe (and cheap ($9/day, for Los Angeles!)).  The noisy nightclub mentioned in the other posts was not an issue for us even though we stayed on the first level.   The breakfast ----, but once again you get what you pay for!

Suzanne55,15,,2005-08-31,NONE,2005-08-29,2,"Poor service, decent room, not-so-great location","My Complaint:
I booked two rooms at this hotel via Hotwire over a month before our trip ($108 per room, including taxes & fees). My husband and I were traveling with another couple and only planned to stay one night in Hollywood before heading south for a wedding. Our plane from Honolulu arrived at LAX about 6pm and we drove around the area exploring for awhile before checking into the hotel at 8pm. The front desk clerk informed me that he only showed a reservation for one room (and didn’t care at all that I had a print-out of my confirmation with Hotwire showing two PREPAID rooms). He said they were sold out for the evening and the four of us could share one room or we could try the Travelodge down the street. He also said he didn’t see our reservation as being prepaid. No manager on duty to assist us.

We ended up sharing the one room and I called Hotwire to refund the cost of the other (no problems on that side). In the morning the front desk clerk (the same guy – they sure do work long hours!) confirmed that our room was already paid and said another room had opened up later that night, but he didn’t want to disturb us since it was late. Um, okay. Thanks for letting me know after the fact. He tried to charge us for the parking ($9 I think) and I told him there was no way I was paying for that when they gave away one of our rooms – the LEAST they could do was comp it. He said he didn’t have the authority. It wasn’t until after I asked to speak to the manager he finally got up and went to ask for authorization to comp. 

Other Details:
Our first floor room was fine. Not a bad size - two double beds, small couch and coffee table, mini fridge and microwave. Clean. Fairly quiet. View of parking lot.

Elevator down to breakfast area was unbearably slow (5 minutes both ways, seriously). They need a set of stairs nearby or something. 

Breakfast wasn’t great, but it was free so I can’t really complain. When we were there they were out of forks, juice glasses, and syrup. Eggs and croissants were gross, but there was plenty of juice, milk, cereal, toast, waffles, and sausages that were fine.

Area was somewhat seedy, but if you’re driving it’s fine. Don’t expect to walk to Hollywood or any other sites of interest – it’s quite a ways and not a pretty walk. 

Parking was being renovated or something nearest to the hotel, so it was hard to find a stall. When we returned from sightseeing at around 11:30pm we got the last stall and it was >tight<!

We didn’t see the pool area, but the courtyard area in the center of the hotel looked nice.

Is this a 2 or 3 star hotel?? Hotwire calls it 3, but Tripadvisor says 2. I’d definitely call it a 2. Don’t pay more than $90 to stay here.

LightPacker12268,1,,2005-06-30,BUSINESS,2005-06-27,1,Awful.  Hated this hotel.,"First of all, its a stretch to call this Hollywood.  This is a VERY funky part of the west part of downtown.  You can get better deals just looking for a hotel downtown.  I woud not walk to this Metro station.

Its not a 3 star hotel - -its a converted motor court.  It has no on-site restaurant and you should NOT venture out at night.  It has a breakfast that you should really skip - little squares of powdered eggs with toast is not breakfast.  The coffee tasted like it was filtered through nicotine.  But maybe thats because the stench of nicotine covered me in my ""non-smoking"" room.  The sheets and pillows were saturated with cigarette smell.  Perhaps the most delightful feature was the flickering blue flourescent light found outside your barred window at night that was reminiscent of a flophouse.  It was horrid.  Parking here is about $10 a night. 

I couldn't wait to leave.  I danced a jig.

oandl2005,31,,2005-06-30,NONE,2005-06-24,3,Wow LA is huge!!!,"We stayed here on the last 2 nights of our holiday around the west and had a pleasant experience.  The staff were very friendly and helpful, the hotel was modern and clean. Breakfast was good and had plenty of choice. Dissappointed that the pool was closed but we did not get time to use it anyway.  The hotel was easy to find despite Vermont Avenue being about 20 miles long!  By looking at the map we thought we could walk to places of interest but upon arrival we realised this would be impossible.  We did not leave the hotel except by car or on a tour bus although the area looked quite safe.  Universal Studios and Hollywood are about 10 minutes in the car so location is good.  The tour buses are a bit over priced for what they are but they save you having to drive and look at the sights at the same time.  Hollywood was not what we expected and we are not in much hurry to rush back.

Getaway4993,2,,2005-06-30,NONE,2005-06-22,1,Terrible,"After staying in Vegas and Anaheim we were looking forward to Los Angeles.
When we arrived the hotel receptionist was in a full blown arguement with a guest...what ever happened to the customer always being right.
The room on first impressions was ok. But after three days of the toilet not flushing and the TV working when it wanted, it got a bit annoying.
These defects were reported every morning, but the toilet only ever flushed twice until not working again until the next morning.
Unfortunately we had two young children, who were asleep very soon after returning from a day out, and the option of getting a plumber in to fix the toilet in the evenings was impractical as it would of woke our children.
On asking the reception staff for directions or advice on were to go, it was very obvious that they had better things to do, unless you payed them for one of there trips.
As for leaving the hotel room at night....forget it. This truely is not a tourist area and I live in Glasgow.
I would recommend this hotel to NOBODY in fact I would not recommend Los Angeles to anyone either. The only nice part of Los Angeles is Universal, Six Flags and going home. We will never visit again.",,1.0,1.0,,,2.0,3.0,Gisel M,Front Office Manager,2018-11-01,"Dear Guest...

modge,25,,2004-07-31,NONE,2005-06-07,4,Good Value for Money,"I stayed here a few months ago for ten nights and found it to be an entirely satisfactory hotel.  

We had a ground floor, courtyard facing room, and experienced no noise disturbance at all during our stay.  The room was a good size and the bathroom was huge.  Both were clean, and we were given lots of fresh towels each day.  The only problem we had with the room was when the TV stopped working, but after calling reception a porter arrived within 5 minutes and had fixed the problem.

The fitness room was an added extra that we hadn't expected, and although basic it was perfectly adequate for a vacation workout.  The pool area was a real bonus, despite being next to the car park, it was very peaceful and well laid out, and well serviced by hotel staff.  There was also a small store, laundry and sauna that we didn't make use of.  The only real problem with the ammenities was that they have only one internet terminal that was very popular and slightly expensive to use. 

All of the staff were very friendly and happy to help with making bookings and giving directions.  Being near to two Metro stations was the real reason we selected the hotel as we had no car and it proved to be a real success.  The area is not wonderful but neither is it worryingly rough.  There tended to be homeless people near the large hospital up the street but we experienced no problems walking by, even at nght.

This hotel is standard, nothing special, but perfectly clean, friendly and well equipped. It was ideal for our longer stay being relatively cheap, close to public transport and having the pool facilities.",,4.0,3.0,,,4.0,3.0,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-30,"Dear Guest,

Pagora,4,,,,2005-05-19,3,This is not the stuff dreams are made off,"First visit to LA. November 2004 Hotel is in good locatin, 4 blocks from Metro. Vermont/Sunset. On same line as Hollywood Blvd and Universal Studios. Booked with Expedia requesting smoking room - hotel non smoking. Room large, cleaned every day as was bathroom. Coffee facilities & TV. Request room on 2nd floor due to noise form disco Thurs - Sun, can still hear it, but just. Complimentary breakie is quite good, saving on mid day meal. Reception staff not friendly but all others are. Didn't try restaurant as lots of places to eat on Sunset Blvd, 5 min walk.
Hotel was best thing about this experience. Would recommend it if you are on a budget. LA has street people every where in centre. Got of at couple stations to explore and got straight back on. Be very careful if using the Greyhound Terminal until you are inside.
For a lone female traveller did not feel safe except close to hotel, even in the day time. Booked 5 days, 2 to see Hollywood area would be enough. The rest of the city is squalid except for Bel Air area and thats just a tour of the stars houses where all you see are gates and drives.
Maybe you want the 'Hollywood Experience' but this traveller would not go back . Terrible, disappointing experience.",,,,,,,,,,,,9

The room was what we expected, nothing special, but it was clean, serviceable, and perfect for our needs, as we only intended to sleep and shower there. It would be nice if guests could better regulate the HVAC system, but it wasn't a huge inconvenience.  The room showed signs of having been recently painted/wallpapered, and the bathroom was clean, and there were always extra towels.

Our second day we arrived back to find a new microwave and refrigerator in our room!  The desk clerk informed us they were putting them in every room.  We had a nice view of the very clean courtyard - in fact, the whole place was very clean.  The swimming pool was being rebuilt while we were there, but it was too cold to swim anyway.

The continental breakfast is very basic, nothing special, but the food was fine, if not varied.

Extraordinary22335,1,,2005-02-28,BUSINESS,2005-04-18,4,A Really Nice Surprise!!!!!!!!!!,"I must start by saying that a four point review, such as this, means ""Above average"".  Anyway, that being said; this hotel was surprisingly lovely!!  I only say ""surprisingly"" because after we booked the hotel, I was still looking around, and found some really bad reviews of this Hotel.  Nevertheless, we were attending the GRAMMY'S and time was running out.  

We stayed there from the 10th of Feb thru the 15th, and the accommodations,especially for the price, were just fantastic!  We had a mini-fridge and microwave, and may I add, a very nice clean room.  The hotel staff were all very pleasant as well.

After reading some reviews, I was a bit scared.  Thankfully, it was more of a dream stay, than a nightmare!

BOTTOM LINE: If you are going to a hotel in C.A., (which is literally next to just about every tourist attraction in Hollywood and L.A.), to just stay in the room, please pick another hotel.  However, if you're looking for a great hotel at an awesome price, this is the one!

If anyone's interested;  Sad to say, no GRAMMY""S were won, but, we did win at the Ramada Inn-Hollywoood!!!

Hope this review helps!

Fearless25387,1,,2005-04-30,NONE,2005-04-16,4,Very reasonable,"I was a bit nervous about staying at this hotel due to the bad reviews on here, but I was pleasently surprised. I will agree that it's not the nicest neighbourhood for a hotel to be situated in, but in no way is it dangerous. Me and my friend walked every night to the Wendy's, which is only a five minute walk away, and the only thing we encountered was alot of homeless people asking for change.

We found the staff to be very helpful, even sometimes going out of there way to help. Just before our trip to Six Flags, a woman behind reception spent the best part of 30 minutes trying to find ways to save us money on the admission fee, and she did. She went onto Six Flags' website and found out about an offer Burger King were running which saved us around $30 on the entrance fee.

The hotel is in a great location, near to Universal Studios, Hollywood Boulevard and the Staples Center. As I mentioned before there is a Wendy's restaurent a five minute walk away and also a Rite Aid for picking up snacks and drinks for your room.

The only slight problem we had was our keycards decided not to work, and we had to have reception re-encode almost daily.

Apart from that small problem, we had a great time and I'd recommend it to most people.

So, he sent us to another place, a Best Western Hotel, where we had to pay another 150$ plus taxi and breakfast. 

The next day, we went back to the Ramada where finally we could have a room for the rest of the stay. But the guy in charge, the front desk ""manager"" was unfair and rude, he said that he would for sure compensate for nothing.

Safari38212,1,,,,2005-02-13,4,~Fabulous Hotel for the price!,"I just spend a week at this hotel (Feb 6-12th) and couldnt have been more satisfied for what i paid. The hotel is VERY clean, you get free parking, free breakfast and despite the other reviews the staff was very helpful with directions and anything we needed. The subway is right across the street and it only a 10min ride to Universal Studios. It is not in the worst ""ghetto"" but in a non-tourist part of the city and in no way did i feel threatened walking around late at night. The decoration of the hotel is tasteful and up to date. My only complaint was that another guest kept creeping me out and harassing me which in no way was the hotels fault. 

The people that think it is soo horible are obviously spoiled people that only expect the best and expect that no matter how much they pay. Stay here, you will enjoy it.

lilfish5626,38,,,,2005-02-10,4,Loved this hotel again and again!,"My husband and I recently stayed at the Ramada Inn on a recent trip to California. This was our second stay at the hotel and once again, we loved it! The staff were  friendly and helpful, the rooms were large and very clean. The lobby and hotel are tastefully decorated. The continental breakfast was fabulous as well!! The room we got overlooked the nice courtyard.
    Unlike other reviewers, we LOVED the neighbourhood! This is the only area in LA that we would stay as we were a couple of blocks away from the trendy Los Feliz area of Hollywood, which has lots of great shopping and dining locales. We even saw a few celebrities in the area!! If you keep driving up N. Vermont Avenue, (where you pass lots of beautiful homes) you will find yourself in Griffith Park and further up into the Hills, Griffith Observatory (which was in  the movie""Rebel Without a Cause"") and there is a fantastic view of the Hollywood sign and the city. The Ramada is also in a good location to be able to see the other popular attractions of Hollywood, but not be right smack in the middle of it.
    We strongly disagree that it is in a ""ghetto"" neighbourhood. A few buildings around the hotel are vacant, and it is in a more residential area- thus, perhaps the negative analogy, but as you walk up the street, it begins to bustle into a great little village. 
    
    We will definately stay at the Ramada Inn for a 3rd visit the next time we are on vacation!

BertramSkogland,1,"Salmon Arm, Canada",2003-02-28,NONE,2005-02-02,4,Honest Review from Average Girl,"I stayed at this hotel in Feb of 2003 and I thought it was fine, awesome price, you get free breakfast (croisants & fruit) the hotel inside was nice, our room was totally clean, and I found the staff was really helpful, even after the guy I was sharing a room with was rude to them. The person I stayed with had a BIG problem with the noise in this hotel (as he did with almost every hotel), even though I thought it was totally ignoreable. Personally when I go to LA, I'm out all day until I'm dead tired and when I get back to the hotel I crash like a brick, and then I'm up and out as quick as possible the next day - so as long as the bed doesn't stick and the bathroom looks sanitary, and they're not like, drilling a hole in the ceiling I'm a happy camper, and this was more than satisfactory. So if you don't care if your hotel isn't the ""ritz"" and can sleap through a little bit of hallway noise this hotel is totally fine. You would have to have a car here cuz it's not really walking distance to anything, but the parking is free and there's LOTS of it - basically if you're not a hotel snob this hotel will suit you just fine, just as most hotels you stay in probably do.

Happiness25276,1,,,,2005-01-03,4,Pleasantly surprised!,"I read the reviews of this hotel only days before leaving on vacation, so I was pleasantly surprised when I found clean and very acceptable accomodations and not the ""Bates Motel Revisited"".  We travel quite a bit, and I'm particularly critical of hotels.  While the location was not exactly ""Hollywood"", it was only a short distance from Griffith Park.  

We stayed three nights for the Rose Bowl, and the only night I heard any noise from the room whatsoever was New Years Eve.  Our room was on the second floor, and faced the courtyard.  The bathroom was very good sized, and the room was adequate (though the bed and pillows a bit hard like all hotels)  The staff was accomodating and quick, extra towels were brought up to the room within 20 minutes of calling the front desk.  The included continental breakfast was above average, however there wasn't any fresh fruit, which would have been nice.

Overall, I think some of the previous reviewers were ridiculously critical, and I can say in all honesty, this was not only a perfectly acceptable business class hotel, but the least expensive one we've stayed at all year.  Only $79 per night over a holiday weekend.  I would stay here again.

GrandTour17357,1,,,,2004-05-10,3,Good budget hotel,"Stayed at the Ramada from Apr 26 to May 4 2004. Advantages: The location. It's a hop, skip and jump from the Metro station, and just a few stops away from Universal Studios, Hollywood Boulevard and downtown LA. It's just down the road from Sunset Blvd and boho enclave Los Feliz and is handy for buses and banks. Staff are courteous, efficient and eager to help and the rooms are neat and clean. There's a good comedy night on Mondays in the bar, and it's got a nice swimming pool. 
Disadvantages: The juice in the breakfast room tastes like it's been watered down, and Metro trains are very infrequent in the evenings so can be a bit of a drag when you want to go out - get a taxi instead. Air con in the rooms is quite loud, but maybe this is normal.

Escape2688,2,,,,2004-05-04,2,Rude staff spoil stay,"When there are thousands of other options in LA there is little reason to bother with this place. After staying for six nights I told the front desk that I would like to extend my stay after the weekend. 

No problem and at the same rate according to the first person I spoke to. Just come by on Sunday and we will sort it out. Sure enough, show up on the Sunday and the surly hotel (!) manager called Roman says, sure you can stay for $20 more than the rate you've been paying. 

Now, if the rates have gone up in a week, sure, but as someone who had already stayed a week, and handed over close to $1000 and been told there was no problem with an extra night, I want a better attitude and a better rate when I want to extend by a night. ""Was the person authorised to give you that rate?"" belched Roman when I told him I'd already struck a deal with his staff earlier. I dunno Roman but I am authorised to advise people to avoid your pkace in the future. 

The rest of the staff, especially at breakfast, are extremely friendly and helpful, but management should learn some customer service skills. Another thing, the $9 parking charge is a rort in a city like LA. I am not a tourist but a frequent business traveller to California. Roman's way has cost his doss house not just my future custom but that of my colleagues, associates, and friends.",,,,,,,,,,,,15

OnAir36651,1,,,,2004-03-21,3,Good and bad,"There were good and bad things about this hotel. Good things included cheap rates and close to bus/metro stops. These are a must if you don't want to spend tons on taxi fares. In a lot of ways though, it still would have been nice to have been more centrall located...maybe West Hollywood or Beverly Hills. The neighborhood was entirely iffy...don't go walking about by yourself at night, but the hotel is very secure.

I would consider the rooms entirely average for hotel rooms. I know a lot of people have been complaining on this site about them, but I bet if they had looked at their room at check in and asked for something to be changed, it would have been. The cleaning staff was very polite and efficient, so I doubt it would have been a problem.

Noise is a problem in this hotel, so if you are a person who likes to go to bed before 2 AM, make sure you get a room on the third floor and not on the street...once again, I bet if its a normal week they have some open so if you check in and don't like your room location ask for a different one. At the same time, if you want some entertainment, having the bar downstairs is really helpful. Check out the comedy shows a couple of nights a week...its a nice mix of up-and-comers at various levels of talent, but all in all, worth checking out.

Lastly, the hotel staff is not overly friendly, but they will help you out. Just be nice to them and tell them exactly what you want/need and they will try to do it.

Oh, and one last tip... although it takes a little over an hour, if its not your first time on a subway, you should try to take the metro/metro shuttle from LAX.....it cost 2 of us $2.50 as opposed to the $40-$50 bucks that it costs a taxi or shuttle service.",,,,,,,,,,,,9

Extraordinary19738,1,,,,2004-02-07,3,Not bad for the price,"The neighborhood isn't that bad and I felt safe even after coming back to my hotel very late at night. The staff was friendly and helpful, cannot complain there. I was a little disappointed in my room, but the cost was very low so you get what you pay for. The room was very tiny and the bed not as comfortable. The decor is usual style, nothing fabulous and my balcony faced Vermont Street. Not very pretty, but I didn't care. If you just want a nice place to sleep and don't plan on spending all your time in your room, this isn't bad. If you plan on staying in your room a lot, make sure you get a room by the pool.",,,,,,,,,,,,4
Coastal35109,1,,,,2004-01-22,5,Extremely helpful and accomodating,"I want to compliment the front desk reception staff. They are extremely helpful and accomodating. I was having difficulty obtaining a taxi in downtown LA, and after 10 minutes of calling a taxi number at which there was no answer, I called the front desk at the Ramada where I was staying and asked if they could help me. I was placed on hold while they called a taxi for me and then gave me the information. The staff went above and beyond their duties. Because of this positive experience, I will stay at a Ramada again. This was the first time, I had ever stayed at a Ramada. Thank you again.",,,,,,,,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-27,"Dear Guest,

ryntyntyn,9,,,,2004-01-12,2,Mixed review,"This hotel is a real study in contrasts. I was really thrown by the neighborhood.Wow! It's the kind to drive through with your windows up and doors locked. The room that we had was a queen double. The drapes and bedspreads were shabby altho the room was clean. I hope the other rooms are nicer.The bathroom was a bit on the small side and had a newer countertop ,,but really lacked counterspace.Our second floor balcony overlooked the parking lot,however, our room was quiet.The staff was efficient altho not overly friendly.The lower level where breakfast is served made me think I was in a different hotel. Recently redone with a ton of marble,new furnishings etc. There were nice choices for the breakfast buffet.",,,,,,,,,,,,10
Relax19994,2,,,,2004-01-04,4,Very nice Hotel,"Just stayed at the Ramada Inn Hollywood for a week over New Year. The staff were very nice and helpful after we had been let down by another hotel at the last minute. We were given a very large King room at a very good price, the room was very clean with a nice bathroom. Patio doors led onto a balcony overlooking a nice little courtyard with a fountain. The hotel is only 5 mins walk from the Metro station which was very useful for getting into downtown etc. The only negative is that they charged $9 a night to park in the car park with I don't think they should do for residents. Apart from that I can't fault it and recommend it.",,,,,,,,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-30,"Dear Guest,

Climber15252,1,,,,2003-09-13,4,Pretty Good,"I couldn't really fault this hotel. The standard of accomodation was good, a nice marble lobby and good quality accomodation with 28 inch TV and nice clean bathroom. Continental breakfast was included and the selection was quite good with Donuts, Toast, Coffee, Fruit Juices plenty to set you up for a day's sightseeing. I didn't hire a car so Transportation wise it was a short walk to the Metro Station which takes you to the heart of Hollywood Boulevard and Universal Studios also an easy walk to the main roads for catching busses. At the end of the day if you want to pay double (at least) to stay in Beverly Hills then fair enough, but if like me your on a budget then this would be an excellent choice.",,,,,,,,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-30,"Dear Guest,

Dream10424,2,,,,2003-08-26,1,Ghetto Hotel-Don't stay here.,"When we got there at 9pm on a Friday night we were told there was only 1 room left. It was on the ground floor right on busy Vermont Ave. You could hear traffic and busses and honking day and night. What's worse is that we were right above the bar and you could hear loud music and people laughing till 2am every night. The bed was lumpy and the room had old, worn out, and stained curtains, matress, and bed coverings. 
Even some of the towels had awful brown stains on them! Yuck! One night we came home late from the bar and there was no parking because they let anyone off the street visit their bar and park in the hotel guest parking lot taking up all the spots.(but they sure charge you $9/day 4 the parking). There were even 4 trucks parked in the parking lot that belonged to Out of the Closet clothing store next door. This hotel needs to plan things better. Instead of building a stupid fountain in the front they need to build a parking garage and put the bar under the executive offices or the lobby or something like that. They should build a wall on the Vermont side with climing Ivy or something to drown out the street noise, and they definetly need new towels, mattresses, and updates to the rooms. Very Unhappy Camper from Northern Cal.",,,,,,,,,,,,7
Safari30075,1,,,,2003-05-21,4,On the whole pretty good,"We stayed here for 3 nights and found it to be - not a 5 star hotel of course, but on the whole pretty good for what we paid (through Expedia). Even for their standard rates it would be a decent deal. The room was clean (housekeeping did a great job each day), felt safe and had a nice biggish bathroom, cable and access to cable internet (for a daily price). We got a non-smoking room and it actually smelt like a non-smoking room (ie. no stale cigarette smoke!). The breakfast was plentiful and the staff were really friendly & helpful. Access to a laundry within the hotel was great. The neighborhood wasn't totally upmarket and the car park was a bit open, but it was staffed well and we had no problems and felt safe. Definitely a good place to stay especially if you can get a deal! We stayed in enough hotels through the US to rate this one as being good value for the money.",,,,,,,,Gisel Miller,Other,2020-03-30,"Dear Guest,

Adventure10413,1,,,,2003-04-06,2,Hollywood Tourist Trap,"As a business traveler and trade show planner I have had the best and worst. We booked 26 room nights in the hotel for a trade show March 24 through March 28, 2003. This place rates right at the bottom in terms of customer service and good old fashioned hospitality. The staff was less than courteous and the facilities were lacking quite a bit of the ammenities offered by even the most budget minded chains. No newspapers, telephone and dial-up rates that would balance the national debt, and a snotty barman that refused to allow us to watch the tv in the bar unless we paid 30 bucks to make it ""worth his time"". If you only want a cheap room with secure access, book the discount rate at any of the travel discount sites then settle back and prepare to be completely frustrated by the incompetence and arrogance of the staff; save Carol at the front desk, the sole exception whom I  believe has the toughest job in Hollywood. To sum up the problems, the manager told me at check-out, ""I hear so many problems, there is no way to keep up with them all."" Enough said sir, I understand.",,,,,,,,,,,,14
