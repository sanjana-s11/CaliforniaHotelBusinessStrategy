Wander783351,2,,2021-11-30,FRIENDS,2021-12-04,5,Most Helpful Front Desk,"Ive never written a hotel review. But my experience at the Roosevelt prompted me to find this site and share my incredible experience with the most helpful Front Desk. I booked my reservation thru a third party, which would only allow me to book for one night. Because I was traveling with kids and it was all last minute and our first fun trip during Covid, I just took what I could get and showed up. Dustin, the Front Desk specialist, helped me after a long 8 hour drive. He listened to my pathetic story of attempting to book online and then solved all my issues. He figured out my room situation, was super patient, gave me lots of tips. The other Front Desk person, Jose, was also very helpful. Together, they solved what could have been a one night stay and moving around or to another hotel.
We had a terrific time at the Hotel. We had dinner at the very chic Barish, enjoyed the pool scene and the easy walkability to check out Hollywood Boulevard. Traveling with teens is always moody but their moods were great with so many cool things to look at and explore in the actual Hotel. Thank you Dustin and Roosevelt! We’ll see you on the next trip!",,,,,,,,,,,,1

The pool is incredible but get there early to get a great seat.   There are a lot of guests who go fully clothed and just stare at their phone, which is obnoxious.  also, their restaurant 25 degrees is really yummy .

Situated on a busy, street, sometimes riddled with homeless people wandering aimlessly around.  Hotel room was satisfactory, although the bathroom is quite small.  The staff was very hospitable and set up with champagne and my favorite parisian macaroons!  Class act.   We learned from the concierge that there is a shuttle 2 blocks away that will take guests to the Hollywood Bowl.  That was a bonus that we did not have to fight the crowds with a vehicle.

Carissa B,2,,2021-11-30,COUPLES,2021-11-25,2,Don’t stay here if there’s an event,"I was so excited to stay here because of the history, but I’ve honestly never had a worse hotel experience. When we checked in we were told that there was a private event tonight and it might be loud outside the room we booked. My husband and I weren’t bothered, it’s downtown LA, I expect loud.

That did not end up being a problem, what did end up being a problem is that when we got back from our night out we had to wade through a packed crowd of teenagers (unmasked) to get to the front door where they asked if we had a key to prove we were staying there (we did) and that we needed to go around back to the valet entrance.

Did that, had to get through another crowd of teenagers to barricades they’d put up. Security asked to for our name and room number to check a list. Then they told us they already let in people who were staying in that room and that we couldn’t come in. Mind you all our things were already in our room. I had to stand there getting harassed while I argued with the security until the front desk manager who checked us in saw us and told them to let us in. 

Of course we got stopped (by being yelled at) two more times on our way to our room and had to show them my ID and key card.

I called the front desk once we finally got to our room and the man who answered was very sympathetic and did a lot to make me feel better. He told me he could definitely get me a $75 credit for food. Then he called back a couple minutes later to say he got the manager to give us $150 credit towards food and drinks. 

The next two days were uneventful, but of course we’ve checked out and didn’t have the credit applied so I’m about to call, yet again. 

The hotel itself is beautiful and the food and drinks were good, but staying there was an absolute ordeal that made our whole vacation stressful. We’ll definitely stay somewhere else when we come back next year.",,,,,,,,A H,Other,2021-11-29,"Dear Carissa,

We appreciate your candid review, which helps us in our continual quest for improvement. I apologize for the inconvenience you experienced getting into your room with  added security in place, and am glad we could make sure you felt welcome with a food and beverage credit. I will personally oversee making sure that credit gets applied to your final bill, and I do hope you both will consider joining us again one day, so that we might earn your full approval.

Ilana,1,,2021-11-30,NONE,2021-11-22,2,Couldn't enjoy stay,"We decided to stay in The Roosevelt Hotel last weekend (11/12-11/15) to attend the Vulture Festival which takes place there. The price was a bit higher than we would have liked to spend, but thought it would be worth it to be staying in the same place the festival was being held. 

There weren't too many hiccups in the beginning (besides me being double booked and charged twice, but hotel staff quickly took care of that). Check-In was easy and the hotel staff was great. 

The room itself was also nice, no complaints there. The only gripe I had was that there was only 1 elevator for all of the guests and service workers at the hotel, so wait times were a bit high. 

The main issue came from the security stationed at the hotel during Vulturefest. We had tickets and were super exciting to be staying on the premise, but the security ruined our stay here. We were asked multiple times per day if we were guests of the hotel and you can tell security was surprised to hear us say yes. They still told us to move about 10-15 times per day while we were hanging out at the hotel. They made us feel like we didn't belong when they questioned us and we did not get to enjoy out time there. They were also unnecessarily rude to us on multiple occasions when walking about the hotel. 

If you're planning on staying at The Roosevelt Hotel during an event there, I would highly advise against it. 

I gave the hotel 2 stars because the staff was fantastic and super nice.",,,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,A H,Other,2021-11-23,"Dear 380ilanam,

It was nice having a separate bedroom area with a barn door to close. There was also a very small 1/2 bath in the living area. We joined the iPrefer loyalty program prior to our stay, since we frequently travel to LA and intended to stay at this hotel in the future. In the past 6 weeks, however, we have been unable to receive the loyalty points for our stay, despite several times being told by the front desk staff that our iPrefer number was on the reservation.

The property and staff were excellent and we experienced some of the grandeur of old Hollywood.  Our cabana balcony room was quiet and comfortable.  The hotel is close to all of the glitzy tourist traps, walk of fame stars and museums in the area.  We enjoyed several restaurants that were within walking distance of the hotel.  Musso & Frank's Grill was great and we spent some time at Mel's, our go to for diner food. There is an IN n OUT Burger about 3 blocks away if you are interested.  Only had drinks at 25 degrees, the hotel's restaurant, but the burger's coming out looked very appetizing. There is a Target across the street that offers many items you may need or have forgotten.  They offer liquor, beer and mixers for those wishing to cut down on the bar bill. There are 7 11's and some local shops to meet most of your needs.  The coffee shop next to the hotel opens early and has snacks, beverages and a great staff.

We were hungry and were told the restaurant there would be closing soon so it became our next stop. 

The man at the restaurant was kind and efficient. It was nice to have just checked in and charge the order to our room. We ordered room service in the morning that was brought by that same man the night before. It was presented beautifully on tray and the steak and eggs were amazing!

We explored the hotel in the morning and my only regret is we didn't have more time there. We're planning to return and stay in different rooms cause we loved it so much. We want to spend time just hanging out here next stay. Walking out from the street entrance there's so much to do!

We met Robert near the street entrance and loved him. People like him add to this places' magic. He was kind and informative about the hotels history.

AndHeresLilly,7,"Foster City, California",2021-10-31,FRIENDS,2021-10-11,5,Hollywood October Respite,"Every year we like to go to the local Halloween haunts and decided to stay near Universal Studios where we went to  Horror Night.  This was the first time at the hotel and soooo glad we stayed here.  The nostalgia and beauty of the hotel just added the right atmosphere of our adventure.  We asked for a tour of Marilyn Monroe’s suite she used to stay in and Gabby from the front desk accommodated our request.  Although we didn’t feel her presence at the moment we were in awe just to be in a room where such a beautiful person inside and out stayed.
EJ with maintenance was extremely helpful with information about the hotel including the Marilyn Monroe mirror by the stairs and the apt on the roof top where Johnny Grant, former honorary Mayor of Hollywood, used to live.
It was convenient having the dining choices from fine dining at Barish, 25 degrees cafe, pool side dining to room service, where the service was excellent.  The overall staff was very kind and helpful and truly dedicated to a wonderful customer experience.  
We will definitely return (Maybe visit Montgomery Cliff’s room and hear him playing his bugle)",,,,,,,,A H,Other,2021-10-12,"Dear AndHeresLilly,

Sbain76,40,"Temecula, California",2021-09-30,COUPLES,2021-09-27,1,Incredible hotel.   Very poor service.,"This is a very cool hotel. Amazing pool & fun place. All was good until my wife left her purse at the restaurant in the hotel the night before, and realized it the morning after. They say the bad times differentiate the best organizations. This was the point this hotel fell flat on its face. Dismissal, didn’t care, wouldn’t help at the front desk, beyond terrible service.  We made at least 20 phone calls back here…frankly, we would have gotten more help finding her purse from a complete unpaid stranger, or the Motel 6. They even argued over how we were going to pay for it…we spent $800 in less than 24 hours there on the room and multiple meals and drinks, and it took multiple calls to figure out who was paying for the shipping for my wife’s purse and which account. Who cares, we just want the purse back. Ridiculous. So sadly, this level of service is intolerable to me, so we will not return.",,,,,,,,A H,Other,2021-09-29,"Dear Shain76,

Tenzopolis,33,"Portland, Oregon",2021-09-30,NONE,2021-09-27,2,Cabana Building Review,"The Hollywood Roosevelt has two buildings in which to stay: The Tower building and the Cabana building.  The Tower is a 12-story building with 300 rooms and suites and the Cabana building  is a series of rooms and suites that surround the Tropicana Pool.  This is a review of our five days stay at a Cabana Poolside Room (115).

Cabana Poolside rooms are 350 square feet with a sliding glass door leading to a patio with a day bed and the pool is a few feet further.  We chose to stay in a Cabana Poolside in order to have immediate access to the pool from our room.

(Note: The website boasts Cabana Pool Suites with enclosed fires on the patios, but neither of us could find such a thing during our stay, but there is a fire AT the pool.)

On the exterior of the entire Cabana building are sound speakers for music piped in from the Tropicana Bar.  This music begins at 8am and does not end until the bar closes around 11PM or later.  The music can be heard from inside the room, in some cases more loudly than other rooms, depending upon where the speakers are located in relation to the rooms.  On Monday, when the bar closed, the staff neglected to turn off the music.  At midnight, I had to call the front desk to inform the staff to turn it off.

There are events that happen poolside Tuesdays and Thursdays.  Currently, Tuesdays are movie nights and Thursdays are 80's music nights (confirm with website as these dates may change).  My girlfriend and I were at the pool on Tuesday around 4pm (the events begin around 8pm) when a team of hotel staff were setting up for the event, thereby blocking our ability to get back into our room.  Although we knew the events would be happening, nobody at the front desk informed us when we checked in, nor on the day, that the setup for the event would block access to our room.  When I asked them to unblock the room so we could get back in, they said they couldn't.  They had just blocked it by moving table umbrellas and some potted foliage, so they most certainly could have unblocked it, but wouldn't.  My girlfriend was in a tiny bikini with no shoes and they told us we would need to go to the lobby to get the front desk for help.  My girlfriend ended up crawling through the foliage, with the branches scratching her, to get back to our room because there's no way she would have been comfortable walking through the lobby with no shoes, practically naked.  It was insulting, inconsiderate and thoughtless.

Staying in a Poolside Cabana also meant bug bites.  Every night, we would wake up with more bug bites.  It's been a week, and I'm still scratching.

The website boasts robes and HiDef Flat Screen TV.  There were no robes (although there were flip flops which if you used them, you'd be charged for them) and the TV could not maintain a steady signal.  The sound dropped out constantly and the image would stagger.  Wi-Fi access was free with a code from the front desk.

The day we checked into our room, maintenance informed us that one of the mirrors in the bathroom was broken and asked if they wanted us to have it fixed, but that they wouldn't be able to do it for a few days.  There was also a broken light fixture by the bed. Why were we given a room with known broken amenities?  

The room has a small table with two fixed chairs facing each other, which seemed like it would have been a workable area, however, there are no accessible outlets at this table for connecting power to a laptop.  The only accessible outlets are located on either side of the bed, not ideal for working.

The bed is low and soft, which is problematic for an older person from which to stand.  The pillows have no structure, so offer no support.

Neighboring noise from rooms can be heard easily through the thin walls.

Housekeeping is thorough and polite.  However, on our last day, they knocked on our door at 8:30am to do our room (check out is noon).

The pool itself is a kind of perfection.  It is perfectly heated with a gorgeous mural by painter David Hockney that shimmers when the water moves.  The day beds are plentiful.  Be aware that this property offers day passes for its pool through a third-party website, which may limit your access to the day beds unless you grab one early.  The towels can be picked up at the entrance to the Tropicana Pool, but there is no place to dispose the towels after use and so they tend to accumulate around the pool area.  That said, the attendees are mindful about day bed maintenance.  

Poolside food can be ordered via phone app and arrives in a timely manner.  The menu items are not unique and the quality is standard with high prices you'd expect (18% gratuity is included in everything, including drinks--$18 total for a Tanqueray and tonic, for example).

There are many choices for hotels throughout LA and I was disappointed that The Roosevelt was resting on its history and not offering consistent customer care nor paid attention to details like basic room maintenance.  It would really require management to offer us a do-over for us to consider ever staying there again.",,3.0,2.0,,5.0,,,A H,Other,2021-09-28,"Dear Tenzopolis,

Cori aka Cori,11,"Laguna Beach, California",2021-09-30,NONE,2021-09-21,3,Disappointing Birthday Stay,"We were here for a milestone birthday and let the hotel know about it in advance.  We arrived early and held our bags at the Bell Desk.  We were told we would be in room 1111, but when we came back to check in, we were given room 1130.  Room 1130 was dark & dilapidated.  Tile in the bathroom were visibly worn. There appeared to be a missing picture above the bed or it was really strange placement of 1 small picture above 1 side of the bed. Another picture looked on the side of the bed looked like it was missing the picture.  It added a bit of darkness to an already dark room. 
The rug under the desk where the hole was cut out for the plug was worn. The paint in the hallways were dark & dreary in my opinion.

The pool area closed down early for a private event, so we weren't able to enjoy the area or cafe for very long since check-in was at 4 PM and the pool closed at 6 PM.  

My husband went to the front desk to state that the hotel room was not as expected in location and quality.  He was NOT offered an apology, room change or upgrade, so he asked if we could depart 1-day earlier than our reservation was for and that's what we did.

I expected more from a landmark hotel with such a rich history of beauty and service. The lobby areas and restaurant were great, but the hotel room we were in seemed to be bottom of the barrel.  We even booked direct with the hotel because we liked the brand, but seemed to be given a room reserved for online travel consolidators which was very disappointing.",,,,,,,,A H,Other,2021-09-22,"Dear clahners,

Stephanie F,3,,2021-09-30,BUSINESS,2021-09-15,4,Convenient Hollywood Location,"I stayed here to attend an event and the Chinese Theatre which is across the street from the hotel. The hotel has a lot of charm and history, and you will pay for it. The Tropicana Pool is well-known for its movie nights and weekend luaus, which can be a fun distraction if you have the time. The standard rooms are much smaller than other hotels of this rating and this price, but they're nice and clean, and that's what you get in major metropolitan areas of expensive cities like Los Angeles and New York City. If you want to be convenient to a lot of things, and you want to stay someplace nice and safe, you're going to pay for it. That being said, the rooms are very reasonable for the area and comparable to other hotels of similar caliber in the neighborhood. One thing I found a bit INconvenient was that it was the only luxury hotel I've ever stayed in that didn't have a little store to pick up anything you may have forgotten at home, i.e. toothbrush, comb, or perhaps you just want a bottle of water (which is not in your room) or a snack. That was a bummer. Some billing issues on the way out the door in that they charged me for my room stay twice, but it was eventually resolved. All-in-all, it was a nice stay. I may return if I have another event at Hollywood & Highland, otherwise I may seek other options.",,4.0,4.0,,,4.0,,A H,Other,2021-09-16,"Dear sfred575,

MDW2757,27,"Baton Rouge, Louisiana",2021-09-30,NONE,2021-09-15,4,Beautiful hotel with lots of history,"Love this hotel and I would definitely stay there again.  It is beautiful and has some amazing history.  Everyone was super nice and gave us lots of information.  Our bellman, Chris (not sure which one as we were told there were 5) was so nice and informative.  Then E.J. brought us a rollaway bed.  Had a great conversation with him.  He told us more interesting history about the hotel.  
The bathrooms are a little small BUT that comes along with an older hotel.  It was no big deal.  

The only negative for us would be the lobby bar closing early.  We attended a concert at the Hollywood Bowl one evening.  Walked back to the hotel and wanted to enjoy a cocktail with our family & friends.  Gentleman in black suit told us the bar was closed and then proceeded to tell us how to exit the hotel.  Kinda rude and presumptuous.   We told him we were guests of the hotel and was there anything in the hotel still opened.  We were told the pool bar would be opened for another 30 minutes or so.  We were a little surprised!  Went down to the pool and the workers acted like we were a nuisance.  Not sure what was going on.  Perhaps they were ready to end their shift.",,,5.0,,5.0,4.0,,A H,Other,2021-09-16,"Dear MDW2757,

We had such a great weekend getaway for my son's 16th birthday- (we live only less than a half-hour away at the beach) We splurged on a cabana pool room and then a normal room to accommodate my son and his friends.  I could have never pulled it off if not for the great help of so many people there.  Jennifer in group sales helped me first off with the planning and securing of rooms and then Gaby at the front desk was so patient answering my many questions about everything so I could try to plan better.  Thanks also to Will ( the bellman), Tye, Michael, and Jordan to name a few.  Jennifer even called me after the weekend to see how everything went.  So impressed with the hotel and their hospitality.  The pool is great but can be crowed on a beautiful day so you just have to be patient or get there early to get a good spot to relax and enjoy.  There is a terrific burlesque/cabaret show on the weekend that my husband and I snuck off to for a few hours which was great and in the hotel theater.  Terrific talented dancers and the adult show is very classy and empowering!  Great hotel with great Hollywood history and it was so fun to have a change of scenery from the beach scene and the overcast skies.

mariajeong,25,"San Francisco, California",2021-08-31,COUPLES,2021-09-03,4,A historic hotel with a beautiful pool,"We enjoyed a 4 night stay here and took advantage of the beautiful, relaxing pool and rooftop yoga!  We had a room on the 3rd floor with frosted windows so didn’t have a view, but we didn’t spend too much time in the room as it’s centrally located with lots to do in/around the hotel. 

However, I’m not able to give 5 stars because the guest elevators were broken on Thursday afternoon when we checked-in. A hotel employee was helping manage the crowds into the service elevator to only allow 3 people at a time in - which I highly appreciated given COVID. Unfortunately later that night, the employee was gone so a verbal altercation took place in the elevator because too many people tried to get on the elevator without wearing masks. I think signage on mask policy and 3 people limit would have been helpful to avoid these situations. 

Secondly and more importantly, we were denied a late checkout by the front desk manager, Shanna Kraaijeveld​, who had terrible attitude. Instead of apologizing for denying my polite request
(I talked to her in person and explained that our flight had been delayed), she was very rude and insisted that she needed my exact room back by noon on the dot and that she won’t do a late checkout - even when I called back and offered to pay for an extension. Her response and attitude was so ridiculous that I had to get in touch with management for an exception and was able to get my late checkout anyway. 

It’s unfortunate that it takes only one person to ruin your otherwise 5-star stay with exceptional service from everyone throughout the 4 nights. Thanks to Don and everyone else on the team for making our stay superb and memorable.

I’m an ex-consultant with lifetime loyalty status at the major hotel chains, but I’m so glad I tried out this historic hotel on my vacation even though I had to jump some major hoops to get late checkout.",,,,,,,,A H,Other,2021-09-07,"Dear mariajeong,

Thank you for relaxing with us for your four-night stay.

Bill gave us a personalized Q and A here at the hotel.  A small group of us rented the most haunted room in the hotel and were hoping to feel an experience within our room. When the morning security saw us come in with cameras, they immediately told us to put everything away and not to be wandering the halls or we would be kicked out. Out of respect to the staff and other guests, we stayed in our room. But late in the night, we ventured out to walk around for a bit when we ran into Bill. He gave us his view on guests investigating the roosevelt. He likes to find out what people's visits are there for and trys his best to make it a special stay for guests. And boy did he make it unique! He showed us the local spots and gave us some background info on the supposed hauntings of certain artifacts and locations.  Bill is extremely knowledgeable on the hotel history and their legendary guests. Made it so unique and fun for our party. Thanks you Bill! This guys should be employee of the year!

Choosing the theme Hollywood Romance we each happily booked a cabana room at the Hollywood Roosevelt.  

We were pleasantly surprised at the high level of service and friendliness provided by the hotel staff. From the moment we were welcomed by the valets and bellmen to our departure everyone was pleasantly attentive. The young man at reception seemed genuinely happy to welcome us and gave us four complementary drink coupons for use at the onsite bars or restaurants. And later we found a bottle of Italian Prosecco and a small box of French macaron cookies - a very nice touch reminiscent of the finest European hotels. In the hallways we were greeted by maids and poolside we were immediately acknowledged by waitstaff. Though masked, everyone seemed delighted we were there.

The pool scene is vibrant and bustling with young families, gorgeous youths waiting to be discovered, and older sedate gentlefolk all enjoying the lush oasis in the middle of a noisy throbbing city.

We always found the lobby, the theater, the restaurants and bars to be busy and energetic.

Needless to say, we loved the experience and wished we’d planned more than one too short day to spend at the Hollywood Roosevelt. Looking forward to another visit.",Pets are welcome.,,,,,,,A H,Other,2021-08-30,"Dear Bellauno,

bk_bee,3173,"Brooklyn, New York",2021-07-31,BUSINESS,2021-07-28,4,Great Choice For Stressful Business Trip,"I work in commercial production and had to travel to LA for a 4-day studio shoot out in Sun Valley- my first non-remote production since 2019!

I picked the Hollywood Roosevelt because I wanted to be able to walk off property and find a drugstore and a coffee shop within walking distance, plus, having stayed in a poolside cabana room back in 2006, I know the hotel is gorgeous.

I definitely made the right choice!

My company booked me into a deluxe tower room but I received a complimentary upgrade to a poolside cabana room, which I loved!  I woke up each morning at 5am, went out to my private patio and watched the sun rise over the big, iconic Hollywood Roosevelt sign.  It was heavenly.  

The only issues I had with my room was I noticed there were weird stains on the wooden headboard- I think it was soy sauce.  I cleaned them off with a wet wash cloth.  And the drain in the shower was really backed up, so I stopped off at reception at around 9am my second day there and asked if a maintenance engineer could fix it while I was out for the day.  I also asked for extra towels and some more bath gel.  Got back at 8pm and found that my shower drained properly, I had a ton of towels and some extra bath gel.  Loved it!

Outside of those two things, the only downside I experienced was breakfast at the Tropicana Cafe.  The servers were lovely, but I was served extremely rancid orange juice- it was so fizzy I had to ask if they'd accidentally served me a mimosa.  The food was very meh, but the coffee was good.  

Oh, and I had a really good time walking the 2 blocks to CVS- I picked up everything I needed there and was back in my hotel room in under 20 minutes.

Will definitely book the Hollywood Roosevelt next time I'm in town for that type of trip.","the music in the pool area is very loud at night, so you may not like the cabana rooms if you like it quiet after sundown.",5.0,5.0,,,,4.0,A H,Other,2021-07-29,"Dear fltbsh,

shaunaelisa,22,"Brooklyn, New York",2021-07-31,COUPLES,2021-07-28,5,The most amazing hotel stay ever!,"I can’t say enough how amazing of the time that we had during our stay at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel. When we first checked in we went to our cabana room. The cabana room wasn’t the right fit for us, and when we spoke to management that we weren’t happy about the room they switched us to a suite in the tower. Our suite in the tower was the most beautiful hotel room I’ve ever stayed in. We had the most amazing views of Hollywood Boulevard, the Hollywood sign, Hollywood high school, and more! 

Whenever we needed something, towels, etc the service was always impeccable. All of the staff are incredibly friendly, helpful, and kind. Sometimes at high end resorts and hotels I feel like I don’t fit in, but I never at any point felt this way at the Hollywood Roosevelt. Everyone was down to earth and respectful and overall there was just such a good vibe at the hotel! Other high end hotels should emulate what has been captured at this hotel because it was a truly special experience for us, unlike any other.

The hotel is renovated, but still maintains a classic old Hollywood charm. The grounds were extremely clean as was our room. As an art teacher and artist, I was amazed by the art in the hotel and how it connected the history of the hotel and it’s guests with contemporary style! It makes me so happy to be able to experience a historical hotel and see that it is being preserved, but also improved upon with modern comforts. 

Lastly, swimming in the David Hockney pool was the most incredible experience EVER! As a painter, it was the coolest swimming experience I’ve ever had in my life. The water was a perfect temperature and I loved how it was deep and so big that you could really swim and enjoy it. My only wish is that it was open later because I’m a big fan of a nighttime swim (closed at 7pm). Poolside cocktails were delicious and there were some really cute puppies poolside too. Hehe.

I overall had the best time ever and I hope to stay here again in the future!  I can’t thank the management and staff enough for ensuring we had a wonderful stay. Thank you so much!",,,,,,,,A H,Other,2021-07-29,"Hello shaunelisa,

Incredible location, plus nice restaurants and lobby (good hamburgers at 25 Degrees). The best part is the lively, beautiful pool, which has 3 bar/restaurants in summer, fun music, and floats to play on. The water was almost too warm and chairs took a long time to get (we should have some down by 10:30 probably), but we bought a deck of cards, had a light meal and drinks, swam and enjoyed the atmosphere while waiting.

Steve G,4,"California City, California",2021-07-31,NONE,2021-07-14,5,The Best Choice,"The Hollywood Roosevelt is a historic hotel right in the heart of Hollywood.  The Chinese Theater, the Dolby Theater and shopping are right across the street.  Even with all the traffic on Hollywood Blvd, the hotel was very quiet.  The interior is charming, well maintained and secure.

The entire staff was very friendly and helpful.  But in particular, the valet and bell staff made checking in and out so simple and pleasant.  There was never a worry about what to do with our car and how we would move all our luggage.  Be sure and tip valet and bell generously for all their hard work.

Our room was on the 5th floor at the back.  We had three large windows with a sweeping view of Los Angeles.  While booking the room we chose the offer to upgrade to a Double Deluxe and are very glad we did.  The room had ample space and a large bathroom with an unusually large shower.  The room had hardwood floors with a large rug.  The beds had an interesting wood frame support and were very comfortable.  Watch your shins around the corners of the beds!

In the room the hotel had available for purchase water in glass (!) bottles, snacks, hard and soft drinks and even very useful electronics.  Prices were very reasonable.  Room service from a top end restaurant downstairs was available.  We had dinner in the restaurant and was well worth the price as a treat to ourselves.  For breakfast we chose the café at the front of the hotel.  Good selection of items, delicious and open all the time.

In late April/Early May I stayed at the HR in a poolside cabana street for 5 days and tip to toe, the service was outstanding. Quick room service, beautiful grounds, sexy and relaxing rooms with various mood lighting... a true trip to Hollywood glam. Vegas hotels have nice lobbies, then basic rooms. Not the HR. Everything is beautiful. The food is fantastic and service outstanding. 

Fast forward to last week: I unexpectedly had to spend the night in LA, my phone was dead and I forgot a charger, so what is a gal to do? 
Hop in a yellow cab and request a drop off at the only hotel I could think of sans tech. Spent the night in a tower room... lovely, but I’m a cabana gal, and I was yet again impressed. 

Unfortunately I was on my way to a funeral in Bakersfield, which turned out more difficult than one might imagine without a car, so I called the front desk and was connected to my angel, Jay. He  helped me brainstorm and made me laugh when I needed it most. 5 stars for the Roosevelt -and kind Jay as a cherry on top.",,,,,,,,A H,Other,2021-07-07,"Dear anniemmayo,

We upgraded to the double deluxe room for more space and glad we did so. I can't imagine how small the regular rooms are, given that the deluxe grade is not large by new-build standards. We had a view of Hollywood Blvd and could see the sign in the distance from our room window (which did open!). The room comes with all the extras you may want - booze, flip flops, snacks, water. The beds are quite comfortable and everything was very clean. My only minor complaint would be a larger mirror in the bathroom - though it'd take away from the hotel's classic feel.

The front desk staff and valet were very attentive and pleasant. The pool of course is a must. We did a Friday afternoon for a few hours and had to wait about 20 minutes for a poolside chair. Definitely plan to stay poolside for an evening and order dinner from 25 degrees - SO GOOD! They have a 3-hour time limit on chairs Sat/Sun and it is BUSY and a party scene. Not clear how well that rule is upheld.

The location is great - right across from the Dolby and all of the touristy must-dos. But, also be warned - the area does smell like human urine, there are people wigging out on drugs at all hours of the day and night, and much trash all-around. : /",,,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,A H,Other,2021-06-22,"Dear Deeee,

From the moment they arrived there my mother and niece were treated very well, the hotel is beautiful, the people are kind.
My mother is already elderly and she went to the pool and was very well received by Leila from the first contact she accommodated my mother in the pool.
 My mother told me that she was having difficulty getting up from the pool bed and Leila then went to talk to her and see if she was ok, at the same time she took the chair, helped my mother up and put a towel on her back, when my niece returned from the room she asked if my mother was feeling better, my mother replied “yes, the nice lady helped me” referring to Leila.  My niece immediately took a tip to give Leila, she didn't accept it and said she just wanted my mom to be more comfortable.
 My mother keeps asking me if I called the hotel to talk about this good deed, My niece suggested that we leave a review so that it could be seen by the hotel managers and owners, so on behalf of my mother I'm thanking for the gesture, every day she asks if I made a point of thanking the kind-hearted girl who helped her.

The issue for us was 1) the odd situation with the entire glorious lobby being closed off 2) the front desk was unaware we were eligible for a free upgrade even though it was on our reeervation email 3) we were charged for mini bar items we didn’t eat 4) there was no food available anywhere on Hollywood Blvd after 9pm for delivery,  We followed the hotel on social media and we were very excited about rooftop yoga, fun by the pool, the beautlful lobby, canopy beds- but we didn’t experience any of this and there was no INFORMATION about the hotel or amenities anywhere. When we asked we were told to
Google eventbrite. It was our first trip to California. I would say don’t stay here if it’s your first time to LA. Hollywood is very much a “see it all in 4 hours” area.

We were lucky enough to get a great rate on a Cabana room (with a porch!) but even at full price it would be worth the stay.  This hotel just oozes class and history, it’s like an oasis off of the bustle of Hollywood Blvd and you can see why it has stayed popular as long as it has.  Our room is classy and appointed beautifully and I honestly would even want to stay in the tower.  Getting to be so close to the pool is a huge plus and it really feels almost removed from everything.  The amenities are great even though some have been reduced for Covid times.  Only negatives are the cost of valet (but it’s Hollywood) and the lightning controls in the room are bizarrely confusing.

Amit,1,,2021-05-31,FAMILY,2021-06-01,1,Not a good place for families especially young children. ,"Not a good hotel for families, especially young kids.  

No parking besides $45 per day valet parking.  When we arrived, keys didnt work nor immediate housekeeping was available.  Cheaper parking is another complex and the neighborhood is nasty, foul smelling, filled with meth zombies and crazy's.  I used to live in the Tenderloin in SF and was pretty much what this place was. 

Thr hotel room was nothing to rave about.  Not sure if people are rating the hotel or the bar/pool scene but hotel rooms are 2 star, imo.  

The staff was friendly except for the check in/out staff.  During checkout, i was told my charges plus pending vellet parking BUT i never had vallet parking.  Then he just said ""ok, you're good."" I asked for a reciept or some proof that i wouldn't be charged for vallet since i never used it (i used a parking garage down the street) and he said they dont do that so i am watching my credit card like a hawk to see if they will try to sneek the charges on. 

For anyone with a family, i do not recommend this hotel at all.  As a kid, i used to live in SF Tenderloin district and i cannot believe i spent money to stay with my child at a hotel that reminded me of the Tenderloin. ","Inquire about parking as when i went, i was unaware that they only offer vallet parking and parking garage across the street was closed. Read up about the neighborhood.

Laura,1,"Los Angeles, California",2021-05-31,NONE,2021-05-25,4,"Fun, stylish place to stay","I will definitely stay at The Hollywood Roosevelt again, especially now that I know more about the rooms.

The first night I stayed in a Cabana room, and I'm glad I asked for one without a pool view, because the pool area is a party scene. I couldn't hear anything - music or chatter in my room, so that was nice. The room was dark and on the small side, but very nicely designed. It smelled of weed, which I didn't mind and actually liked because it seemed in keeping with the whole vibe of the place. But the mattress and pillows were extremely soft, so I woke up with a neck ache. And the drains - both sink and shower - were sluggish. Also, the HVAC system is old - when the fan was on, it blew directly onto my face and I had to use ear plugs because it was so loud. I overheard another guest telling the front desk that the plumbing in his Cabana room made clanking sounds. So...I won't be asking for a Cabana room again.

I asked to move, and they couldn't have been nicer - they moved me to a room on the 9th floor in the Tower. The Tower rooms don't have the same groovy design and vibe as the Cabana rooms, but they have much more light. The plumbing was great and the bed felt wonderful. They were playing a movie at the pool, and I could hear it from my room, even that far up, and even with the fan turned on. I didn't mind because I was watching a movie of my own on my laptop with ear buds. But it might have annoyed me otherwise. It went on past 10.

The hotel has so many zones and places to hang out that it would be easy not to leave. The pool is gorgeous, and there's a ""bridge"" with cafe tables and chairs overlooking it, if you want the mood but not the sun. The patio is beautiful, full of tropical plants and string lights that make it feel magical at night. And every single staff person I encountered was cheerful and helpful. And the old Hollywood part of the hotel has lots of nooks and crannies and a stunning lounge (currently closed because of COVID).

Next time I stay I will ask for a Tower room on a high floor facing north (away from the pool).",,,5.0,,4.0,,5.0,B P,Other,2021-05-27,"Dear laurawellergraham,

Harrison D,5,"Salt Lake City, Utah",2021-04-30,SOLO,2021-05-16,5,Home away from home,"I stayed at The Hollywood Roosevelt about two-ish weeks ago, and I was extremely excited to crash here for a few days while I had a tattoo appointment booked in DTLA. Knowing how historic this place was put it at the top of my list, but I went in expecting the same level of service I’ve received elsewhere in LA. I drove down from Salt Lake City in a single day, and didn’t check in until about 7PM. The service I received from dropping my car off at valet, until picking it up after checking out was continuously exceptional. The amazing woman working the front desk really set the tone for my stay, and I’m kicking myself for not catching her name. 

On top of that, having brunch on the day I checked out, I was served by Leila, and after reading all the other reviews, I realized I needed to throw my two cents in. Her and her colleague were working in the Johnny Grant Apartment since the pool was closed this particular weekend, and I was lucky enough to have them all to myself and had the absolute best conversations. 

What makes the Roosevelt stand out from what you’d except is it’s grit, it’s history, and it’s genuineness, in all facets. To me, what makes an experience go from exceptional to out-of-this-world is a sense of humanity. The person-to-person conversations and treatment made me know that this is by far my most favorite hotel I’ve ever had the pleasure of staying at.

I know without a doubt I will need to come back very VERY soon. I’m looking forward to seeing everyone there again in the near future.",,,,,,,,B P,Other,2021-05-19,"Dear itsmeharrisond,

Welcome to the extended Hollywood Roosevelt family.  We were delighted to have you join us and reading your review left our team smiling from ear to ear.  The comments shared do a wonderful job in summarizing the spirit of our hotel, as we strive to embody hospitality and treat every guest like a lifelong friend.  

We will be sure to let Leila and her colleagues know of your wonderful feedback and on behalf of all of us, we encourage you to be in touch if we can assist in planning another Los Angeles visit.  Until then.

Alana_Montano,8,"Los Angeles, California",2021-02-28,COUPLES,2021-05-15,5,Truly where dreams come true,"Okay, I must start by saying this review is going to be quite long but it’s also long overdue. Our experience Feb. 10th, 2021 was nothing short of incredible. Picture if you will, years ago two hapless 15 year old teens wandering around Hollywood Blvd, staring at the iconic Roosevelt in complete awe and disbelief, declaring one day we will stay here and making it a pact. Saying “Oh wouldn’t it be amazing to stay here and get to tour the whole place top to bottom, to see every storied room I’ve always dreamed of seeing, but for now google images are all I’ve got. One day though.” I’ve always been an avid lover of all things Old Hollywood, so I definitely knew since I was a kid about the extreme  significance this place holds. Every once in a while we’d creep in through the entrance on Hollywood Blvd, just to get a peek at the majestic lobby and just to walk through it was always a treat to tie me over for a couple of weeks, giving me a warm and fuzzy feeling. Ah, to be 15 again. Fast forward 10 years and those two teens become a couple, and on the eve of our first anniversary, we make good on that promise. We booked a room in the tower at the Roosevelt, it was finally happening, we were finally there to stay, even if it was just for a night. I was soaring high. We arrive and check in was nothing short of a warm welcoming experience, if it weren’t for having to wear a mask I think I would’ve freaked out the front desk because my jaw was almost touching the floor. How do you describe being starstruck over an actual place and not a person? In my mind, I had arrived, this was it baby you’re here at last! I curiously (although most likely ignorantly) ask the front desk if it would be alright if I wander around and take some pictures, being a nerdy history buff I really wanted to soak in as much as I could and take it all in. With a warm smile the woman at the front desk said, “That’s more than alright, be sure to check out the lobby from the mezzanine level as well, beautiful view into the lobby. The pool is also down the hall behind you exiting into the garden.” I was geeked. To receive the room key and to be actually walking to the elevators up to our room was a surreal experience in and of itself. As I previously stated, we had arrived. The historic Spanish tiles making a beautiful clicking sound under each step of my sandals, the arches and pictures of all the giants and greats who made this town lining the hallways were further affirmation that the moment I’ve been dreaming of was here. We went up to our room on the 11th floor, took a few minutes to admire the beauty and simplicity (and the bath amenities, I mean Replica Maison Margiela toiletries? Wow!) We left our bags and I was off to do some exploring. After going back down to the lobby, I roamed it top to bottom for the better part of an hour. Curiously wondered why the fountain I remembered for years was missing, but came to the conclusion the hotel knows what they’re doing. Walked down the famous steps where I’ve always read that Shirley Temple was taught a tap dance by the great Bill Bojangles, and instantly recognized a giant wooden framed mirror on the halfway landing, was it, could it be the same mirror that was in Marilyn Monroe’s room? Later that evening I received confirmation that it was indeed that same mirror, points for you I thought, you know your stuff! Dragging my boyfriend along, sounding like an encyclopedia I’m sure going on and on about architecture and names like Errol Flynn and L.B. Mayer, we continue our little self guided tour around the halls and mezzanine and then finally out to the gardens and the pool. I knew the significance of the pool and surrounding area was equally important as the hotel itself, having been the literal birthplace of my idol’s career, Miss Marilyn Monroe’s first photo shoot among many other significant  Hollywood moments. I wander over to where the famed diving board used to be and needed a minute. Okay more than a minute, I was amazed and fangirling to be standing in the same spot where it all started. After that we wandered around the pool and lobby some more, because Lord knows I couldn’t get enough, until concluding that we had seen all that was going to be available for us to see, we head back to our room to shower and get ready for a night on the town. Dinner and drinks were in order, after all two childhood best friends are celebrating their first anniversary as a couple and we were already culminating one of our lifelong dreams. We head out for a few hours, and after a few drinks at a bar a couple of blocks away from the hotel, we realized the time and were ready to head back to our room and get some rest. Strolling west down Hollywood Boulevard though, I couldn’t help this little nagging in the back of my head that I knew there was so so much more to see at the Roosevelt than what I had explored, Marilyn Monroe’s suite and home for 2 years, the Gable and Lombard penthouse, and Blossom room (birthplace to the Academy Awards) instantly came to mind. I chucked it up to wishful thinking, and concluded that if were to ever see those rooms it would be during different stays if ever granted the opportunity to rent them. Still, the 15 year old girl in me persisted that a tour of it all at once would’ve been one of my greatest joys but more likely than not, unprobable. Once arriving back at the hotel I convinced my boyfriend to at least lead me on another stroll of the hallways and lobbies (“yes I know we’ve already seen them babe and yes I know it’s almost 1 am, but I can’t shake the feeling that we’re somewhere too grand to just pack it up and go to bed.”) Wanting to keep me content and knowing the slight disappointment I was feeling from not seeing every historic room I wanted, he obliged. And much to our luck, or fate, or both. As soon as we started wandering the hall beside the front desk, barely passing the elevators we were about to take back up to our room, we run into a friendly sounding man with a group of 3 behind him. He greeted us with sincerity and says,” Hello there, doing some late night exploring ?” I instantly go into nerd mode and explain that the Hollywood history fanatic in me is trying to take in as much as I can after fighting this funny little slighted feeling that I knew I wasn’t going to be able to see every room I truly wanted to see. To my surprise he replies, “Well this must be your lucky night because I’m actually giving my coworker a tour of all the historically important rooms he has yet to learn about, would you care to join us? I’m Bill, the head of security here at the hotel and I’ll be able to take you to all the rooms you’re curious about that you wouldn’t normally get to see otherwise, unless of course you’re renting them.” Would. I. Like. To, HELL YES!!!! Call it fate, call it being at the right place at the right time, call it what you want but after he spoke those magical words I couldn’t help but see that man with a halo above his head for the remainder of the evening. After a slight Q and A he saw I indeed knew my stuff and lead the way, first stop the famed Blossom Room. He unlocked those majestic wooden doors and lead our small group of 5 inside. An instant chill came down my spine, I knew exactly what this place meant. Titans of industry and immortalized faces on the silver screen, all accepted the very first Acadamy Awards in this same room. After debunking some ghost stories and adding to others, he proceeded our tour with the now closed but famed nightclub Teddy’s, and then the historic Spare room, legendary bowling alley and I was amazed and appreciative that it looked virtually the same I’m sure as when their doors first opened in 1927. Thinking that was going to be all, Bill added some extra razzle dazzle and said,” Now let’s go check out the penthouse, shall we?” It was like this man read my mind and knew every room I wanted to see and was going above and beyond to make the 15 year old girl in me’s dream come to fruition. Leading the way back to the lobby and up the elevator, we arrived at the 12th floor, the revered Gable and Lombard penthouse. Here we were, in this grand space where countless who’s who of the town had graced it’s presence for decades since the beginning of moviedom. It held a lot of it’s 1920’s magic and charm with a few modernizations throughout. Gable, Lombard, Dietrich, Chaplin, Mayer, Zanuck. You name them, they’ve been here and slept here. He showed us through the whole 3 story loft and divulged some thoughtful pieces of knowledge he knew we’d appreciate along the way. Then after slinking up a very 1920’s staircase on the 3rd level of the penthouse it exited onto the rooftop terrace. There it was, the red glowing Hollywood Roosevelt sign was right in front of me. Surreal affirmation that we were finally here indeed, in for the experience of a lifetime. Mr. Bill was even kind enough to snap some pictures of me and my boyfriend in front of the glowing sign, a memento to hold on to as proof of the night he made our dream come true. After that he led us to another not so known but equally important penthouse, the Johnny Grant suite. 2 penthouses? Mr. Grant lived here?! I was amazed to not have known that. Indeed, the honorary mayor of Hollywood resided there and just as he had expressed to the Los Angeles times, he wished to take his last breath there. I find it beautiful and noble that the Hollywood Roosevelt saw to it to honor Mr. Grant’s wish, and after a long successful life he did just that, passed peacefully in the place he felt most at home. My admiration for this special place grew even further if that was at all possible. After standing on the southern rooftop terrace of the Grant suite, Bill pointed out cool spots with the best views to stand watch over the Hockney painted pool from far above. After a few minutes basking in the ambience we made our way out of the suite and to the elevators back down to the lobby, what was surely going to be the conclusion of the tour. Still, the curious child in me thought although appreciative of everything we were graced to see, what about my idol’s room? I asked Bill if it would at all be possible to see Marilyn’s suite. Showing his good hearted nature of truly wanting to complete the tour I’ve dreamed of and wanting to go above and beyond to please, Mr. Bill inquired at the front desk if anyone was occupying the suite. To our extreme luck, no one was so access, granted. He led the way out to the garden and upstairs to the second story cabanas. Down a short hallway, door on the left and there we were. Before unlocking it he smiled over at me and asked if I was ready to see, I couldn’t bring myself to speak so I just shakily nodded yes. He opened the door, turned on the lights and led us inside. It took everything in me to try to contain myself but I just couldn’t. Oh if only these walls could talk I thought. He allowed us to show ourselves around and I was in complete awe and disbelief once again. The beautiful white padded walls surrounding the bed, the simplicity and elegance of the living room and bathroom, the balcony overlooking the pool. This was where Marilyn called home where during the uncertainty achieving fame didn’t overcome the desire to be wonderful. And that she was. Just as wonderful as the place that allowed her to call home because they believed in her. I’ve always said that no Hollywood Roosevelt, no Marilyn Monroe. They go hand in hand and I’ll gladly debate anyone who thinks otherwise. After shedding a tear, Bill understood the significance of what being here and everything he showed us meant to me. And it STILL wasn’t over. After leaving Marilyn’s suite (even though I was sure I was going to have to be dragged out kicking and screaming) he still had a few tricks up his sleeve. He led us back out to the garden, around the rear of the cabana buildings and down a sloped ramp to a secret hallway. Instantly we were greeted by black and white trippy cartoon like paintings from floor to ceiling, it felt like being in Alice in Wonderland. He shared that one of these doors contained the tattoo studio of the famed Dr. Woo, Studio X and we respected his privacy and didn’t get to peek in. But he did continue leading us down the hall all the way to the end and unlocked a door containing a giant red velvet room. Inside was a stage, a few electric guitars and other instruments and Bill informed us that in this very room many many a great musicians would come and rock out, everyone from The Rolling Stones to Prince and Marilyn Manson. Some before performing headliners at the Hollywood Bowl, others for an album release party and etcetera. Now this was something that definitely peaked my boyfriend’s interest, see Bill had a little something for everybody. We only imagined the ragers that went on in here, one day we’ll be back to party with the rock stars. After all was said and done, we concluded our tour back outside by the pool and to our surprise it was after 3 am, and I had did the whole trek up and down and all around in high heels no less! I didn’t care one bit, my screaming feet the next day were well worth it.  After the realization of everything I had seen finally hit me, I couldn’t contain myself and burst out crying (again) , truly thanking Bill for everything he was kind enough to share with us. And I expressed that although it may seem trivial to him because he gets to see it everyday, he once again understood the importance and appreciated the sentiment all the same, seeming a little emotional himself after all I’d expressed, and sharing the thought that tours like this don’t usually happen no matter how much people ask. It was like I was walking around in a daydream, although late at night and the place was lonelier because COVID-19 hit, it was just fine with us because we truly felt we had the whole place all to ourselves, and maybe if it weren’t for COVID-19 those same rooms I’d been dreaming of seeing would’ve definitely been booked and unable to see. Blessings in disguise. It’s not everyday that you get the experience of a lifetime, but once again I have to express that I’ll be grateful to Bill for as long as there’s breath in my body. A truly honorable and amazing man through and through. Thank you again Bill, for making a 15 year old girl’s dream come true at 25, for giving us such an incredible experience we’ll never forget, for making an impossible wish come to life, and for making our first anniversary one that is going to be very hard to top (unless we come back) you are truly the Roosevelt’s secret gem. This was an experience I’ll remember for as long as I’ll live, and I’ll continue to come back over and over. I truly wish to get married here one day, and in the words of Johnny Grant hopefully one day take my last breath here. After all, isn’t Hollywood where dreams come true? The Hollywood Roosevelt is just that.",,,,,,,,B P,Other,2021-05-19,"Dear Alana_Montano,

What a review!  We enjoyed reading every word and we thank you allowing us to host your first anniversary retreat.  

While we know our hotel is host to a great deal of Hollywood history, it is really stories like those highlighting the generous spirit of Bill which we hope are long remembered.  While Security Officers are not often seen, we are elated to read that you had the good fortune to bump into Bill and that he made you feel just as welcome as you would expect from our Front Desk or Concierge team members.  Your feedback has already been celebrated with him and throughout the entire hotel and on behalf of all of us, we thank you once more. 

We know we may be jumping ahead just a bit, but when we hear the word “wedding” we can’t help but get excited.  Our hotel is known for turning dreams into visions and we invite you to keep that in mind when the time comes.  Until then, we celebrate your ten years of friendship and your first year as a couple.  We thank you for spending such a special evening with us and we wish you both endless years of health, happiness, and love.

All the best,

C&C,5,,2021-04-30,NONE,2021-04-04,5,A perfect COVID-safe staycation,"I normally don't write reviews, but my husband and I were super impressed with our weekend here. The staff, the vibe, the COVID safety measures....all top-notch. 

THE ROOMS: We got a loft suite, and it's the perfect size. Stylish, clean, tasteful. Top shelf toiletries. Only drawback: The bathrooms are TINY.

THE FOOD: Limited menu across the hotel, but everything was tasty. Room service is available. In common spaces you can scan a QR code at your table or lounger and they'll bring you anything. 

THE POOL: Such a scene! Pool is a perfect temperature. Lots of fun lounge music. So much people-watching.

SERVICE AND STAFF: The best. Everything went so smoothly. Quick check in, room service was prompt. Everyone was super nice. We always felt welcome.

TWO BIG SHOUT-OUTS: 
- Our concierge Mollie for having a chilled bottle of champagne in our room when we arrived.
- The two pool hostesses are legit amazing. They have the hardest job at the hotel and they do it with a smile. They deserve ALL the praise.

TIPS: 
-  Don't book anything smaller than a Loft Suite if you're staying in the tower. 
-  They'll text you a link to do a pre check in. Use it to buy discounted credits for food and late check out with it.
- You can't reserve a lounger at the pool and space is limited, so get there early. There’s also a three hour time limit.  HOWEVER....there are seating areas in the far end by the bocce ball court that are open to anyone, and it was legit better than anything closer to the pool.",,,5.0,,,4.0,5.0,B P,Other,2021-04-05,"Dear candcLA,

We thank you both for joining us and we appreciate you taking the time to share your thorough and thoughtful review.

Max,1,"San Francisco, California",2021-03-31,NONE,2021-03-30,1,"Beautiful Property, Terrible Service!","I booked a room at The Hollywood Roosevelt for my birthday this month because my friends told me good things about the hotel from their past experiences. Upon arriving at the hotel, I was looking to upgrade my room for this special weekend to have a memorable experience with my friends. While this should have been a seamless process, the front desk agent wasn't properly trained, making my check-in experience take over 45 mins. Upon being notified that there was a $150 incidental hold per room/night, I asked the front desk agent if it would be possible to charge that rate once per night since I upgrade to a two-bedroom suite spending an extra $1000 over my three-night stay. In response, I was snapped at by the check-in clerk telling me no, it won't be possible. I then asked him if he would ask his manager, and he was hesitant at first, giving myself and my other friend a much-unneeded attitude. A few minutes later, one of the front desk managers exemplified that same poor attitude asking me (the customer) if there was a problem and being very rude about the whole situation. Wanting to get into my room after a long day of flying, I let the entire case go as I didn't want to start my trip on the wrong note. 

On day 2 of my trip, I called down to the housekeeping department, asking someone to come freshen up our rooms since they hadn't been serviced since we checked in. I was told that they would not service our rooms due to COVID concerns, but we could put all our dirty towels in a bag and leave it outside. I was confused by this as it was never communicated at check-in or by anyone about the current procedures. Wanting to understand more, I asked to speak to a manager. After 30 minutes of having to call back multiple times, I finally got connected to the Director of Housekeeping, Rebecca Jimenez. While speaking with Rebecca, she too exemplified a piss poor attitude over the phone, berating me, saying that I should understand the situation because I'm an essential worker. Being someone who's worked in hospitality for over eight years, I understand the unprecedented times we're in right now and understand the current procedures in place. Still, I don't have the patience for the lack of communication across departments or how I got spoken to. While trying to get an answer from Rebecca of why this wasn't communicated, all she could keep saying was that ""I'm an essential worker"" and  ""I should understand."" A simple response of ""I apologize this wasn't communicated, and I will follow up with the front desk team"" would have been sufficient. Instead, she threatened to cancel my entire reservation. After this happened, I was pretty appalled by what I had just experienced during my birthday weekend. Like the situation at the front desk, I didn't push the issue because I wasn't going to let someone who wasn't happy to be working ruin my experience. 

On day 3 of my trip, I get a knock on my suite from someone in housekeeping asking if I would like my room serviced. At this point, I was shocked as I was berated the day before for just asking someone to pick up our used towels and bring fresh toiletries. Clearly, there are significant communication issues that need to be addressed across departments because this lack of transparency is unacceptable. 

On day 4 of my trip, I checked out of my room and was sitting by the pool before leaving for my flight in a few hours. After sitting in the pool area in peace for over an hour, one of the people working told my friend and me we had to leave since we had already checked out and the pool area was at capacity. This was quite odd to me as there were plenty of open lounge chairs available, all of which were socially distanced to accommodate COVID safety protocols. Having traveled to hundreds of hotels, I have never had an experience like this and hope this is not the standard for how The Hollywood Roosevelt treats their guests.",,1.0,1.0,,5.0,,,B P,Other,2021-03-31,"Dear maximilliancr,

Happy Birthday once again and thank you for joining us for your celebratory retreat.  Our upgraded room types are always worth consideration, and we are delighted to read that you decided to treat yourself to a bit of added luxury.  While we were happy to accommodate that request, the deposit for incidentals would still exist and that authorization is part of the standard check-in system and not something our team can simply override.  We apologize if this was not better explained, and we regret if it resulted in your experience getting off on the wrong foot.  

We appreciate your added feedback, and we are sorry if our pause on daily housekeeping service for stay-over guests was at all a surprise.  Like many hotels, these adjustments to daily operations have been made with the well-being of our guests and colleagues in mind and we regret if this was not clear at the time of your booking.  We have taken great effort to provide transparency on changes at the hotel and our team members should have reviewed these details with you as we were checking you in and welcoming you to the hotel. 

Should your time allow, I would value the opportunity to speak by phone so that I may extend a more personal apology and learn a bit more about your experience for further coaching with our team.  With that in mind, my contact details are provided below which I encourage you to use in forwarding your own information and a suitable time for me to be in touch.  We hope to better impress should we have the chance to welcome you again and I look forward to speaking with you in the days ahead.

It’s a throw back to the Hollywood glam days. We stayed in a cabana close to the famous pool area, close to where Marilyn Monroe lived. You can actually book the cabana suite she lived in while in Hollywood! 
The customer service is excellent. A  special shout out to Mark for making us feel so welcome and for taking time to show us some of the many cool places in the hotel.
Unfortunately, due to covid some of the places were closed so we will definitely be back to enjoy the new restaurant opening up and to see the hotel in its full glory.

Danielle,1,,2021-03-31,FRIENDS,2021-03-21,5,Ghost Hunting at the Roosevelt,"I came with a group of friends and we were anticipating this trip for months. It did not disappoint in fact it exceeded my expectations in every way! We knew this was a haunted hotel and we couldn’t wait to experience it for ourselves. At first we were having problems with our reservation and Kristen was incredibly helpful and accommodating, even giving us an upgraded room right across from one of the most haunted rooms free of charge due to the inconvenience. 

During our stay we were asking specific questions regarding the hauntings Christopher was very helpful in making sure we got the full experience we came for. 

Later that night when we were ready to explore these hauntings Bill was more than happy to give us an exclusive tour. He was very insightful and gave us history behind each area he showed and some paranormal experiences he had encountered. He was very detailed and thorough on his tour and really made it worth the trip. This definitely won’t be our last time here.",,,,,,,,B P,Other,2021-03-23,"Dear danielle_nicole9,

The energy is special from the second you step inside; it’s like entering the old Hollywood glamour era! It’s so beautiful, and the staff is beyond welcoming & accommodating. They anticipate everything you could possibly want beforehand, and the level of service is truly remarkable! My husband and I stayed there this past Valentine’s Day for our 10 year wedding anniversary and it’s hard to fully express how far above & beyond the whole team went to ensure we had the best, most special experience ever! The room was spacious, clean & gorgeous! From the rose petal covered bed, the chocolate strawberries, the champagne, the sweet handwritten personalized note, and a framed photo of my husband & I from years earlier!! (how did they pull that off?!) to the poolside evening movie, the magnificent pool (it’s heated to perfection and was painted by David Hockney himself)! I could go on about this iconic hotel forever. There is NO better way to spend a day in LA then relaxing on their poolside lounges, sipping one of their signature cocktails. They have a great burger restaurant inside the hotel called 25 degrees that has really incredible burgers and their poolside Tropicana menu is also fabulous. (Pro tip—get the calamari, kale salad & sweet potato fries). In case it wasn’t obvious, I could go on about this incredible place forever. Thank you so much Hotel Roosevelt for being a safe, beautiful sanctuary to recharge, rejuvenate and fall back in love. Special shout out to Don, Sergio, Shanna, Andrew, Molly, Dennis, Mo and all the exceptionally kind valet—too many to name, but to everyone that made our anniversary so very special & beautiful, thank you!

TheRenDetroit,7,"Detroit, Michigan",2021-01-31,NONE,2021-01-31,1,Hotel was bought out by a filming production; FORCED me out with less than 24 hours notice!,"This review is going to be a very long and detailed one… but it’s worth the read. 

I was booked to stay at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel from January 19th to the 25th. These six nights were part of my birthday trip. I come to LA every year for my birthday to escape Michigan weather. Being that we are in a pandemic, my entire reason for booking this hotel was to have a nice room to STAY in, to enjoy the view of downtown from my window, and to relax. What happened during the TWO nights I was here was HORRIFYING.

On the day I arrived, I pulled into the somewhat full parking lot and was greeted by the valet. Because we’re in a pandemic, actual valet service was not available (which I prefer anyway, to be honest). The parking lot was unusually full because there was a crew there discussing and planning (for what I was told) a photoshoot to be taking place there during the weekend. Fine by me. I was informed that my car might have to possibly be moved because of the shoot. Again, fine by me.

I went inside to check in. The clerk at the desk was very kind. He informed me about the photoshoot that was going to be happening and that the crew were going to be taking over the pool area. Kind of a bummer, but I could deal with that. The package I purchased for my stay included free self parking, and free breakfast for two each day. The clerk let me know that breakfast wasn’t offered every day, but only on the weekend. I understand that we are in a pandemic, but why would you sell breakfast in a package and then not offer it? He then informed me that I had a $45 per day food allowance. Great! 

The next morning, after I went to pick up coffee from a place on the corner, I stopped at the desk to clarify what that $45 per day was valid for if breakfast wasn’t offered each day. The woman at the desk had absolutely no clue. First she told me breakfast only, then she told me it could be used for lunch or dinner. Which is it? (I never utilized this benefit, in fear that I was being told the wrong information and did not want to be charged extra for room service if the credit wasn’t even valid).

What she said next was something I would never in a million years imagine happening. “Oh by the way, the hotel might be bought out for filming, so we might have to ask you to leave.” I’m sorry… what? There was no clarification. Leave for the day? Leave for good? What is happening?! I went back to my room in complete fear of what was going to happen next. Am I going to be HOMELESS in HOLLYWOOD during a PANDEMIC?!

I immediately reached out to a few of my friends in the filming industry to ask what the typical protocol is for something like this. I got mixed answers. I sat in my room for a few hours, scared to leave. Eventually, I had to go get food. When I arrived back, the same woman at the desk told me that I would have to leave by the next morning. Check out at noon. It was around 4 pm when I was informed I’d have to leave. This is less than 24 hours notice. 

Now, these six nights at this hotel cost me over a grand. I was charged in full plus an incidental hold. Everyone’s finances are different… but I don’t just have another extra grand to throw down on a new hotel. This woman at the desk told me she “didn’t know what to tell me” when I explained that I didn’t have any funds to just book another place. Even after they process a refund for the nights I didn’t stay (which, she told me would only be a refund for three nights… even though my total nights stayed would only be two after this fiasco) those funds do not immediately show up in your account. It takes at least 2-3 days! This woman had absolutely NO empathy, said it wasn’t her fault that she had to be the “bad guy” with the news… etc. She claims to be a “manager” but that was a joke.

Now I’m back in my room, trying to figure out what to do. I called a hotel that I had stayed in on a previous trip to see if they would help me out in a pinch. This hotel is fine, but it doesn’t have a view, doesn’t have as nice of rooms, and isn’t as quiet… Not what I had in mind to spend my remaining four nights. At this point, I had to do what I had to do in order to not be HOMELESS.

I called down to the lobby and got another clerk on the phone, Jay. He at least understood how to politely speak to guests. He must not have gotten word that I was already spoken to, because he gave me the whole speech again about how they were bought out and that I would have to leave. He straight up told me that “times are tough” and said that because of the pandemic, the hotel has to “do what they have to do” for money. He straight up said that my money and my stay means nothing, and that the film production trumps any other guests. APPALLING. He let me know that he would be refunding all but one night’s charges. Great. But there was still no offer to help find accommodations.

Two things should have happened in this situation. First, upon check in, I should have been informed of the production. Second, I should have been asked to find other accommodations BEFORE I even checked in (or, more favorably, other accommodations should have been booked FOR ME, at a similar hotel, in the vicinity, complimentary).

After check out, I received an email with a survey to fill out about my stay. The basis of the response was that he ""would have helped me find other accommodations had he known I needed help""...

Again, HORRIFYING. OF COURSE I made other arrangements! I was afraid of being homeless as this was NOT ORIGINALLY offered to me! I would NEVER give these people another chance! Had they offered a complimentary weekend or something of the sort, maybe I would have given them another chance. But considering how expensive this place is, I would never give them another penny in fear of another situation like this happening. 

This situation ruined an entire day of what was supposed to be a RELAXING birthday trip. If you want to possibly be forced out onto the streets during a pandemic, by all means, book with this hotel. But for better customer service and getting your money’s worth… I would recommend ANYWHERE else!

P.S. The hotel was bought out by T-Mobile. You mean to tell me I couldn’t be in the building while they filmed a phone commercial? Give me a break.",Ask for a room facing the hills AND downtown,,1.0,3.0,,,3.0,B P,Other,2021-02-03,"Dear TheRenDetroit,

Monte W,1,,2020-11-30,NONE,2021-01-01,5,Tinsel town magic,My family traveled to Southern CA over the Thanksgiving holiday.    One of our stops was two nights at the Hollywood Roosevelt.    Although during the pandemic the Hollywood area is not the same with most attractions and movie theaters closed - the Roosevelt was all that we could have asked for.    This historic hotel just radiates the glamor of Hollywood.     We especially enjoyed time relaxing by the palm encircled pool.    Truly the highlight of the stay was one of the evenings where my daughter and I were taking some pictures around the hotel.

Discerning Eric,2,,2020-12-31,NONE,2020-12-17,5,Best Kept Secret in LA,"My friend and I ventured out to the Hollywood Roosevelt for the Rooftop Yoga class offered at 10:30 AM on Saturdays.  The class, led by Mary, was spectacular and aided by a view of the city that must be seen to be believed. 

After class, we strolled around the pristine premises and ordered lunch while sitting by the pool.  The atmosphere was ideal and we were greeted by a pair of highly trained waiters in Maria and Isaac.  The classic 50's soundtrack, delicious appetizers and perfect view kept us for hours.  Ultimately, we needed up staying over thanks to very reasonable room rates, outstanding, friendly service and a dire need for a safe staycation venue during the pandemic.  

The room was delightful, the bed incredibly comfortable.  It made for an incredible, impromptu weekend of yoga, potstickers and kale salad and, a dip in the pool, and much needed R and R.  I highly recommend the Hollywood Roosevelt for a staycation or just to enjoy the afternoon at the local delicious restaurant offerings.

I mean, why would it not be booking a Cabana Suite at a Historic Hotel?  I get we are in COVID-19 times, and particularly in Los Angeles there is a lot of care in how businesses are operating.  I take all that into account as I think about my experience here.  I teeter between 2-3 stars overall.

Let me start by saying when you are paying roughly $700 per night for a room, regardless of size you are expecting overall property top notch service.  I was there with my adult Niece and we were doing a girl time trip.

Valet - Five star... the gentlemen that work out in Valet/Bell were the only outstanding part of our stay.  Super friendly, very accommodating and really made an effort to get to know you.

Front Desk... checking in, the guy who helped us seemed annoyed with us checking in at roughly 2:15PM.  He kept saying check-in was not until 3.  That is fine, but no need to repeat.  He also covered their operating rules - only TWO people allowed in our suite (okay, but other rooms had way more than 2 people), no service unless we requested it, certain common areas closed, etc.  He made a point of stating how clean their rooms are and their website covers how they take that seriously.   I will say that the young man who helped us later  when we got our keys was very friendly and kind.  We dealt with him later and he was always gracious.

Tropicana Bar while we waited for our room to be ready... drinks were delicious (Prickly Pear Margarita is where it's at!) and we had some yummy snacks - Truffle Fries and Cauliflower.  Service was slow as molasses even though there was hardly anyone there (Thursday) at the pool or even at the bar.  For our second round, I watched our drinks sit at the bar for 10 minutes and as I was going to get up to get them myself, a server saw me and brought them over.  They added 18% service gratuity for our bill automatically.  I was fine with that, although after the off-putting guy at the front desk I was starting to question my choice of stay.

Cabana Suite - Room 108 - I go back and forth about this.  The room was spacious and the private patio was super awesome.  It had a private outdoor shower that ended up not working (get your stuff working for people dropping $$$ for these rooms) along with the fireplace that did not work.  Y'all have been open a month at this point right?  The room itself was lovely, although seating was minimal with one stool... one chair and a sofa.  We could not find the remote for the sitting area TV until the next day when we found it under the curtains and we quickly sanitized it.  There was confetti all over the floor in the sitting are as well and the patio so it was clear that the prior guest had a celebration of sorts.  At that point we started worrying about the actual cleanliness of the room if these items had been overlooked.  

On day 2 in the afternoon... I went to grab the ironing board (be mindful it is a table top ironing board) I see this room key cover on the top shelf and think okay yet another housekeeping item overlooked and threw it away.  As I grabbed the ironing board and look down there is a room key and another card with a bunch of white powder substance.  Presumably cocaine or some other drug given the layout (of course we took a pic and I sent to my Hubby who is retired federal law for his thoughts).  We called down for a manager who quickly came up with someone probably from security, then followed by someone who sterilized/cleaned it up.  They were genuinely apologetic, I was conflicted.  How clean was this room really --- and in COVID-19 times no less?  Not to mention the drugs in the room from their prior guest I am guessing given the previously mentioned confetti/under the curtain smudged remote.  They offered to take off my late check out (which I did not even use anyway) and $200 off my bill.  Not impressed, but not worth the confrontation or interaction about something that is pretty disturbing on two fronts.

For a $1400-ish 48 hours experience ... it fell very short.",,,2.0,3.0,4.0,,,,,,,198

David A,4,"Riverside, California",2020-05-31,FAMILY,2020-05-29,5,Amazing Staff,"My family and I took a one day trip to Hollywood.  We chose to stay at the Roosevelt because of its history and legends.  Upon our late arrival, we were treated so well.  The woman behind the front desk was so friendly and welcoming.  It wasn't busy and we chatted for a moment about our fur family and more.  Such a warm welcome.  She made sure we had everything we needed and offered to call the restaurant for a last minute order.  She was truly a gem.

We wanted to check out the hotel a little, but it seemed like a lot of areas were off limits. Feeling a little hungry, we decided to see if there was anything open for a snack.  The man who was working security greeted us and somehow knew our bellies were growling. He pointed us in the right direction for some amazing eats.  When we returned, he was still out there watching everything.  We asked him of the history and legends surrounding the hotel.  He introduced himself as Bill and enlighted us with some information.  He offered to even show us around, which was beyond amazing.  

I have never in my life been treated so well by hotel staff.  Bill was so kind and full of great details, history, knowledge...  you can tell that this gentleman not just loves working at the Roosevelt, he is proud to be part of the Hollywood Roosevelt team.  His enthusiasm shines bright, and his kindness is well beyond measure.  I am truly impressed and so appreciative of the warm and generosity shown to us.  Never, and I mean never, have I had such an amazing experience.  Truly a top notch place.

I sincerely hope that management/owners see what Bill brings to this establishment.  Thank you so much, Bill and the entire staff for being so wonderful to my family during our short stay!  ❤",,,,,,,,,,,,3

made at 6 am.  You have to check your bill everyday because they add food from the honor bar. We never touched the snacks or drinks yet i had $25 added to my

First of all, we had never been to to The Hollywood Roosevelt OR a magic show and we were not disappointed. Once you walk in to the hotel, the lighting and fountain just make the atmosphere so relaxed yet fancy and the employees there were very helpful whenever I needed help finding something.

At the show, the atmosphere got even better. The cushioned seats and lighting (again) made it so comfortable and intimate for me and my partner. The servers were super attentive and I have to say that the drink called  ""Smoke & Mirrors"" was by far the best drink I have ever had and was worth every cent!

Franco Pascali had surprise after surprise (will not go into detail so I don't spoil anything)! I kept finding myself with my jaw dropped and even my boyfriend was able to be part of the show! The magician was so kind enough to have meet and greets after the show and take pics which I enjoyed.

They took us in last time in the middle of the night after a horrible hotel was so bad we had to leave. Let's just say that they made me a life long customer. Fast forward to this past weekend. My fiancee' and I were in Hollywood for our 5th Anniversary. We had a great day in Malibu and Santa Monica and got to the Roosevelt late at 8:30pm. We booked through hotels tonight becuase we wanted the best deal and we were planning on just spending the night but loved the hotel so much it worth staying there. The valet helped us in with our bags and were greeted by Sammy at the front desk. All that was left was a 2 double bedroom which was fine. We were just happy to be there after a wonderful day. Next thing we new she was offering us an upgrade to an amazing pool side king suite for $50 extra for the night. I said that ot was an amazing offer but we wouldn't have time to really  use it to its full advantage. She then said they had one other room. The Penthouse suite! I said you are going to give us the penthouse sweet for $50? She joked around and said how amazing would that be. She then had her manager go check on our room that we booked becuase there had been a lot of switching of guests earlier in the day and they wanted to make sure it was ready for us. Next thing we knew Brandon the manager called down to Sammy. She comes around and tells us the amazing news that we get to have the penthouse suite for $50 for the night. It was simply amazing. 3000 sqft, 2 story, 2 bedroom suite with a private patio area on the roof. When we walked in we almost cried. It was the most amazing stay in such an amazing hotel with so much history. Sammy and Brandon really made a once in a lifetime memory for my fiancee' and I and we will never stay aware again in LA even if it's not the penthouse.

The rooms are tiny, and while remodeled, they basically left the old bones in place and just painted/wallpapered/tiled around it.  I just couldn't get over looking at the door casings - they look original - not because of any craftsmanship, but because of the level of damage and disrepair.  The bathroom was so small, the closet was larger!  And for a hotel - why do you need a walk-in closet when your bathroom is the size of my shoe?

The beds were very uncomfortable - probably original too! Just really shoddy work guys!

While the building is historic and there is some old Hollywood charm - the rooms and living quarters were awful. I wouldn't even stay here for free.  We would have been better to stay at a motel.  We stayed during the holidays and during high season so we paid quite heavily to stay here... not to mention parking.  Very annoyed - 2 months later still irritated.

steve7739,68,"Cheltenham, United Kingdom",2020-02-29,SOLO,2020-02-09,2,Second Class Guest,"This hotel is “historic” by US standards, being the home of the first Academy Awards; the only place that this is of any interest is in the old lobby, which is technically open to the public, although half the time it was off limits as it was either hosting a private event or setting up for one.  Unfortunately the hotel’s age means that the rooms are quite small, bathrooms are tiny, water pressure is poor, air conditioning is very noisy, there are long waits for an inadequate number of elevators, and the pipes creak and bang.  The rooms are also very badly lit so they are completely unsuitable if you need to get any work done during your stay.

The pool - which the hotel markets heavily, and was one of the reasons I booked the hotel, since I had some downtime at the end of my trip - was closed for the entirety of my four day visit as they had rented it out for a private party.  No mention was made of this prior to my arrival, nor on check in.  Only a piece of paper left in the room mentioned this, and an apology for the inconvenience was notably absent.  If you want to use an alternative pool then you have to take a 40 minute (by car) round trip to the Andaz, which is hardly convenient.  The hotel offered to pay for an Uber “if I didn’t want to walk” but I would have to apply to be reimbursed for it after the fact (and upon further enquiry I was told I would have to walk a couple of blocks to get an Uber due to the road closures for the Oscars).  It made me wish I had just booked at the Andaz in the first place.  Even when I enquired politely about this nobody ever offered an apology.  The attitude seems to be that they can make more money from renting out the hotel’s public spaces, so screw the hotel guests that have already paid for them.  I feel this is bait-and-switch and tells you a lot about how management regard their paying hotel guests.  

The lobby was also rented out one night for a private party - and the people there (not sure whether they were the hotel’s own staff or not) were quite rude to me and another couple when we tried to get to the elevators to get to our rooms, as if we were trying to crash their party.  The pool bar was also closed, so there is nowhere in the hotel to just sit and relax.

I deeply regret booking this hotel - it was the most expensive of my trip around the States, and it was so disappointing - so I cannot recommend it to anyone.

They do offer free coffee in the lobby in the mornings.  The only other redeeming feature of the hotel is its location, which would normally be pretty good for the sights of Hollywood (which is actually pretty seedy - but that’s not the hotel’s fault).  However on this occasion the location was more of a curse.  The roads and sidewalks around the hotel were closed because of the Oscars, and I had to haul my suitcase several blocks (dodging homeless people on the streets) to a random street corner in order to get an Uber to the airport.  When I enquired with the front desk about where the best place to get an Uber from was, all I got was shrugged shoulders and a moan that staff couldn’t park near to the hotel.

All in all I was made to feel like a second-class guest who had crashed someone else’s party and who wasn’t welcome. ",,,,,,,,Manager-247,General Manager,2020-02-10,"Dear steve7739,

The bathroom faucet barely had any water pressure. Took a shower and the sensor in bathroom kept on shutting off the light leaving me to shower in the dark. This is dangerous for guests. The room smelled dated, and had poor lighting. I was up at 3 AM due to noise from outside and could not rest. There was no activity offered to guests in lobby. Decided to leave as this is not the Hollywood experience I was looking for. Spoke to management and they refused to provide me with a full 2 night credit on my reservation because it violated their cancellation policy. My response is you have a duty to provide a satisfactory accommodation to your guests. You breached this obligation by providing a substandard room and facility. Please note that the hotel pool was also closed. Will never stay with you again. Folks stay away from this hotel",,,,,,,,Manager-247,General Manager,2020-02-10,"Dear Evepetal,

Great location!","We were hesitant to book the Roosevelt due to location and LA's current ""homeless"" problem.  Having been there before, we decided to go back- and I am so glad we did!  First, if you are going to see sights on Hollywood Blvd, you are not going to avoid the panhandlers or ""homeless"" anyway. Second, if you are going to Hollywood Blvd this location cannot be beat! Right near all the action it provides the BEST location- the history of the hotel adds to it.

What puts the Roosevelt over the top is it's staff. We never had an problem feeling secure despite the busy street and traffic. In fact, the security staff did not hesitate to not only acknowledge you, but shake your hand, and chat with you. (Not to say they were distracted from doing their job, but they weren't a menacing presence either).

The staff was incredible! Friendly and helpful without over doing it!  In fact, on the last day, the restaurant was closed and it was too early for coffee in the lobby. I asked security where to go to get some and with the help of Ross (the Overnight MOD) they got us coffee without an issue! Now that is service!

The hotel is historic and old, but by no way lapsing or lacking in any way. Everything was neat and clean! The room was generous in space- not small at all. (And by no means were we in an expensive room.) The room was in great shape as were the public areas. I travel a lot and some new hotels do not look this good or are this well maintained. They care about this important historic hotel and it's guests!

The Roosevelt is a great place, but the staff makes it so much better! Safe, Secure, Friendly and Home when we are in LA. The Roosevelt has long been a great place and still is today! These people git it and get it spot on!

KMJ,1,"Luzon, Philippines",2020-01-31,COUPLES,2020-01-31,2,Disappointing,"I have absolutely no idea how this hotel is rated so high. Only good thing for us was that people at the valet area were so nice and friendly and took the initiative so assist us. 

Room was okay, bed is clean. But our cabana room felt and looked old. I also found an empty sprite bottle under the bedside upon arrival. Felt like they didnt clean it thoroughly. There was also no free wifi. So we decided to avail of the 3day one for 36usd so we can stream and cast, but it didnt work. We were only then informed that there chromecast wasnt working so we paid for wifi for nothing. No complementary water as well. 

For a hotel on the expensive side, we were so disappointed. Wouldnt recommend. ",,,,,,,,Manager-247,General Manager,2020-01-31,"Dear RKMD,

Robfelix,1,"Los Angeles, California",2020-01-31,NONE,2020-01-28,5,Amazing Hotel and staff!!,"I stayed at the Hollywood Roosevelt on a trip to LA to start the year and had an amazing time! The hotel has an old school Hollywood vibe that I absolutely loved! Walking through the the lobby felt like a flashback to the 1950’s but the hotel is also modern enough that it had everything I needed, plus the view from our room was awesome. Lounging at the Tropicana bar by the pool was super chill too. The thing that really stood out to me was the staff, everywhere we went everyone was super nice and helpful. My lady and I wanted to go out but we didn’t really know exactly where. We wound up asking some random security guy named Bill if he had any recommendations and he turned out to be awesome! We told him we wanted to go out but didn’t wanna go somewhere too touristy. He recommended a Cuban bar on the other side of Hollywood name La Descarga and it was awesome. They had a burlesque show with a live band and cigar room with rum tastings. He even told us which taco truck to go to after across the street and we ended up eating the best Tortas we’ve ever had. The hotel location was perfect, we were able to get to Runyon canyon easily for a hike where we saw some of the best views of the city and were even able to walk to in n out from the hotel after. Luckily we ended up running into Bill again our second night and he was nice enough to give us a tour of the hotel and explain some of the history of the place which was dope. Overall we had a great experience at the Roosevelt and definitely plan on coming back this summer to hit the pool parties!",,,5.0,,5.0,5.0,,Manager-247,General Manager,2020-01-29,"Dear Robfelix10,

We stayed at the Hollywood Roosevelt because a friend recommended it for location and beauty of hotel. I was pleasantly surprised.

She followed up with an email with links and details. 
When we checked in we walked thru the hotel and the employees said “welcome to the Roosevelt “ with a smile. We loved our room, character and a great vacation oto was in iew of the theatre. The rooms were quiets and beds were comfy. I forgot my toothbrush and the brought one up to me before bed. 
We loved hanging out at the pool and during the Paramount and the Prickly Pear Coloda while  eating amazing appetizers.  The ambiance with the lights, palm tree and pool is amazing!!!!!

Ordered a steak for dinner and it was horrible.  The first one was more than over done so a second one was sent.  The second was not much better but the kicker was they both came placed on top of  a plate of french fries. Not a good presentation. This is suppose to be a preffered hotel.   The meal was not great to say the least.  A complete waste of money and when i mentioned it to the front desk they chuckled as i walked away.

There is a classic lobby which embodied the great architecture. Check in was very good. When Henry asked what brought us in and we mentioned a special day he insisted in sending us a bottle of champagne!!! This was much appreciated and really added to our stay.

The room had a very comfortable, contemporary decor. Bed was great, bathroom was beautiful. The balcony had a cafe table and chairs which we used. The pool area was beautiful.

Sandsmouse,41,,2019-12-31,NONE,2020-01-15,4,Mixed Review this time,"Not sure where to start with this as it is the 3rd time we have stopped at this hotel but there was a difference this time .
Lets start with the positives ...... very nice historical hotel in an excellent location on Hollywood Boulevard .Cant get better than that .Very impressive .
Checking in was easy - had to wait for the room but was on the highest floor and overlooking part of the Boulavard as promised so no complaints .Baggage was stored Nice friendly check in staff.Nice room .Comfy bed .
Amazing pool - food a little expensive but again ...location ...location ...history ...location ..
Now the not so positives ...air conditioning was not working right or putting out heat This was addressed and soon it was heating up the room BUT it remained really noisy when turned on so we only used it for short periods at a time 
By coincidence my partner is an Air Conditioning Engineer and he thought that the filters were all blocked up and there had probably been a set point for the heating programmed in that was maybe then just readjusted to make it higher ,because there were days that were colder when we were there and we needed the heating .Not sure?I know we could have had another room but it was a nice room and it would have meant packing up everything again to move .
Toiletries ...these were not replenished daily ...even when empty bottles were clearly left out or in the bin !! We were only there 4 days and not once were more left for us to use .Yes I know we could have complained .......but we shouldnt have to .It seems such a small thing but it makes the difference between a good hotel and an excellent one .It didn't seem worth complaining for the time we were there ...and we made sure by the 2nd day that empty bottles were clearly visible .
It just felt on this stay that things were being a little neglected and for the prices that shouldnt be .Its more than the cost ...its the history and the reputation and the experience 
Yes we will go back ...but I really hope that little things like this that make a difference can be sorted out .Just a simple check on the room beforehand would have thrown up the difficulty with a very nosiy air conditioning unit 
It really is the difference between a 4 and 5 star hotel",Ask for a high room (12th floor if possible ) and overlooking Hollywood Boulevard,,2.0,5.0,,3.0,,Manager-247,General Manager,2020-01-16,"Dear Sandsmouse,

Location: You can’t be more central! It’s literally on Hollywood Boulevard. Opposite the Chinese theatre, wax museum, Hollywood stars. 15 minutes to the Griffith Observatory, 30-40 minutes to Santa Monica (depending on traffic.). 10 mins to Universal studios (we took Lyft when we went as it worked out cheaper rather than paying parking at the park!) Shopping just outside the hotel, theres CVC (pharmacy and you can also get groceries), Coffee bean cafe, and so much more! The choice is limitless!

Room: The room we had was huge (even our friends who was travelling with us, there room was awesome!) We were on the 7th floor overlooking the pool. We had amazing sunrise every morning. Our room also overlooked the whole of LA and when the clock striked midnight in New Ears eve, we were able to watch the fireworks going on the whole city!

We are a family of 4, and our room had two double beds, closet... and the shower...OMG... we all fitted in with enough room!! It was amazing! Our room was cleaned every day.

Staff: So friendly and so helpful! They were also so patient and took to all our requests every time! One of the staff gave us a brief history of the hotel, which was very interesting..

Hotel: The hotel itself is so beautiful, especially when it was decorated with all the Christmas decorations. It carries a lot of history: Marilyn Monroe’s suite where she stayed all the time, the hall where the first Oscars were held, etc. The pool is heated and the kids managed to swim. We couldn’t get them out! There’s tea and coffee available in the reception area until 9am. We used to grab coffee in the morning and go to the pool area and soaked in the morning sunshine and air. What a way to start the day! We also had breakfast at the Tropicana bar! Be warned portions are huge! Very clean, lots of security. You can also just chill out in the lobby.

There’s also the 25 restaurant that’s open 24 hours. We didn’t manage to try it but heard good things!

We used valet during our stay. It was quite steep at $45 a day but having done all our research, it was the same in all other parking lots. Plus so much easier and convenient with the kids. So do expect to pay that much.

We requested to go the rooftop and they were able to take us there via the penthouse...What  a view! 

We really felt like celebrities during our stay and couldn’t be happier! All staff made us feel so welcome and fulfilled all our request. We used to sit in the lobby and by the poolside and we just soaked in the atmosphere and the history of the hotel...

So came back with my family this time and chose a different room. My first stay was in one overseeing the walk of fame so I wanted something more quiet with my family. The rooms on the other side have a better view of downtown LA so woke up to beautiful views of sunrise on LA skyline. The room was great and spacious with a separate area for our bags (4 of them) which allowed us to walk around in the room without tripping over luggage. The roll-away bed is comfortable (queen size) and the dining options are great for a family especially if jet-lagged with the 25 degrees diner open 24 hrs and the tropicana offering a great service and decent prices for breakfast. Bellmen and housekeeping are great but front desk can do an effort on customer service and decreasing the level of arrogance. They were better last time around.

Cara R,11,,2020-01-31,FAMILY,2020-01-02,2,Big Disappointment!!!,Chose this hotel based on its location and history. Could not have been a bigger disappointment.  Sure it had some cool history/background and hosts some glamourous events. They obviously live off of that reputation.  The rooms are dumps—filthy and outdated. Our window was so dirty you couldn’t even see out of it. The bathroom was teeny tiny and old. The beds are doubles—who has a double bed in this day and age? The front desk staff were completely apathetic. The security guard in the lobby glared at my kids the whole as if they shouldn’t be there. Truthfully we couldn’t check our fast enough. ,,,,,,,,Manager-247,General Manager,2020-01-03,"Dear CaraR261,

Lucy_1,213,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",2019-08-31,COUPLES,2019-12-31,2,Disappointment ,"When my husband and I planned our California trip for his 40th birthday we wanted to include only the best, iconic places, with charm & some history. Thought The Roosevelt hotel should be included so we've booked for our last 2 nights at the end of our long vacation. 
Unfortunately it was a mistake. Although the interiors of the Roosevelt hotel are charming, you can walk in, have a look around and leave - that's my recommendation. Staying there was unnecessary and unpleasant. 
Our room was on the 2nd floor, facing the pool and the wild pool party. First night I didn't sleep until 2am as the music was so loud. For the second night we've requested to be moved to the Tower, higher and further away from the noise so I could get some sleep before our 16h flight... On the last day after the checkout, we were still relaxing for an hour by the swimming pool and asked the reception regarding the changing/shower facilities and were told they don't exist... in general the staff is unhelpful and doesn't provide any customer service care. It is low to me & disappointing. Definitely doesn't match the 5 star rating. 
Luckily it were only 2 nights, wouldn't stay longer or ever again, wouldn't recommend to others either. 
From what I have seen it's a hotel for a wild pool party that's all not to stay and have a good time. ",,,,,,,,Manager-247,General Manager,2020-01-02,"Dear imlucy_1,

We had stayed at this hotel many years ago, and even though it isn’t as ‘hip’ as it used to be, service and amenities were nice!  We were used to a little bit bigger room, and as we were checking in a guest came down to ask for a bigger room, so next time if and when we stay there I would be tempted to do the same!  It is also very close to some of the Hollywood attractions if that’s what you’re there for!

Benjamin R,4,,2019-12-31,FAMILY,2019-12-27,5,Mere words cannot capture this experience!,"What started as a day trip to surrounding LA, ended in an unexpected journey through the depths of its rich history. 

My family and I were exploring Hollywood Blvd and before we knew it, midnight was upon us. The 2 hour drive back to San Diego felt more than daunting...

As we ventured forth through the bright lights, landmarks of our most celebrated stars, and the now closing shops, the Hollywood Roosevelt caught my eye.

The towering estate called to me and my exhausted family, and after a few clicks and credit card # later, our rooms were booked.

My youngest daughter was more than excited for our stay, she had read stories of the hauntings of The Roosevelt online, and my once tired teen was now hyper vigilant.

Entrance into the lobby level... I'm almost embarrassed to try and articulate the sight with written word. Have you ever walked into a building, and more than just see with your eyes, you feel the ambience with body and soul?

The interior was breathtakingly spectacular, it felt as if we had walked down the red carpet ourselves. Immersed in its historic architecture and beauty.

After a brief stint at the counter we were on the elevator to our room. Spacious and quaint, I rested my weary body but for a moment... My daughter sat by starryeyed and expressed her wish to explore the hotel.

We made our way back to the lobby, and began to wander about when were greeted by head of security Mr. Bill Paz... this chance encounter would be the highlight of our week long stay!

Mr. Bill was beyond friendly and engaging, and after our introduction asked if we had any questions about the Hotel. This is where my teenager unloaded her internet aquired wealth of knowledge.

Mr. Bill was more than happy to answer her questions, and stated that he was headed out to patrol the premises, he extended an invitation to join him.

What started as a friendly conversation, began a personally guided tour of one of the Nations most iconic hotels in history.

Mr. Bill's friendly demeanor, wealth of knowledge about the Hotel and its lore, and willingness to include my family during his rounds made a routine stay anything but...

As he kept a keen eye on the goings on of the busy night life, he shared with us his 
personal stories of his 12 years on duty. I myself was star stuck, hanging on his words and deeply engaged in both his storytelling and the majestic wonders the hotel had to offer.

A simple thank you would not do justice too the experience Mr. Bill shared with my family and I. A chance meeting during a spontaneous day trip, will forever be etched into our memories. Priceless is the word I will use to embody our stay at The Hollywood Roosevelt.

Thank you Mr. Bill Paz, for making our trip to Hollywood a once and a lifetime opportunity!",,,,,,,,Manager-247,General Manager,2019-12-27,"Greetings  T3910TWbenjaminr,

Leanne R,79,"Sale, United Kingdom",2019-12-31,COUPLES,2019-12-27,3,So so ,"We stayed here for 4 nights as part of a trip to Vegas, LA and New York. 
Unfortunately the hotel did not wow us. Check in was swift however when we arrived the only room ready was one with a frosted window so we wouldn’t be able to see out. We were given the option to wait for a different room which we chose to do and we were told that we would be called when it was ready and they would ask housekeeping to clean as a priority. After waiting about 4 hours we still hadn’t heard anything so asked again at the desk to find that the room was ready and no one had contacted us.
The view from the room was nice and we could see the Hollywood sign and the Chinese theatre however the rooms are very dark. I understand it is an old hotel and they are trying to maintain the old Hollywood feel however it did make it difficult when trying to do make up for example 
The pool area was lovely and we enjoyed sitting and having a drink by the pool 
The main lobby is very glam and the historic Hollywood vibe has been maintained. There was a private party on it the lobby one evening meaning we could not walk through and we got hearded off down what felt like a back corridor to get
To our rooms. Not what I would expect as a paying guest. 
We had a problem with our room key card which wouldn’t work meaning we had to get someone to let us in our room every time which was very inconvenient. The desk kept providing us with replacement cards and after 10 cards! (Yes 10) we were told that they were replacing all the door locks to digital locks and were working there way down by floors. As we were having so many problems with ours they said that they would ask for ours to be replaced the following morning but this never happened. I would have expected this to be done or to be offered a different room but this did not happen

It is a shame that the service let this hotel down and unfortunately we would not return ",,,,,,,,Manager-247,General Manager,2019-12-27,"Dear leanner996,

PassionwithPurpose,979,"Los Angeles, California",2019-12-31,COUPLES,2019-12-21,4,Iconic Hollywood hotel ,"If you have never stayed at this hotel, you need to stay at least once, just to say you did. It is the quintessential old Hollywood glam hotel. The pool scene is especially fun during the summer!

If you have never stayed in LA before and you are thinking of staying here, you need to know what you are in for. This is probably the most touristy and one of the more crowded areas in Los Angeles as it is across the street from the old Grauman’s Chinese theater and Madam Tussauds wax museum. 

The area is a little seedy and definitely dirtier than other parts of LA, though you can see the Hollywood sign from many of the rooms in this hotel. The Magic Castle and many other landmarks are also a short walk away.

We opted for a one-bedroom suite, which was quite spacious although a little dated. The room itself is comfortable with a smaller bathroom. The shower did not have very good water pressure and the bathroom felt a little cramped.

The bed and the pillows were both quite comfortable. Be prepared that there are no modern amenities/frills such as USB plugs next to the bed or automated lights. 

The room does not have a coffee machine, but if you ask at the front desk, they can send you a Keurig machine up. 

The staff are very friendly and helpful, and overall it is a decent hotel so long as you know what you are in for.

If you are looking for a night out on the town in Hollywood, this is a fun, old-school hotel to definitely check out.

If you are looking for something a little more upscale, I would recommend staying in West Hollywood, Beverly Hills or Santa Monica instead.",,,,,,,,Manager-247,General Manager,2019-12-23,"Dear passionwithpurpose,

Jo R,10,"Gippsland, Australia",2019-12-31,COUPLES,2019-12-18,1,A series of unfortunate events.,"We stayed 6 nights at the Hollywood Roosevelt. We arrived early from our long flight and would have liked an early check-in which we would have happily paid for. The computer system was down so we went for a sightsee to come back - still down. We were extremely tired but they were unable to give us a room. One would have thought they could have looked at our paper booking to see that we had indeed booked a room through our travel agent and given us any room temporarily, but no, this was too difficult. We ended up ""camping"" on the lobby couch until 3pm check-in came around THEN they had to do manual checkins anyway. Made it to our room only to be woken at midnight by a very violent fight in the next room. We were given a room with connecting doors and I was terrified. Management escorted the offenders from the hotel but then the cleaners arrived just after and made so much noise that we were kept awake for another hour or so. We were assured the next morning that new people were now in the room.
A few nights later, at 11.30 pm, it was party night in the room next door. We asked to move but instead security came up and asked the neighbours to quieten down which they did for 10 minutes. The noise continued so we again asked to move. The front desk lady said that""those rooms are a bit noisy because its the party area"" I wish they had told us that from the beginning! So we got dressed, packed up after midnight and moved to a ""quieter"" room. We arrived here, unpacked,  got into bed and then the air conditioner started up. It was like a jet engine roaring. They sent up the engineer who said it was a problem next door and he'd fixed it. When he left it started again. Again, we moved rooms. By this time it was 2am. This room was at least quiet and we had 2 peaceful nights. Whist the  staff were very polite, I  couldn't help but get the feeling that they thought we were just whinging. 
It was really a series of mishaps which we were unfortunate enough to encounter. Would we stay at the Hollywood Roosevelt again?? Mmm?? I think not!",,,,,,,,Manager-247,General Manager,2019-12-19,"Dear 38jor,

Sausagedog97,35,"Kent, United Kingdom",2019-12-31,FRIENDS,2019-12-15,3,Average hotel,"We stayed in the Hollywood Roosevelt for 3 nights last week. We arrived quite late and on arrival the receptionist was very welcoming and friendly. The doormen also helped us with our luggage. I couldn’t fault the staff, they were always smiling and friendly. Our room was lovely and clean on arrival, however the housekeeping team did not visit our room once during our stay. We were out during the day during our stays so there is no excuse as to why the housekeepers couldn’t come into our room. We found that our room keys rarely worked. We had to keep going back down to reception which I can see is a familiar theme in other reviews. At one point there was us and 4 other guests in the corridor all stood outside our rooms trying to get in. We were on the 3rd floor and found it to be really noisy, ? Whether this was the ice machine in the corridor. The hotel is decorated well, we really liked Teddy’s bar. The cocktails were nice and again the staff were friendly. I unfortunately wouldn’t come back to L.A. Whilst the following isn’t relevant to the hotel I feel my experience may help other travellers. I didn’t feel safe in Hollywood or near by to the hotel. Unfortunately, there is a lot of homeless people who can be quite intimidating. We walked out of the hotel one morning to see two men in tents right near to the hotel on sunset boulevard. Whilst I understand this can’t be helped, it made us anxious as they were asking for money in quite an aggressive manner. When you walk down the Hollywood walk of fame you are constantly hounded by dress up characters. Some literally even grab you to get a photo and then demand money. Visiting L.A was always a dream of mine and I was so disappointed. We felt so unsafe. Most evenings we stayed in the hotel itself. We went to Beverley hills and found the experience much the same as we did in Hollywood. ",,,,,,,,Manager-247,General Manager,2019-12-16,"Dear Sausagedog97,

Patrick B,25,"Belfast, United Kingdom",2019-11-30,SOLO,2019-12-08,5,Old Hollywood Charm with a Modern Twist,"Stayed here for 7 nights from 24th November to 1st December. 

It was my first trip back to LA in 15 years and I am so glad I chose to stay in the Roosevelt. Yes it is more expensive than many other hotels in the area, but you get what you pay for. 

Firstly this is a hotel with a lot of character, you only have to look at the lobby and read about the history of the hotel to realise this.

The room was very comfortable, clean, tastefully decorated, well maintained by housekeeping and I slept well every night in the awesome 4 post bed. All the staff from Front Desk to Housekeeping to Security to Bar/Restaurant were very pleasant.

The location for me was perfect to explore ALL of LA without a car, Uber/Lyft to various areas were relatively inexpensive and there is a Metro Rail Station nearby. Even better, classic Hollywood landmarks like Musso & Frank, Chinese Theater and Boardners Bar were all on the doorstep.

I plan on returning to LA in late summer 2020, I will definitely be returning to the Roosevelt!!

We thought the location would be great and booked it through a booking site after good reviews. The hotel was less than stellar. The rooms renovation was very janky,  paint chips, stained floors and overall no attention to detail. The shower didn't work well and you couldn't adjust which way it sprayed. It was all or nothing - as well it did not drain great. We mentioned these items to the hotel staff and was only offered a cup of coffee. We also had a yappy dog in the room next to us. We never called down to complain because just as we were about to it would stop and we didn't want to have to pack up everything up and move. In hind site I wish we would have.

Anam A,82,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",2019-11-30,COUPLES,2019-11-26,4,Great Location | Comfortable rooms,"This is a heritage hotel with great history. The hotel has two entrances. One which directly connects to the lobby and one through the porch just around the corner. Take that entrance as it has the staff to assist you with your luggage. I’ll come back to the lobby later. The checkin was very smooth. The hotel has a only credit card policy for the security deposit which is rather strange. It takes a long time and repeated emails for you to get your security back, especially for international tourists. We had a bed with queen bed, rather basic but it was good and comfortable and with a nice view. The bathrooms are small but its ok. Hollywood Walk of Fame is the walkway for the hotel so it is rather interesting. Coming back to the lobby. The lobby is huge, it has antique architecture and a vintage look to it. I was pretty amazed by it. I would recommend checking out the pool as it is really good. I really liked the bar. FYI, hotel offers free coffee at the reception in the morning. Not sure of the timings through. The Chinese theater is a 2min walk and Madam Tussauds is just opposite the hotel. So this is the spot if you are on a 100% touristy trip. Not to mention the Star Tours also start from right outside the hotel. I loved the property inspite of the miniature room they gave us on our honeymoon! Everything else made up for it!

The rooms are comfortable although not as posh as one might expect for the price...its the location and the high property value that affects the price.  We stayed on the twelfth (top) floor and found the evening quiet and peaceful.  The property is lovely, the pool area has a wonderful pool side cafe with a limited but delicious menu.  The cafe fronts Hollywood Boulevard and includes a bar; the menu is delectable including a Beyond Burger for vegetarians/vegans.  The Hotel is the site of the very first Academy Awards and many wonderful Hollywood events are held there so you just never know who you might see.  Most recently Ed Asner's 90th Birthday celebration was held there...Jackson Brown, Cloris Leachman, Darius Rucker (Hootie and the Blowfish) and Mark Hamil among many other stars were there.  The Hotel is elegant in its period fashion and I hope it is never changed.  Its located across the street from Grumans Chinese Theater, the sidewalk outside its front doors are embedded with stars.

JourneyWithUss,841,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",2019-11-30,NONE,2019-11-03,3,"PERFECT LOCATION – SMALL ROOMS, Beautiful Pool, LOCATED on HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD!","The Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel is the place to be when staying in Hollywood. 

Inside is filled with old Hollywood décor and the lobby, restaurant and bar areas are often frequented by wealthy businessmen or Hollywood Z-listers. It is located directly opposite the world famous 'Chinese Theatre' on Hollywood Boulevard (where the host the latest film premieres) and is amidst the hustle and bustle of everyday Hollywood life. 

We had a great time at this hotel but we must say we was a little disappointed in the standard of services to price paid ratio. 

We drove to the Roosevelt and used the valet service at the hotel to park our car, be very wary if you're doing this for long stays as valet is $40 per night. We found the valet guys to be rude and un-organised; nobody seemed to know what was going on and two valet drivers almost got into an argument about whose turn it was to park the car – not a great welcome to a hotel which we paid $1,600 for 5 nights). 

The lady at the check-in desk was very helpful and explained to us what was happening in the area and in the hotel itself. We checked into our room and were surprised at how small it was (literally a bed, long table attached to the wall, fridge, bathroom – with walk in shower and toilet, built in wardrobe and balcony). We knew the hotel was in a central location but didn't realise the rooms would be this small. Also, there were absolutely no amenities in our room whatsoever (no toiletries, mini bar, water etc). 

The beds were comfortable and the room was completely sound-proof so you couldn't hear what was happening by the pool or on the boulevard (unless you opened your balcony door). There was a safe in the room and a TV with most of the American channels. 

The pool area was absolutely divine and one of the best I have seen in America. We enjoyed this for 4 out of the 5 days we stayed however, they have pool parties on Sundays which (unless you pay a considerable amount for a table) you cannot really enjoy as all the sun-loungers are taken. Bear this in mind when booking this hotel as you may expect to at least enjoy the pool if you're spending over $200 a night to stay here. 

There were 2 restaurants within the hotel (one in the main lobby and one located on the boulevard) – both were absolutely divine and the food tasted great!)

Distances:

Hollywood Boulevard – 30 seconds
Universal Studios – 10 min taxi
Dodgers Stadium – 25-30 min taxi (usually traffic on game days)
Santa Monica – 25 min taxi
Venice Beach – 30 min taxi
Malibu – 35 min taxi
Rodeo Drive – 25 min taxi
Beverly Hills – 20 min taxi

If you've visited Hollywood before, you will know that homelessness is a problem here, so be wary when walking the streets late at night and try to opt for an Uber. 

Overall we had a fab stay but would probably choose somewhere different on our next visit to Hollywood.

Welcomed by the valet parking guys and directed to check in. All very friendly. Got to the room  and it was very clean and functional.Probably the smallest room we had during our tour,certainly the smallest bed. Dropped the luggage and went to the pool area for a drink.This is a nice place to be with virtually no noise from the outside. not in the best area, we got told to F-off on the walk of fame by a 'female'. We may have walked on her favourite star.

Thwe day we checked out we were given a receipt. We had a friendly conversation with the staff about where to go for the day before we heade to the airport. (FAO we went to Manhattan beach. Beautiful area 5 miles from LAX)

Having got to the airport and got wifi my wife found an e-mai; from the Hotel with an extra item on it for about $15. Apparantly we had taken an international phone adapter kit from the minibar. In all honesty we did not take anything from the minibar. I dont know anybody who uses them. I wish you could ask for them to be removed from the room or locked up,

The hotel is hip and gorgeous without appearing to try too hard.  Service was universally exceptional, from check-in all the way to check-out.  We ponied up for the cabana rooms which were worth the additional expense.  It was just beyond the pool party season but hanging out and having cocktails poolside was a terrific time. It’s a gorgeous pool and one of the nicer pool vibes I’ve seen in LA. The location is perfect, in that you’re very central to exploring all the different neighborhoods in Los Angeles, which you absolutely should. (I personally think Hollywood Blvd itself is a tourist trap not worthy of one’s time, but you didn’t feel like you were anywhere near it when in the beautiful hotel or hanging by the pool.)

A special thank you to Amy in the concierge. She was tremendously helpful with some details in advance of the stay, helped at check-in, and even reached out during my stay to see if all was well. Truly fantastic service.  I’ll be back in large part because of her. (And that pool!)",,,,,,,,Manager-247,General Manager,2019-10-24,"Dear MojoTheHelperMonkey,

I think they must have put me in the worst one they had. Avoid room 220. It has absolutely no view or balcony, faces the street, and has a connecting door to the room next door. To top it all off it’s across the hall from the housekeeping closet. We could hear the people in the adjoining room talking and for some reason could hear a lot of plumbing sounds. 

The room overall also needs a refresh. It had worn and chipped paint, gouges in the bathroom door and stained tile in the shower.

The hotel could also have been cleaner. There were pool towels just laying in the hallway and a breakfast tray that hadn’t been picked up at 9pm. Definitely not worth the priced paid. ",,,,,,,,Manager-247,General Manager,2019-10-17,"Dear Imcpr,

First of all, the location was amazing it was just across the street from the Hollywood Walk of fame and the metro which we took to Universal Studios. There were plenty of restaurants, pharmacy and liquor stores for us to buy our necessities which we forgot to bring. We stayed a good 4 nights there. We ate in the restaurant 25 degrees for breakfast and we also ate by the pool for lunch and breakfast and for dinner we went to a bar with a bowling alley on the 2nd floor and all of them had such delicious and quality food and presentation. I don’t usually say this but it is so pleasant that their service and food were consistently pleasant. Everyone was so friendly and helpful. The pool had a special and hippy vibe to it. Even the people by the pool were cool and we had a movie producer who was doing an interview by the pool . I can understand why they do film movies or shows here. When you are at the lift corridor they had pictures of movies stars who were there so you get to imagine what it was like back in the days. We were lucky to also see Angelina Jolie when she had a movie premiere at the Hollywood walk of fame for Maleficient the movie. Best of all the after party for the movie was held in the same hotel. Although security was tight we cannot help to take a peak on who was there. The hotel lobby on the first floor was bigger and had a nice old school interior. The check in lobby was small but it also led to a Roosevelt theater which caters to comedy nights on weekends. The bellboys and concierge was also friendly and helpful with our questions. Although the room is small we had a nice view of the mountain where some luxury houses were. I definitely can go on about how amazing my experience was but being a flight attendants who lives in a suitcase I want to recommend this hotel to everyone.",,,,,,,,Manager-247,General Manager,2019-10-15,"Dear nonanureen,

Bathroom was the absolute worst part, needs a good clean tiles are filthy and I didn’t enjoy stepping into this room. Way too small and no room for any toiletries.
Only 1 elevator working which was a massive inconvenience. 
Almost taking up to 10 minutes to access the elevator to get up or down.

Blake B,31,"Charlotte, North Carolina",2019-09-30,NONE,2019-09-18,3,The saving grace of location - but so many sad surprises,"Four-night stay with three of us in a two queen room. Our biggest issue during our stay was we were sad to discover it's *hotel policy* to only allow two lounge chairs by the pool per room, so if you are staying with double occupancy, keep that in mind. If the pool were completely packed, I would understand, but here is where I was penalized by honesty. We only tried to use the pool one time, too. Worst case scenario you could lie and say you are in separate rooms because, while they ask if you are guests, there is no mechanism in place to ensure it. 
The cons:
1. After check-in, we were informed we had to use the service elevator (there's only one) during our stay. We were delighted to discover on day 3 that ONE of the guests elevators wasn't broken but spending $300+ per night to ride with service staff wasn't what we had in mind.
2. There is no in-room coffee. A carafe was $20 delivered.
3. There are no top sheets, so if you are a germ freak you better pray to your Gods that they strip the duvets after the turnover of each and every room.
4. The floor lamp in our room was broken.
5. We stood in water in our shower (tub) day after day.
6. The TV reception had several connectivity freezes throughout our stay.

The pros:
1. The housekeeping staff were very friendly and warm nd did a good job. However, there is a thick layer of dust on the bathroom fixtures so leave your white gloves at home.
2. Quite possibly some of the best, flattest hotel (feather?) pillows I've ever slept on.
3. At least two on-site restaurants you can enjoy. We ate at both but found the service a little ""stuffy"" and inattentive at Public Kitchen + Bar.
4. Beautiful property overall.

In summary, it's doubtful I would stay here again. The location is outstanding but there were enough service issues to drown out any geographic privileges.",,2.0,2.0,,5.0,,,Manager-247,General Manager,2019-09-19,"Dear Blake B,

It is a fantastic location for sightseeing yet you can hide away from the hustle of bustle of the Boulevard by chilling out by the enormous pool, we were there on a Sunday, when they have a live DJ which gave a really great vibe to the Tropicana pool/bar.
Both food and service at the pool were excellent, especially from our Waitresses Kelly and Steph :) Would definitely recommend the Shrimp Tacos- delicious!

There are no tea and coffee making facilities, but our maid brought us a kettle, and we had tea bags. tea and coffee are available between 6am & 9am in the lobby, but don't be late. Liked the pool area, pool was heated. Thought the lobby was a bit dark, not to our taste maybe needed updating. There are only two elevators serving 12 floors, for 4 days one of these was out, leading to a longer wait. The service elevator was made available, but was also in use by staff.

Matt89Myles,5,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",2019-09-30,COUPLES,2019-09-14,5,Very cool hotel.,"Just back from a 5 night stay and the hotel was everything we hoped for! It was our first trip to LA, and the last leg of our USA honeymoon and reckon we picked the perfect hotel and setting to take in the LA vibe. 

The lobby area is great to chill out in and the bars were superb....we were pleasantly surprised to stumble across the library bar one evening which had a very cool atmosphere to go with the amazing cocktails.

A perfect location if you wish to explore Hollywood.

The hotel pool area is excellent, again with a very cool vibe....the only slight negative I would have is that on our one chill out day at the pool we were asked every 15mins if we would like a drink by the waitresses, which was ok at first but became a bit irritating when trying to relax and also felt a bit pressured to be honest, especially when trying to enjoy the drinks we did buy which were not cheap.

To summarise - Loved the hotel, rooms very comfortable and again, excellently located and felt good knowing after a long day exploring LA we had such a good hotel to come back to. A mention also to the cleaning staff who were very friendly and ran like clockwork, they do a tremendous job.

Thanks for having us!",,,,,,,,Manager-247,General Manager,2019-09-16,"Hello Matt89myles,

The hotel is in the middle of it all and easy to get around (recommend Uber) car rental not worth it with the cost of hotel parking and traffic - you want to sit and gaze not worry about driving. The hotel is a beautiful iconic Hollywood landmark, very cool vibe - check out different floors if you like movie star photos. The front door staff are very helpful at recommending tourist spots, tours and restaurants. The King room was much too small with a roll away bed for 3 - it looks larger in the photos on the website than it really is... book the largest room you can afford if room comfort is of importance to you. We stayed 3 nights which was a good amount of time to do a few tours, and get a feel for the place. We ate at the hotel pool restaurant and 24hr diner - both were good, there are lots of food options in that area and stores where you can grab snacks. We saw some celebrities and there was a tv show filming in front of the hotel, apparently the industry uses the hotel back parking lot for filming in the area - that was cool. Overall 5 stars for the location and rich history of the hotel and about 3.5 for the room,",,,,,,,,Manager-247,General Manager,2019-09-09,"Dear KC2501,

You are hidden from the crowd that is poolside but still hear the music. Once you shut the door to the room, most of the poolside noise is a distant memory! There are plenty of options if you need to host a business gathering of various sizes.

The security staff who still were doing their duties but would stop to have a few words or a quick conversation each day (Roger and Donald thank you).

Grand in scale, clean rooms, nice pool.  The service is good.  Poolside parties and a wedding in the foyer. I would have placed 3 people to work the front desk instead of two.

Brad Goodman,7,"Warrnambool, Australia",2019-08-31,NONE,2019-08-26,4,Great hotel,"Stayed here for 5 nights August 2019, we were very happy, rooms were kept very clean, service was great, from the restaurants to the pool and reception staff, everyone was friendly and helpful. happy to answer any questions or concerns. They offer a laundry service was quite costly. There is a laundry close by called la Brea coin laundry, clean and cheap. We did our laundry there. Only issue I had was they put a hold of $1,200 AU on my debit card ($700.00 US I think) (don’t have a credit card) they didn’t tell me the amount they were holding. Was a shock when looked at bank balance on phone to see that being held. No issues with money being held I only wish they had made it clear the amount they were holding.

The room was superb! We upgraded to a cabana suite which was very clean, had modern decor, fully stocked mini bar, a cute bathroom with amazing beauty lights and so many more positives! We did have a few events at the pool on the nights we stayed there, however the room was great at blocking out noise and we honestly slept so well (the comfy bed may have helped with that)! 
Another benefit was the location of the hotel itself. A minute away from Hollywood Boulevard (Chinese theatre, walk of fame and multiple tourist locations), a few minutes from the famous In-N-Out and a short drive from Beverly Hills and The Grove. 
The staff here are also a pleasure! Having stayed here for 6 days, the staff here definitely made our stay much more enjoyable. We were always welcomed with a smile and a polite conversation. 
The Hollywood Roosevelt was exceptional. I personally could not fault it at all and I understand why it is such a high volume hotel with a large number of guests (so get down to the pool early so you don’t miss your chance)! It truly made my partners and my own, first international trip comfortable and gave us that homey feeling! We will definitely be back!

First, for festival attendees- this is the only place you should stay. It’s a tiring week and having the convenience of popping up to your room for a moment changes the experience. Hollywood Blvd has a lot of sketchy and homeless characters but once you step inside the lovely doors - you are safe. 
If you are a foreign traveler- this is a safe haven in the midst of the crazy life of historic Hollywood and Sunset Boulevards. There is a CVS pharmacy across the street.  Inexpensive eateries all around but also, across the street is The Historic Grauman s Theater with the wonderful handprints and signatures of the famous movie stars from the 1920’s and on. For the shoppers - you don’t need to go anywhere else but the mall connected to the theater. All of your upscale shopping can be done there. In n out Burger is a 3 block walk. The hotel staff is incredibly welcoming and helpful. They even remember our names each year! The hotel lobby and pool area has the “classic Hollywood “ look. I have been asked before if it was appropriate for children. Yes. And I have noticed dogs but cannot speak for the pet policy. Pictures of the theater across the street and me with my friends in the lobby and then”room with a view.”",,,,,,,,Manager-247,General Manager,2019-08-23,"Dear jacquecarr,

Raffie the parking manager and his staff had the vehicle ready within 3 minutes or less of our phone call and that was all week! Never was there a delay, great job from the parking staff to say the least..

The first night we called reception after dinner to complain about the strong odour of marijuana in the hallway and in our room and to confirm the hotel is non smoking. We were told security would be sent to investigate. 

However, tonight, we’ve returned after a day out of the hotel and our room still smells of marijuana. We’ve been given the option to leave the room for an hour to have it cleaned, but we’re jet lagged and the front desk were already aware of the problem during it’s first clean today. I’m now wishing I had zipped up the suitcases to protect my clothes from the smell. 

I wouldn’t recommend staying at this hotel for families or unless you are comfortable with sleeping in what smells like a hot box.

Honest Ed,78,"St. Neots, United Kingdom",2019-08-31,FAMILY,2019-08-10,4,Hollywood Roosevelt review ,"Loved staying in this hotel, feels like a real blast of Hollywood history as soon as you walk through the doors. Staff are friendly and eager to help. The place is very clean and the decor is stunning. 
We were lucky enough to get a corner room with views of the Hollywood hills and Downtown. The rooms are spacious, clean. 
The pool is large and can get a little busy but we got there early so pretty much had it to ours for a couple of hours.  
I do have a couple of issues with the hotel: 
Firstly, the constant buzz/humming throughout the hotel. It's not so bad during the day but when you try to sleep it sounds like someone is running a generator outside your room, to the point where we were going to change to a different room on a different floor but upon checking it out the noise was there too, you can hear in on every floor.
Secondly,  They seem to put on a lot of events here which can be a pain as they tend to close off parts of the hotel such as the lobby or the pool, it happened a couple of times when we were here and messed up one afternoon as we were going to chill in the pool but it had been blocked off to everyone except private guests. When you are paying this much to stay in a hotel and they close the pool for the day for a private function it is kind of a liberty. 

Apart from that it is a beautiful hotel and I am glad we stayed there.....and I would definitely stay here again. ",,,,,,,,Manager-247,General Manager,2019-08-12,"Hello 614lancee,

Now for the downside, when we arrived we were told that the pool was closed (turns out for an after party). This also meant that other parts of the hotel were inaccessible and that we didn't get much sleep . The party security (must point out, not hotel staff) were in the main very rude and we couldn't stand /sit anywhere in the hotel without being ""moved on"". The worst thing was being told to ""go somewhere else"" when trying to use the elevator to go to our room ( luckily shortly after this a member of hotel staff intervened and made the security let us use the elevator). This was discussed with hotel staff the following day who were very helpful. I understand that the hotel is used regularly for these events but I think that the other guests who are staying should be treated with respect(Perhaps the extra security need some customer service training ? ). It was a shame as the hotel is lovely . I would suggest asking for a room which does not overlook the pool/car park as it would be quieter .

Shooter25,2304,"Sydney, Australia",2019-06-30,SOLO,2019-07-26,4,Brief but enjoyable,"Was a really nice but albeit brief stay at the Roosevelt earlier this month.

After a work conference in Vegas, it was a solid base for a few days in LA being right on Hollywood Blvd, the Walk of fame, Big Bus Tours and the metro train. 

The hotel itself is full of character - my Studio Room for the most part was well appointed, but maintained the heritage charm from a bygone era. 

Bedding is comfortable, and the room was an excellent size with a couch, desk/sitting area.

The Shower was over a bath, so definitely not ideal for those with accessibility needs, but perfect for me.

A few things stand out though:

1. No kettles in the room  - for for a four star hotel to not have this basic facility is a huge disappointment.

2. No shower gel - again for a hotel of this class this should be a minimum requirement.

Check in was a breeze and all my staff interactions were warm, genuine and engaging also.

Dining wise - I did try the 25 Degrees Burger restaurant - was definitely not let down with the burger, flavour, taste and otherwise. 

Do note though it is not cheap, even more so for Aussies now and the exchange rate, but still well worth the visit!

I did try the pool one afternoon - whilst a pleasant spot, it does get crowded, so I'd get in early if you wanted to find a chair.

LadyDi_and_Cowman,277,"Los Angeles, California",2019-07-31,COUPLES,2019-07-24,5,Cool Vibe and Gorgeous Historic Hotel!,"We enjoyed our overnight visit and were upgraded to a balcony cabana room. Nice room and we really enjoyed the balcony, however it is a bit noisy. The music by the pool played until about midnight, we sat out until 11 pm and it played on quite a bit past that. The people in room next door came in about 3:30 am and were very loud including talking out on their balcony - probably late nite club-goers. It was strange we didn't have a top sheet on our bed, just a duvet comforter....not sure if this was an oversite by housekeeping or they wash duvet covers after each guest? We were a little concerned about this.
Our TV didn't work, and the front desk was nice enough to send us a free pot of coffee from room service in the morning, which was very nice.
We enjoyed cocktails at the Tropicana pool bar, a fun setting, great service and delicious craft cocktails!
We loved wondering around such a beautiful historic hotel. Before we checked out the front desk arranged for us to have a private showing of the terrace at the very top - breathtaking views! 
The staff are all amazing and super friendly, we felt very welcome and will definitely stay again.",,,5.0,3.0,,,5.0,Manager-247,General Manager,2019-07-25,"Dear ladyDi_and_Cowman,

Nadine R,15,"Toronto, Canada",2019-07-31,FAMILY,2019-07-23,5,So glad we came back for another visit!,"Little did we know that exactly a year later, we decided to come back to the Roosevelt... We received such great service that we had to return for more.
From the moment we arrived the staff welcomed us back like if we were family.  Mark the Bell Captain is phenomenal.  He always greets you with a smile and handshake.  He makes the impossible possible with no matter the request.  What we love most is that he is so knowledgable in his recommendations on where to visit and places to see.  During this second stay, we opted not to do the typical tourist attractions but experienced a lot of local events and places to dine at.  Mark is your go to guy for all types of advice when visiting Hollywood.   
Each day we were greeted by Rocco (another bell team member).  He was very kind and always interested on hearing about our daily adventures.  
The front desk team (especially Alex) are fantastic in making the check in & check out a seamless task.  They accommodated our every request when choosing a room.  
The location of this hotel is in a very high traffic area right on Hollywood Blvd with so many tourists.  The security team takes their job very seriously in making sure that the Roosevelt Guests are safe in the common areas of the hotel.  Security Guards Donald and Roger are great guys to chat with each day.  The maintenance team works very hard at keeping this hotel spotless and safe as well.
If you have a chance to sit at the historical lobby bar, Shannon the bartender is amazing.  She is super fun and mixes drinks to perfection.  She is a huge Fan expo/Comicon expert and has a lot of insight of some cool places & events to check out in the area.  
We had the pleasure of staying at the Roosevelt for 17 days and during that time Priscilla (a housekeeping team member on the 7th floor) went over and beyond in helping with our room amenities.  E.J is another fantastic member that would help us out whenever we were in a pinch with any hotel room items or around the pool area. 
We came back to this hotel because of their service excellence and we plan on returning whenever we visit Los Angeles.
We have such an appreciation for the beautiful ambience of this historic hotel and the many stories of the people that have called this their home over the years. I highly recommend this hotel for all guests that want to receive the highest form of customer service away from the comforts of your own home.",Rooms overlooking the Valet parking are quieter.,,5.0,,5.0,,5.0,Manager-247,General Manager,2019-07-24,"Hello lavillarana,

coopr,9,,2019-07-31,NONE,2019-07-21,5,Outstanding overnight for a show at nearby Hollywood Bowl ,"Totally loved it! Came for just one night to see a show at the nearby Hollywood Bowl - which worked great because there is a $6 (round trip) shuttle bus from across the street from the hotel to the Bowl. 

We booked what we thought was a garden terrace room with a private outdoor patio - apparently only some of this room type has the outdoor area, and our reserved room didn't - but a quick conversation with the friendly front desk staff resulted in a considerate upgrade to a pool-view room with a patio that was perfect!

Everyone else working at the hotel was similarly friendly and helpful - the pool hostess, the waiters, even the security guards!

We stayed a Saturday night, and there were pool parties both Sat and Sun afternoon - the music was terrific, the crowd was gorgeous, and the vibe was perfect. Note that it was also loud - don't stay pool side on a party day/night unless you too are planning to party. The desk staff was helpfully clear on this point as we checked in, so we knew we picked a room with a... soundtrack :)

The interior design here is super groovy, the landscaping was perfectly tended, the food was excellent (if slightly pricey - but whatever, we were dining in style poolside so we didn't care!). 

Highly recommended - we will be back for certain. ",,,,,,,,Manager-247,General Manager,2019-07-22,"Hello coopr,

The only negative is that someone on our non smoking floor didn’t follow the rules and that’s all we could smell for our stay.  The desk said they would have moved us, but we didn’t think to ask.  We spent most of our visit touring all day anyway.

Our room was very small and although this is common in big US cities, I was disappointed given the price we had paid. The pool area is lovely and the staff were extremley attentive.

Nis L,24,"Copenhagen, Denmark",2019-07-31,FAMILY,2019-07-05,2,Thank you again for Joint'ing us in Hollywood!,"Nice location and a young and pretty hip vibe for the party crowd. Less a place  for families unless you are very open minded to cannabis or need to show your kids a different world.

The solid smelll of Joints being smoked by the pool while the kids are playing is a bit over the top. Maybe they should limit drug intake to certain times or areas just a little bit even though its pretty rock'n'roll - or maybe just consider promoting more smell free drugs like heroine.😀

Closing down more than half the pool for the whole day of July 4th without announcing it to the guests was really terrible for us as a family and made us leave early from the hotel. We even asked the staff on the 3rd  if there wood be problems getting  a sun chair on the 4th and they did not mention the private party.

Rooms are somewhat outdated but stylish  and air conditioning noisy as having Def Leppard giving a concert  in the room.

When we checked out early due to the pool closure we received both excuses and got out of our next night booking for free. No cancellation fee and a free valet parking.
The staff at the reception were nice and very understanding without being able to do much about their the decision made by hotel management.

All in all. If you are ready to party and smoke some weed - go there. If you are a family with kids you should probably go somewhere else.",,,,,,,,Manager-247,General Manager,2019-07-05,"Dear Cloudchecker,

But if you are a coffee freak like myself, they will go to the wall and even risk losing your business not to provide you with your morning Joe.
No in room coffee makers.
Very limited coffee in lobby that once gone will not be refilled. (I went at 7 am and was too late)
I really can’t imagine who made this business decision in this day and age not to have coffee available 24/7 let alone not even in morning.  
Very short sighted poor business decision in the new world of most folks love and demand their coffee.

The rooms were clean but not huge but we just got a room for the two of us, weekend trip away. There may be larger rooms. The location was good for a tourist as it is right on Hollywood Blvd which is not a nice clean area but you are right on the walk of fame and caddy corner across from the Chinese theater as well as shopping , Jimmy Kimmel’s studio and souvenir shops.

I have to admit, that because I was travelling on business I actually didn't do a lot of research of where the hotel was located so I didn't realise that the hotel is directly on Hollywood Blvd.  That was a bit of a pleasant surprise when my colleagues let me know and we went for a bit of a wonder along the stars on the first evening.

I had a room in the tower, which was comfortable and had everything I needed - comfortable bed, desk, storage & safe, plus good free WiFi.  My only complaint is that the airconditioning fan (which was over the bathroom) was making a lot of noise, meaning that I wasn't so keen on having it on during the night, or when I was in the bathroom in the morning as it just resonated through the room.

BobN06,449,"Avondale, Pennsylvania",2019-06-30,FAMILY,2019-06-06,3,"Classic = dated, lost most if not all of its history",Seems like an old hotel trying to be more relevant. Fails at both - lost most if not all historical feel and saddled with trying to decorate the structure of a dated hotel. Booked on a low floor so only a view of the AC units outside. No convenient stairs to take instead of the elevator. Hallway looks very dated and smells musty. Room small and poor usage of the space. Loud AC unit in the room. Bathroom amenities appeared to be a mixed bag of leftovers from other hotels. Friendly staff was the one redeeming features.,Would try for a higher floor,3.0,5.0,,,2.0,,Manager-247,General Manager,2019-06-10,"Dear BobN06,

David L,16,,2019-06-30,BUSINESS,2019-06-05,3,"Nice property and location, but arrogant","This is a nice hotel. Good location in Hollywood. Proper swanky level for the price.  The problem is they are super incredulous and arrogant about the inconvenience ""private events"" pose to their guests.  The entire lobby area was closed. Guests could only enter and exit the hotel through the back door. We chose this hotel because the Teddy bar looked perfect to meet with clients. Now we had to site by the pool at the ""pool bar"". Not conducive to our needs.

I guess what even more irked me was the attitude the staff and even the desk manager I spoke to had about it.  Basically they made me feel like I should be happy they were hosting some movie event at their hotel while I was staying there, rather than acknowledging it was a major inconvenience for my situation. 

At any rate, it's a decent spot if you're just wanting to party around Hollywood. Pretty people hang out by the pool and rooms are OK. They just need to get over themselves and be more sensitive to guests when they're hosting their ""LA private event"" type things.",,,2.0,4.0,,4.0,,Manager-247,General Manager,2019-06-06,"Dear David L,

Thank you for sharing your thoughts with us, which we can assure you we take to heart.

UncleA,238,"Chagrin Falls, Ohio",2019-05-31,NONE,2019-05-30,5,Classic Hotel on Hollywood Boulevard,"While the area is rather touristy, you can forget the crowds inside this classic hotel.  Rooms are comfortable and spacious.  Great pool with very attentive staff.  Registration staff were all very pleasant and professional.  Attended a wedding ceremony which was held in the lobby and then a reception on the roof.  We had some rain but still partied under umbrellas.  The food was great.  Also enjoyed the old fashioned bowling lanes in the bar.
My only complaint was that our room wasn't ready when we arrived late morning (which I wasn't surprised about) but the staff said they would call when our room was ready and no one called.  Once we came back a few hours later our room was indeed ready, but it took about 30 minutes to get our bags brought up to us.  Overall, however, I would recommend this Hollywood Roosevelt for a classic stay in Hollywood.",,,,,,,,Manager-247,General Manager,2019-05-31,"Greetings UncleA,

Rocco the bellhop was the best! He was helpful, kind and he knew so much history about this iconic hotel. The people at check-in were welcoming, as were the employees at the pool (which was so warm!). 25 degrees (the casual restaurant) had excellent cocktails, milk shakes, and food. (No one was very friendly there either time we went, but we didn’t care too much about that.)

Wendell W,48,"San Diego, California",2019-05-31,BUSINESS,2019-05-12,5,Worth Waiting 40 Years,"I had been saying for 40 years (on dozens of trips) that I wanted to stay at the Roosevelt - its history is legendary and as a film buff I wanted to have the chance to explore.  Though I only had one night to do so (a quick business trip), it was well worth the wait.  The valet (on Orange Drive) whisked away the car, and the front desk staff, pleasant and attentive, got me to my suite in record time.  I was astounded by the size of the suite (I was expecting much smaller for the price) and how beautifully furnished, quiet, and comfortable it was - the view was pretty great as well.  Being in the middle of it all, had I been a tourist I would have been grateful for the proximity to sites to which I could walk - it was also walkable to my business meeting, so I got to see a neighborhood I hadn't been in in many years (and which has changed in ways I was not happy about, but that's another story).  The Roosevelt has maintained its integrity and historic detail - I had been there a number of times for lunch and dinner in the past - and was worth a stroll around.  Room service was exceptional, and both dinner and breakfast were promptly served and delicious.  If you want a taste of Old Hollywood (in the midst, unfortunately, of the new with a few things still to see, though) with great prices for exceptional service, food and location, this is the place to stay.",,,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,Manager-247,General Manager,2019-05-13,"Dear Wendell W,

The bed may be the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in.  The tv cable reception was awful, and the tv was far across the room from the bed.

My room was clean and comfortable.  Service by staff was very considerate, too.  I also enjoyed their 25 Degrees restaurant, a fun spot to eat at any time!  Finally, the hotel is centrally located for sightseeing around Hollywood!

My one fault with this hotel was that its Wi-Fi system was out of order.  I tried to sign onto this system when I checked in, but could not do so.  I was later told that their Wi-Fi was out of order.  Hotel guests expect good Wi-Fi these days, and this is one area the Hollywood Roosevelt should improve on!

On our arrival we were allocated a room with a four poster bed. Because it was my birthday we found in our room a bottle of Prosecco and a plate of cookies. 

Whilst we were there a wedding was taking place. To incorporate this function most of the Hotel was sealed off to other guests in terms of accessibility. I've never experienced that before.

During the evening when this wedding function was taking place we experienced severe noise problems. Our bedroom was on the 12th Floor. Throughout the night I presume guests were singing and laughing on our floor and making regular trips to the ice machine. 

I did contact the duty manager, who couldn't have been more helpful. He sent security up who in turn spoke to the people who were making the noise and brought it to an abrupt end. We were also provided with a complimentary breakfast which was a nice touch.

The Hotel is located on Hollywood Boulevard virtually opposite the famous Chinese Theatre.",,3.0,5.0,,,,4.0,Manager-247,General Manager,2019-04-22,"Hello Moonlightcruiser,

Front desk immediately upgraded to a suite, which was nice. However that was when the niceness ended. First it was a $5 charge for the minibar which was not used. Second three different times saying, confirming and reconfirming parking was waived (it wasn’t). Then a $148 charge for three cars to park at the hotel (yes they couldn’t explain that one either). When I called to request info, they refunded $54 (including tax). Left the $90 parking fee; when I said would pursue a charge back, they challenged me to do it. No desire to want business travelers. The reservation agent sounded like this is a normal business practice. Trading on tourists’ inexperience is not good business, but doing shenanigans is just wrong. Avoid this hotel.

ALeamas,22,"London, United Kingdom",2019-04-30,SOLO,2019-04-11,5,Roosevelt's Recovery Skills 10/10,"The Hollywood Roosevelt continues to impress yet this time for its handling of a tricky situation - a sleep-deprived, post-flight customer. Namely, me. Anyone flying to LA from Asia will be thumped hard by 72 hours of intense jet lag, and the second night is often worse than the first. I was staying at The Roosevelt and was given a wonderful room overlooking the famous Hockney Pool, near the Cabanas. All was good and I was happy to be a returning and loyal customer. 

By more bad luck than anything, the room next door to mine (the famous Marilyn Monroe suite) was hired for a post-black tie drinks party which went on til the early hours and was followed up by an eager builder and his drill at 0800. No sleep. 

The big challenge now is how the hotel would deal with it. Manager Alex Roy and his high professional staff rose to the occasion immediately and with no deliberation. They knew exactly what to do and no training can teach you that. Their EQ is high. Period. I won't detail how Alex saved the day (private between myself and the hotel) but I can assure the reader that he handled it with the utmost courtesy and a genuine air of understanding. I will definitely continue to be a returning customer. It is that professional and decent service that we rarely see these days, including with some of the 5+ star hotels. 

I also want to mention front desk's Nicole who, on my last visit, sent a complimentary welcome package of cookies and a couple of beers. Again, she didn't have to do that. It is these extra personal touches that separate the hotels of today. It also demonstrates how we need to protect the human side of the hotel experience and push back against the modern-day trend of the online check-in.

Separately, my room was immaculate and the hotel continues to exude that Hollywood history of wonder days gone by, but not forgotten. The one thing that needs fixing is the tetchy WIFI issue out in the pool rooms. Other than that, hats off to a fantastic staff who are way more than just talking heads behind a desk. 10/10","Rooms overlooking the pool are best, maybe on the 2nd floor to avoid any eager partygoers",5.0,5.0,,5.0,,,Manager-247,General Manager,2019-04-12,"Greetings ALeamas,

Every night we were there , there was a private function on and we could not use half of the bars / bowling or amenities (pool). 

On the last night of our honeymoon they held a private function pool party (that we weren’t warned about) the music was sooooo loud the walls were thumping and earplugs did nothing. We couldn’t even hear the TV in our room so had to just lay there and listen to it

However I was shocked by the expense of room service. I expect a service charge and additional room service charge, but not an additional charge on top of that. I ordered breakfast and they added service, then an admin charge and then a 3rd charge was added (just said additional), when I queried it, I was told, that is the charges. So for a 15 dollar breakfast, I paid another 15 dollars in charges!!!
One evening, I was feeling very unwell as I had terrible indigestion. I rang the room service, and asked if I could just have a small glass of milk to ease the pain, and was told I would be charged in total 12 dollars!!! off course I said no. 
These hidden/additional charges, make 2 week stays very expensive, so sadly I won't be staying here again.",,3.0,4.0,,,,5.0,Manager-247,General Manager,2019-03-26,"Hello Sally,

Marti K,89,"El Cajon, California",2019-03-31,COUPLES,2019-03-24,4,A Step into Hollywood History,"Unfortunately, Hollywood today, ain't what she used to be. Unless perhaps you're lucky enough to stay at the  Hollywood Roosevelt.  They have done a beautiful job of restoring the feel of old Hollywood - a bit of glam, seclusion and style that is hard to duplicate. And the stunning black and white photos that line the hallways of stars who have stayed there are amazing.

We stayed for just one night in a King Superior room and have nothing but nice things to say.  The room was stylish, but not over the top, and the bed was really comfortable.  There was only one robe in the robe, so I called for another and housekeeping was there within minutes.  Everyone on the staff was very friendly and seemed genuinely concerned that they addressed our questions adequately.

We met some friends for drinks in the Spare Room, which is very cool with it's carve dark wood and own 2 bowling lanes.  And FYI, if you want to bowl or even have a table for drinks, you need to call ahead and reserve.  My only complaint was that the music was so loud you couldn't really have a decent conversation.  Next time we will rendez-vous at the bar out by the pool which is very 1950's California.

We will certainly stay there again even though the valet charge for the car was a ridiculous $49!  Just a very good vibe.",,,5.0,,5.0,5.0,,Manager-247,General Manager,2019-03-25,"Dear Marti K,

As first time visitors to LA from the UK we were enthralled by this iconic hotel. Our room was wonderful, very clean, very quiet and extremely comfortable with views to the Chinese Theatre and the Hollywood sign. The front desk staff were very helpful and polite. As the weather was unseasonably cold we didn’t take advantage of the pool which turned out to be closed for renovation of the David Hockney design but it was still an awesome sight with no water in.  Our only complaint was that on Sunday morning prior to leaving for our cruise the only place open for breakfast was the ‘25 degrees’ bar which was open to the public and and (understandably) very busy. This was surprising that there wasn’t anywhere for hotel guests. But all in all we had a great stay in the best location!

After two nights, I realized that the ice machine wasn't working on the floor I was on. I called down to front desk and told Ali Benjamin about it (it wasn't an issue for me as I just went to the floor below for ice). But, within 30 minutes, there was a technician working on the ice machine. I run a small hotel in Greece and this type of service is truly amazing. Ali communicated the problem to the proper department and I have to also give props to the engineering dept for getting someone on the issue so quickly.

JerseyKid1986,23,"Hong Kong, China",2019-02-28,SOLO,2019-03-06,5,Sleep in a Slice of Hollywood History,"The Roosevelt Hotel holds a noteworthy place in Hollywood lore. Under its roof, luminaries like Douglas Fairbanks, Greta Garbo, Clark Gable, Carole Lombard, Errol Flynn, Marilyn Monroe and Montgomery Clift have dined, danced and dozed. The ghosts of a few are said to still be lingering around. 

Back in 1929, it was the venue of the very first Academy Awards ceremony, before anybody even called them the Oscars. And when ‘All About Eve’ had its West Coast premiere at the Chinese Theatre across Hollywood Boulevard in 1950, the hotel—in a novel neon salute to the film’s titular character—dimmed the lights of its rooftop sign, leaving only the letters E-V-E illuminated. 

To this very day, that old Tinseltown glamour is alive and well at the Roosevelt. And although over half a century has passed since Hollywood’s golden era drew to a close, it’s easy to pretend otherwise within the history-infused corridors of this California landmark.  

Alas, precious few of its Boulevard neighbors retain the distinct air of classic glamour that radiates so effortlessly from the Roosevelt. Musso and Frank survives, a century on, as do the Egyptian Theatre and the El Capitan. But, nowadays, such icons share the sidewalk with tacky costumed characters, multiple wax museums, and scores of souvenir shops peddling fake awards, shot glasses or dime-a-dozen t-shirts… Yet take a couple steps from this chaos into the sunken Spanish Colonial Revival lobby of the hotel and you might just as well have stepped several decades back in time.  

Ever since I was a little kid, it’s been a dream of mine to stay here. So when I was passing through Los Angeles several weeks ago, I excitedly booked a room for the night. Beginning to end, the service was unfailingly fabulous, from Amy at the front desk (who welcomed me with an upgraded room and complimentary cocktail) to the friendly staff at the numerous watering holes scattered about the impeccable property. Everything was just as you’d expect from such storied locale, my only complaint being how brief it all was. 

You may find you’re faced with a minor dilemma as to where to spend the bulk of your time: lounging in the luxurious seclusion of your room—my cabana came complete with an exceedingly comfortable bed, lavish bathroom and balcony overlooking the legendary pool—or indulging in the opulent conspicuousness of the hotel’s convivial bars and restaurants. 

I chose the latter, and during my short stay, I took the opportunity to visit as many of them as possible, from poolside Tropicana to atmospheric Spare Room to stylish Public, jutting into the elegant lobby. I even made a late night pit stop at the in-house, round-the-clock burger joint, 25 Degrees. And while the drinks and food were outstanding in all these locations, I must say, it was the bartenders and waitstaff who really sealed the deal. Approachable and garrulous, each and every one contributed to my memorable evening of gin and nostalgia. 

As I checked out early the next morning—with perpetually chipper Amy again—I couldn’t help wishing I had more time to savor the glories of yesteryear that endure at the Roosevelt. I sincerely hope I’ll be back again soon.",,,5.0,,,5.0,5.0,Manager-247,General Manager,2019-03-07,"Hello JerseyKid,

They gave us the best recommendations for anything and everything. I am a concierge myself and was treated like a queen.

Helly-ally,97,"Enniskerry, Ireland",2019-02-28,NONE,2019-02-25,4,Nice Hotel - Not sure about the location,The Hotel is a nice hotel. The Pool area is great and the Diner is excellent for Breakfast.  The restaurant was good - but the service was a bit up and down.  However the biggest issue when we were there were the lifts.  There are 2 lifts servicing the hotel. When we visited the penthouse was being renovated - so the lift service was awful.  To their credit the Hotel gave us Free Breakfast vouchers to make up for the inconvenience.  The Hotel is well located on Hollywood Boulevard - however I was not impressed by Hollywood and would probably never choose to stay there again - it felt seedy and dangerous. ,,,,,,,,Manager-247,General Manager,2019-02-25,"Dear Helly-ally,

Liz M,50,"Seattle, Washington",2019-02-28,FRIENDS,2019-02-21,4,The Great Miscommunication,"Let's start off with how this is a lovely property and a good place to stay for Hollywood.  There was a fair amount of miscommunication during our stay that brings out some frustrations.  Let me break it down to the pros and cons...

Pros - 
Location - right in Hollywood for all the touristy things to do.  Also, for our plans, it was not too far from Universal and LAX.  It was what we needed.   
Valet staff - they were all so kind and helpful
Housekeeping - friendly hellos
Staff overall - they tried to make it right and were friendly and tried to help when explained issues.
The Spare Room- actually was decent priced and offered free Bingo on Sunday night. It was a lovely lounge.
Great views from our 7th story room (TLC Chinese Theater, Hollywood sign, and Downtown LA).

Cons - 
Communication was limited -  here are three examples 
1) During our weekend stay, there was an Art exhibit at the hotel and the historic lobby was closed for a few hours.  All in all, no big deal.  However, either during check-in or an email prior to arrival would have been nice.  
2) At the Tropicana pool lounge our two drinks cost $42.  Looking at the receipt, there was a 15% service charge and then another 5% charge.  What the heck... that seems extreme, but i'm also all for giving a livable wage to employees so if that was the case, spell it out.
3) Complimentary coffee - they have a card in the room identifying they have complementary coffee in the lobby.  Apparently this only until 9am.  Why not indicate time, since there are no coffee makers in the rooms. When finding the coffee empty at 8:55am on Monday, we were told it is only until 9am, ""Isn't that too bad"".  

Extra prices all around - lots are tagged on, again I understand I'm in Hollywood, but I just want to know the why.",,3.0,5.0,,,,4.0,Manager-247,General Manager,2019-02-22,"Dear Elizaeth M,

Phylliskb,3,"Chicago, Illinois",2019-02-28,FAMILY,2019-02-19,1,Terrible hotel!,"We were a part of a wedding party that was staying at the Roosevelt.  About 50-60 rooms were taken by us. We were all paying the same rate and we all had different size rooms.  Some were very tiny and some were very generous.  No consistency of accommodations at all. My room did not have a full length mirror so I couldn’t check how I looked before I left. Other guests had a full length mirror.  

It is a very dark hotel.  The lobby does not have adequate lighting and the hallways are dark and dinghy. Very creepy. Light colors and neutral carpeting would be a big improvement. It is a beautiful hotel—- but you can’t see it.

The worst problem was an art show that was at the hotel.  The 1st day we were there, both elevators were being used by visitors to the art show.  It was impossible to get up or down without a 10-15 minute wait.  The 2nd day, 1 elevator was designated a hotel guest only elevator but every elevator was jammed packed. Apparently, a paying guest has the lowest priority.  

My son had requested a crib for his 18 month old daughter and they put it together but left the bottom off. When my granddaughter was put in the crib, the crib collapsed on her. Very unacceptable.  When my son called the front desk to tell them about it, the person who answered was unbelievably rude.  Obviously, additional training on proper and polite customer service needs to be given. There were numerous incident like this that occurred. 

When I return to LA, I certainly will NOT stay here again.",Pick another hotel.,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,,Manager-247,General Manager,2019-02-20,"Dear Philliskb,

We appreciate receiving your feedback. While the historic architecture of our hotel lends itself to our charm, it also prevents our rooms from being identical, even in similar room categories. We regret that the aesthetic of our decor didn't appeal to you and that another event at the hotel caused inconvenience waiting for the elevator. The guest service you describe is not reflective of the standard of service we strive for here at the Hollywood Roosevelt, and we wish you the best in any future travels.

tarekazoury,1,,2019-02-28,FAMILY,2019-02-18,1,Complete Trash,"This was the second time I stayed at this establishment, but as of my last stay, I can no longer call it an establishment but a ramshackle run down convention center. Costco has less going on than this train station of a hotel. Not only were there ten events happening at a time, between weddings, art fairs, snail racing, who the eff knows what else. The elevator wait time was over 30 minutes for each trip. When you asked the staff if there were stairs, they rudely and semi proudly boasted that there were no stairs. I asked if there was a fire what would happen, the safety warning reads “if you must evacuate”, like yeah if I’m stuck in a fire I “must evacuate”. That was one facet of this disastrous stay. When we wanted to turn the ac on a waft of French fries emanated through the vents. Not only did it smell worse than a burger king’s bathroom, actually burger king’s bathroom smells better, but when we asked the concierge about this bizarre circumstance, they failed to help us in any way. Next up, the shower. As much as I love to stand in a lagoon of my own filth every time I shower, I found myself almost going surfing in the shower rather than, showering. The waves that were created from the over flooding were over a foot tall. Not to mention that my towel has black stains on it…Anyways, if you want to wake up to the sweet smell of fried chicken, wait preposterous amounts of time to get to and from your room, and be greeted by staff whom I honestly think were less friendly than prison guards, please by all means, stay at this “establishment”. Oh not to mention, the lobby looks like someone was murdered in it. The pool is the only redeeming quality. Do yourself a favor and drown yourself. 

Let’s get into the amenities, or rather, lack there of. I think these towels were found in the rummage of hurricane Katrina. They were so hard, so dirty, and barely fit around my waist. They were fit for a toddler. We arrived to our quarters at 5 pm to a dirty and unserviced room, the concierge was so busy that they could not even answer the phone after calling 20 times in a row. As for room service, one would think this is a perk of staying at a hotel, but actually, room service was a disservice. The grilled cheese that I ordered was not grilled, but a stale piece of toast probably the size of my head smothered in cold, barely grilled cheese. The caesar salad looked so depressing, that we ate out of sheer famish and desperation than enjoyment. That is all my friends, stay here at your own risk.",,1.0,1.0,3.0,,,,Manager-247,General Manager,2019-02-19,"Dear tarekazoury,

We appreciate your candid feedback and your way with colorful descriptions but regret to know we failed you during your stay.

When we first checked in, the desk clerk asked if we wanted an upgrade to a larger room. We declined and said our small room would be fine. But upon seeing the room it was very small!!! We called down to the front desk and asked her if we could take her up on her upgrade offer. She moved us to the most amazing large corner room with a view of the Hollywood sign! Since we were attending a formal event, having this large space was wonderful. Also upon check-in, we met Mark who helped us with our luggage. He offered to show us around the hotel. He was amazing and it was so interesting to learn about the history of this fabulous hotel! He showed us the room where the first Oscars took place. He took us up to the rooftop deck and showed us the beautiful penthouse suite. He pointed out where a few movie scenes has been filmed and he showed us Marilyn Monroe’s suite where she lived for 2 years! We had such an amazing ‘Hollywood’ experience at this hotel.

Bill Paz the head of security was exceptionally knowledgeable, professional and personable.  He remembered us from our Wedding and graciously allowed us into the historic ballroom to take a photo were we had been married 1 year ago (where the very first Academy Award ceremonies were held nearly a century ago).
Bill’s knowledge of the hotel was fascinating and informative complete with many interesting stories of the hotels historic past. i.e.: Clark Gable, Marilyn Monroe etc...  We can’t say enough about Bill, he really made us feel special here at our favourite hotel.

Love it's location., They had easy valet service and no problem with parking my SUV. It is right across from the Dolby theater, lots of restaurants in walking distance. Hollywood stars are out the front door. Hollywood is full of wierdos so you have that on the street right outside. The room had an honor bar that I wouldn't touch for the price, you could get all the contents for that 1/2 block away at the CVS pharmacy store for the price of a hotel bag of M&M. They had a vegan impossible burger which was great for me. I feel like too many hotels either have lettuce or foo foo snacks for vegans, but the 25 degree bar had the vegan burger (best one) fries and other selections that made it nice. I didn't have to select a random Thai place to find something to eat. I recommend this place. Good food. good rest. even good hotel soap.",hollywood blvd is noisy so go higher in the hotel,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,,Manager-247,General Manager,2019-01-31,"Dear kyle30688,

The staff was friendly and helpful -- when we told them that the sink our room wasn't draining properly, they fixed it immediately.  And the valet was very quick (at $45/night, they should be) which is not the case at all hotels, so we were very pleased.  We stayed in the basic queen room, which is small but typical for an older hotel.  It was clean and well-appointed with up-to-date features.  They have mini bars in the rooms, which I like, but no coffee or tea which is a bit unusual.  The pool areas is lovely and the service by the pool was excellent.  He even pointed out that the gratuity was already included, which was nice.  The bed was fine, but not one of the great hotel beds that makes you want to get a new mattress when you return home.

Vlai,470,"Singapore, Singapore",2018-12-31,FAMILY,2019-01-20,3,The good and the bad,"We decided to spurge during our 2 weeks USA trip and stayed here for the last 3 nights in Hollywood blvd. 

We checked late on the arrival 19 December 2018. Room was upgraded to deluxe from standard room. The room was huge, could tell it was recently renovated. The room wasn’t clean and the rug was came loose, beware not to trip on it. 

We were pretty much enjoy the room and the hotel even it wasn’t as clean as it should be. Dust on the lamp, furniture, bathroom has stain at the corner but we can tolerate. Until the last night of our stay. We came back to the room 7 hours later to find out the room was not made. Too bad, we left the towels on the floors, so we requested for housekeeping. The guy on the phone was rude when we called him the second time to inform him we will be out while they clean the room. We wasn’t happy with his attitude and went to the reception, we were tired from all day walking around, the guy from the reception, Mr Brian, told us that the hotel didn’t clean the room every day, to our surprise and shocked, and when he called the house keeping again, they “blamed” us for putting the don’t disturb sign which we were not. We were out at 1pm, the do not disturb sign were gone, which meant the second shift of the house keeper skipped our room. Mr Brian knew he gave us wrong info (about not cleaning the room daily) and the house keeping pointed arrow to us, he very sincerely offered us free room service breakfast the next morning. We were happily accepted didn’t realize we have to pay usd27 for service charge and tax. That was not “complimentary” at all. Anyway, we were rushed for our tour and check out immediately the next morning. 

The bed was too large, the mattress was too small, this caused everyone of us knocked on the hard wood frame, and we all got bruises as a souvenir from the beds. 

No, we won’t come back. ",,,,,,,,Manager-247,General Manager,2019-01-22,"Greetings Vlai,

When checking in the pretty lady with the tattoos and the mixed chick with the dope nails greeted us and let us know about the hotel and things that were going on but all while still picking up the phones that just ring and ring (FYI not a good look). They did there best to politely put people on hold, when they finally were able to check our rooms in at least 5 people had been on hold! I seen a gentleman sitting at a desk when we arrived I assumed was concierge but found out you don’t have one, and your staff does that as well being in Hollywood and paying as much as 300 for a queen size bed I would expect to be paying for a concierge or at least free WiFi maybe even free coffee until 10am, every time I went 4 days straight no coffee and it took someone at least 40mins then one time I got there at almost 9 guest had already been waiting and then a gentleman comes and just pulls the coffee with no explanation other than it’s now after 9am speak with front desk! The hotel is very much in need of some changes! I also would like to inform you, you’re breaking the law by not having a ramp for handicap guest to use! Or just guest in general as you have them go up and down stairs with luggage and there is NEVER anyone standing  by the stairs just a group of gentlemen by the door or valet. I heard that the Hollywood Roosevelt is somewhere to party and let’s just say I was totally unhappy with this stay! The hotel is all over the place it’s like pick a theme and stick with it, are you a classic historic hotel or are you the party hotel everyone knows you as. But you can’t be both! Your hotel doesn’t even have a overall scent! All of our rooms and each floor smelled different. The Roosevelt is like a box of Chocolates you never what you’re gonna get!

Perry,20,"England, United Kingdom",2018-09-30,FAMILY,2019-01-17,3,"Historic Hotel, but have to say was let down!","We searched all day for a room in Hollywood, and my father suggested the Roosevelt- simply because of all of the historic people that have enjoyed themselves in this hotel.

We walked into a nice but awfully dark lobby and booked a room. I found the lifts dark as were the corridors. I felt quite unsafe when out in Hollywood in the early evening. We planned to stay for 2 nights but after having a look at Hollywood we decided we were going to move onto the Beverley Hills hotel as planned originally. So we went down and informed the lobby; they were lovely and changed it without questions, to just one night. I did like the fact you couldn't get into the lifts without a room key, so this step helped us feel a bit more secure in our room. 

We stopped in a Roosevelt suite. I can't fault the cleanliness of the room, but I didn't think the decor warranted the price paid for that one night in there. I understand it's newly refurbished but I can't help but feel the decor didn't feel luxurious as imagined for the price being paid. Luckily our room was high- if you were any lower I would imagine the noise from the strip would be extremely loud. We could only faintly hear it.

All of the staff we encountered were lovely and were the doormen. I'm glad to say that I did stop in there but unfortunately once was enough.",,,4.0,,5.0,,5.0,Manager-247,General Manager,2019-01-18,"Dear perry1320,

After checking in, I came back to the room to find that I couldn’t enter. They immediately sent someone up to fix the issue, and then the TV did not work. Again, they quickly resolved the issue. I ordered food later that evening, and on my way to the restaurant to pick up my order, I was informed by a staff member that I would have to exit the hotel to go to the restaurant because there was a private event taking place. After refusing (tiny woman, 10:00pm in Hollywood), I was walked by security to get my food. 

They did also end up moving us to a cabana suite which was amazing, but it was so loud due to drunk guests, we had a horrible nights sleep. We are awoken three separate times, and the walls are very very thin. Internet and parking are also astronomically expensive. It’s a classic, beautiful hotel but I can’t say I’d return.

Tobias J,9,,2019-01-31,COUPLES,2019-01-07,2,Not my cup of tea.,"TLDR; No, I can't recommend this hotel. Will not revisit. Here's why:

Firstly. I sent these complaints to the hotel 5 days ago, but they haven't returned. Which frustrates me.

Okay, so here's why I wouldn't recommend this hotel:

1. 10 minutes after we got to our room we were interrupted by a (friendly, I have to say) employee who was responsible for restocking the mini bar. I think these type of tasks should be done before the room is ready for new guests and not after the new guests have arrived… We got a feeling that the room has been prepared in a rush and not properly... Which brings us to number 2….

2. Cleaning. We found hair from a previous guest in the bathtub/shower. Felt quite disgusted by it actually. Of course, we could have called the manager and asked for another room/extra cleaning but we were tired after a long day of travelling.

3. On checkout day one of the elevators were broken. No notice could be found on our floor about this. And the only working elevator was constantly full so we had to wait for approx 10-15 minutes before we could take the elevator down and check out. 

4. Only one line/person on duty in the reception around 10 AM resulted in additional waiting time.

For me, some of the most basic ”rules” for staying at a hotel is that you should not be unnecessarily interrupted/disturbed, have clean rooms and a smooth experience upon checkout. The hotel didn't live up to that.

Also: Hollywood Boulevard is in the middle of everything. If you like a lot of tourists, souvenirs, strange food, panhandlers etc you will enjoy it. We didn't.",,,1.0,,4.0,4.0,,Manager-247,General Manager,2019-01-08,"Dear guest,

Dale A,168,"Burlington, Canada",2018-08-31,NONE,2019-01-04,3,Nice hotel... for the party crowd,"The hotel itself is stunning. The architecture and history here is second to none. The room was a pool view which had a nice balcony, a retro feel to the decor and was a great size. You feel like you are in a very nice hotel with a good staff. These rooms would not be suitable for families. The pool is the center of everything including the parties that will have music going until 2am. I was fine with that but it would be too loud for the average person. My room was also beside the housekeeping closet which had staff going in and out all morning, talking and banging around. Too early, especially since you will be up after 2am with the music playing. All the rooms in that area would have heard this. The restaurants were good and not overly busy. The lobby is a great spot for a drink or meeting people. I've stayed at all the big Hollywood hotels. Given the party atmosphere though, I can't recommend this hotel for most people.",,,,,,,,Manager-247,General Manager,2019-01-07,"Dear DaleA130,

MNguy123,57,"Zurich, Switzerland",2019-01-31,BUSINESS,2019-01-03,3,not what I expected.,"I was somewhat surprised by my experience given all the positive reviews.  This is a historic hotel right in the heart of the action in Hollywood.  My room was incredibly small, and you couldn't open the bathroom door without banging into the wall, and the sink protruded over the toilet.  The shower was hard to turn on, as you had to lean in and around a glass panel and would get sprayed if you didn't realize the lever was set for the shower rather than the tub.  There were no towels in the room, and the phone didn't work without plugging and jiggling the line.  The lobby is beautiful, but showing wear and tear.  The same was true for the room, it was showing signs of wear and tear, and layed out in an awkward manner. Staff were friendly and responded quickly to requests, which was helpful.  Check in and check out was smooth.  I wouldn't be opposed to staying there again, but for the same price, I have stayed at other hotels in Hollywood that are nicer and more comfortable.",,,4.0,,,2.0,3.0,Manager-247,General Manager,2019-01-04,"Greetings MNguy123,

LovinHotelLife,549,,2018-12-31,FAMILY,2018-12-28,4,Much improved since last visits,"I have been staying at The Roosevelt for the last 8 years. During which time I've had many good stays and many bad stays. It seems that under the new hotel group they finally have their act together.

Firat off, things are shockingly expensive here. A single 16 oz. domestic draft beer will set you back $11 before tip. However, on Christmas eve, they offered free holiday movies in the theater to guests along with free hot chocolate, christmas cookies, popcorn and honey roasted cashews. Nice to see that they do cool stuff like this.

The rooms are decorated SO much better than they previously were with a soothing (although somewhat jail cell-like) grey pattern and beautiful drapery. The bathrooms also have been upgraded with a grey marble, rainfall showerhead and nicely scented bath products.

The staff here is the only thing about the hotel which lets on service is merely going through the motions. Mostly young, tattooed kids in their 20's who cannot help you with much. There were no service stars to give out during any of our interactions. In fact, days before our stay I made one request, that the two rooms I booked were on the same floor. Upon checking in, they were on two different floors and I was told that there was no note attached to the reservation, as stated.

The common areas are amazing ... so historic and Old Hollywood in appearance. Most times, you are asked just once if you want a drink whereas in the past drinks were constantly pushed.

The pool is beautiful. During the day there are terry cloth lounge chairs while at night the pool is heated to 80+ degrees making it feel like bathwater. Oddly, it closes at 7 pm which feels a bit early.

The rooms I'd recommend are the Cabana Rooms as those are newly and luxuriously decorated. The regular rooms are nice but some can be very small which a studio suite or above is probably a better choice.

Overall, some setbacks. But for the most part its the only hotel in Hollywood I'd recommend for tourists, business or family. It will give you that old hollywood vibe.",,,,,,,,Manager-247,General Manager,2018-12-31,"Hello LovinHotelLife,

JL1026,121,"Orlando, Florida",2018-10-31,COUPLES,2018-12-28,3,Nothing terribly exciting,"Stayed here on a trip to LA in October. Wanted to be in the heart of everything and it definitely lives up to that. Located on the walk of fame and across the street from the Grauman's Chinese Theatre.

When we checked in they gave us a room fairly quickly. We got into our room and it reeked of smoke. We called the front desk who let us know there wasn't another room available at that time but they could send us down an air purifier. We had a tour we had to get to so we asked they send it down. We never received said air purifier and it never came to the room the whole trip.

The hotel was busy and there was a party going on in the lobby. We were right by the pool so it was very active and loud. I would say if you don't want to be awake all night to request a room not near the pool. 

It definitely felt like a Hollywood experience and the hotel is very beautiful. But I think it just depends on what you want and your expectations. I found the staff to not be friendly and it felt like the hotel took themselves a little too seriously. For the amount of money we spent I would not stay again.

The bed had a canopy as seen in pictures and was quite comfortable. 

Location was good. The Chinese Theatre is just across the street. Hollywood highlands is also very near.

Sue K,4,"Los Angeles, California",2018-12-31,COUPLES,2018-12-25,5,AMAZING HOTEL/INCREDIBLE SERVICE AND LOCATION,"Even though I live in Los Angeles, I surprised my husband by booking a room in The Hollywood Roosevelt for his birthday.  We were seeing a Magic Show in their ""hidden"" theater (It was incredible, but will get its own review). The arrangements to do this became very complicated and difficult due to my husband's schedule. The staff at this incredible, historic hotel could not do enough for me.  From the person, Rachel who took my reservation on the phone and arranged something special for his birthday. I did not ask for them, but she made sure that there were amazing chocolate covered strawberries and special Evian water, all  complementary from the hotel. That day, I ran to the hotel with a suitcase so when we finally arrived in the room after the show, everything would be there.  Raphie in the parking lot and Mark, the amazing Bell Captain Manager, helped (despite my protests that I could do it myself and without expecting anything in return), to get me settled and in and out of there quickly so my husband would not wonder why I had disappeared on his birthday. I took the suitcase there way before check-in time, but the wonderful front desk staff invited me to use the room and leave stuff there.  Perfect!  What a beautiful room, huge, in the tower.  It was like a suite and I had booked the most reasonable room in the hotel.  Because this is a beautiful and historical hotel, we decided to take a self tour of it,  We could not find all the places we wanted to see so two employees, at separate times, who were making sure that the lobby and public areas were clean (so clean, you could have eaten off the floor), actually stopped what they were doing to make sure that we could find our way. Then we relaxed by the pool with its wonderful lounges and wait staff. Again, outstanding service.  The management of this hotel is most certainly doing something right!!! The location of the hotel is perfect. It is right across the street from the mall at Hollywood and Highland, Grauman's Chinese Theater (now called the TCL) with hand prints/foot prints of the famous, across from Madame Tussauds Wax Museum, and down the block from the Egyptian Theater, Ripley's Believe It or Not, good restaurants and many other things to see.

Bob M,6,"Swedesboro, New Jersey",2018-11-30,FAMILY,2018-12-03,5,Hospitality defined,"We stayed for 6 days in November.  From the minute we were dropped off at the hotel, we were treated like VIPs.  Our cab driver was having problems with his credit card machine and The Bell Captain, Mark Rader jumped right in to rectify the situation.  He made sure the Bell Men were careful with our bags while personally escorted us to check-in.  While waiting for our room, he took us for a tour of the hotel and introduced us to key personnel that we ended up interacting with throughout our stay.  Once our room was ready, we were pleasantly surprised to find that it faced the Chinese Theater with a view of the Hollywood sign.  The room was spotless with nostalgic decor, lots of light, comfortable beds and one of the best stocked mini-bars we have ever seen.  Throughout our stay, Mark was an ever-present friendly face, offering us helpful and useful guidance on everything from attractions, traffic, transportation and most importantly, the best food in town; some of which happens to be in the hotel itself.  The hotel has charm galore.  Walking through the main lobby, it’s easy to imagine Marilyn Monroe sitting at the bar, the pool area is truly fit for movie stars and the bars and restaurants are tasteful Hollywood, not gaudy Hollywood.  

I can’t say enough about the location.  Since we were traveling with our two teenage boys, we spent two days at Universal Studios.  Again, Mark Rader came to the rescue and suggested taking the Metro rather than dealing with LA traffic.

Hotel is a short walk from the Chinese Theatre. We were there whilst a film premiere was on and the AFI which made the hotel very busy! We saw Sarah Silverman in the lift.

Lovely pool and enjoyed the breakfast from the bar at the front of the hotel. The Hotel staff were lovely and helpful.

This hotel has lots of history and the building inside is stunning with a lot of features.

Anyone travelling to LA for the first time will know that there is a lot to see which is spread around. The hop on off bus starts outside the Chinese Theatre (We bought a 48hr ticket) and the metro is there also. We used Uber too.",,,,,,,,Manager-247,General Manager,2018-11-28,"Greetings Leona S,

Sophie W,11,"Sydney, Australia",2018-05-31,COUPLES,2018-11-27,3,Good location - overall ok,"Stayed in May 2018 for 4 nights. Overall it is ok - nothing to write home about and we probably would not stay again but did enjoy our few nights. 

When we first arrived our room STANK of marijuana. We gave it about 6 hours after checking in and then called concierge that night to let them know. Our response ""What do you want me to do, it's legal here now. You want a room change or what?"" - All I was asking for was some room spray to help. When the cleaner arrived they made a comment of how bad the smell was. 

Rooms are pretty basic but comfortable. We did have a great view over the pool. Enjoyed our time down by the pool bar - although the service leaves you feeling a bit cold. 

Can get loud with the nightlife aspect but the staff did warn us of this in advance. It quietens down at about 1am. 

We enjoyed a night at the upstairs bar with the bowling alley!",View of the pool is lovely although can come with some noise.,,4.0,4.0,,,4.0,Manager-247,General Manager,2018-11-27,"Greetings sophwall123,

First of all the bathroom is way too small and the toilet can barely fit an infant. Secondly the room itself is fine for one or two people, but not meant for anymore people. Thirdly, the carpet feels like sandpaper but you can deal with it. Now for some good things? Its located in the middle of Hollywood Boulevard and has some nice views.

After my 11 hour flight I decided to book an in room massage which was just perfect. I had a Queen superior room, it was Snug but with it being just me it was perfect with the most gorgeous bedding and comfy bed and Quiet room! Love the idea of pre order room service i used this the first night ready for when I got up! Ricardo was brilliant and when I needed a good cup of Breakfast tea between 3/4 he was up with it in minutes of me calling. There’s also a great complimentary service in the lobby from around 5 each morning with Tea and Coffee. Ate at Tropicana for Breakfast and at 25 Degrees. Watched Sun rises and Sun sets round the pool and one night enjoyed some bubbles in Teddy’s. Nice touch at checkout while waiting for my car I was given a bottle of water for my journey to the airport. I have been back in the U.K. a Day and can’t wait to book again! It will always be my go to Hotel now in LA for both Business and Pleasure.

Civillit1,148,"Bakersfield, California",2018-11-30,COUPLES,2018-11-16,2,"Visit for the nostalgia, leave for everything else","As always, the good, the bad and the ugly

THE GOOD
The hotel is a nostalgic Art Deco hotel that harkens back to the days of Hollywood’s Golden Age. And for that alone it’s worth a visit. From the beginning of the visit, everything felt a bit amiss.  

We started great with Tesla Car charging available at no cost and a valet that was helpful and efficient. The front desk was a bit cool, but sadly that’s where the trouble started.

THE BAD
First we waited 45 minutes to get our bags. Next we immediately realized the pool cabana room (106) was nothing more than a regular bottom floor room that gave sliding door access to a tired, rundown pool area with a staff that could barely be bothered to acknowledge your presence, let alone get you a drink. 

The room, strangely has all furniture built for easy access for toddlers. The bed is about 18 inches off the ground. We felt like we were back in college sleeping on a futon. With mold on the shower ceilings and holes in the walls, it didn’t feel like a $439.00 per night room. It was more a Motel 6 with history.

THE UGLY
The noise was unbearable. Literally the entire night you could hear every passing conversation; Every door slam. Couldn’t sleep much because it never stopped. All night!

Then you run into the bar staff! From the main bar in the lobby to the event staff working the Premiere Party we were there to attend, the attitude was horrific! They were all just simply too talented and too special to work here. They ignored virtually everyone while laughing among themselves. A glass of wine took 22 minutes to obtain from the main bar that was no busier than any Applebee’s on a Tuesday night. 

We stayed here because this was close to the premiere and it hosted the after party. Come in and buy a long awaited cocktail, check out the lobby and leave. The Stay simply wasn’t memorable for anything good!",,,,,,,,Manager-247,General Manager,2018-11-19,"Dear Civillit1,

We're glad to know you appreciated the nostalgia we embody, harkening back to Hollywood's Golden Age, and it was an honor to have you with us for your premiere event. We're sorry, however, that you didn't feel the warmth of our hospitality during your stay, as what you describe is not typical of a Hollywood Roosevelt experience. We'd love to welcome you back to leave a better impression, perhaps situating you in one of our quieter tower rooms for a better night's rest.

Redfers,77,"Newmarket, United Kingdom",2018-10-31,FRIENDS,2018-11-13,5,Short two night stay,"Arrived mid-evening after a difficult day of travelling. Was given a loft king room on the 10th floor, if I recall
The hotel is just a stone's throw away from the Chinese Theatre so is in the heart of Hollywood, but is peaceful inside 
Very pleasant room. Two bathrooms, 1 with a shower another with a bath with shower over. Toilet in both. Walk in wardrobe. Luggage storage room. Everything you could want. Well stocked mini-bar with some quirky items and reasonably priced, so it was used. The bed was very comfortable. Only slight gripe would be that it was quite dark in the room. There were no main ceiling lights, so it was just lit by a few lamps. Looking for things required a torch, but that is only a minor issue.
Reception was very friendly and efficient as was the valet parking staff. The lobby had complimentary coffee available for breakfast, which was welcome. 
The lobby was impressive, but was closed off for a private reception for a few hours on the second night. Loads of security staff protecting the A list guests. It was a sight to see
Had a burger and drinks in 25 Degrees, which was a decent burger and efficient if not over friendly service. Checked out The Spare Room and The Public bars as well. Everywhere was busy, but it was a weekend. Took a look at the pool, but didn't have time to spend there as it was only a short, but very pleasant stay.",I requested a higher floor and it was quiet with great views,,4.0,5.0,,,5.0,Manager-247,General Manager,2018-11-13,"Dear Redfers,

Paul N,21,"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",2018-11-30,NONE,2018-11-10,3,The Golden Age isn't worth this much gold,"This is a gorgeous deco space, steeped in nostalgia for Hollywood's hey-day of the '30s-'50s. But enjoy it by having a drink in one of the bars or by the pool; a stay here is not worth the money. We spent three nights here, and I wish we hadn't. Each night, there was an event of some sort, and many of the public spaces, including the main-floor lobby, we're off-limits to hotel guests. For a spot on what is now a fairly sketchy stretch of Hollywood Blvd., we were charged $49.50 for one night of parking. Our room was tiny, and the space was completely taken up by a king-size four-poster bed. The air-conditioning didn't work and required a call to maintenance to repair. The elevator system requires a room key to operate, and it was often balky, requiring guests to try each other's keys to get from floor to floor. When we checked out, the bill was $150 higher than our confirmed-in-advance price, and it took the efforts of two reception clerks to finally get us the price we were promised. Marilyn Monroe may have spent a year here; 90 minutes would be enough for me.",,,,,,,,Manager-247,General Manager,2018-11-13,"Greetings paulnussbaum30,

JulianHGS,48,"Stockport, United Kingdom",2018-10-31,COUPLES,2018-11-10,5,Lovely hotel in the heart of Hollywood,"We caught the Flyaway bus from just outside the arrivals hall at LAX, which departs at quarter past every hour to and from Vine Street in Hollywood. The journey is 1 hour and costs just $8 each, which is paid at the end of the journey but must be by card. There is then a 30 mins walk along Hollywood Boulevard and Walk of Fame to the hotel, which is located in the centre opposite the Chinese Theatre and ‘H&H’ mall. Alternatively you can catch the metro to Union Station, then change to Hollywood & Highland station, very close to the hotel. 

You enter the hotel into the lovely lobby and bar area. Check in/reception is situated one floor down from there, where you can also find the entrance to the outdoor pool and bar. The Public Kitchen restaurant off from the lobby is nice but very expensive. 25 Degrees at the front of the hotel (serving beer, burgers, fries etc) is much cheaper in comparison. 11% tax is added to bills/checks everywhere in Hollywood/LA, plus a minimum 15% ‘discretionary’ tip is expected.

We booked a superior room with queen bed, but were upgraded by the hotel to a junior suite on the 15th floor overlooking Chinese Theatre, Hollywood Boulevard and the Hollywood sign - and we thank the hotel very much for this lovely kind gesture. The room was very big, with a king size 4-poster bed, but only a very small bathroom and toilet area, which was strange. Room has bathrobes, safe, air con and minibar, but not tea, coffee or free water, although the tap water is drinkable. Tea and coffee is provided in the lobby each morning, but only until it runs out, which can be as early as 8.30! Free wifi is only available in the lobby area, otherwise costs $15 per day. There are no additional ‘resort fees’ to pay at this hotel.

Places to go to in the immediate area are Griffith Observatory (by taxi), Universal City Walk (by metro) and walk along Sunset Boulevard. Can get the hop on hop off bus which travels around Beverley Hills and along Sunset and Santa Monica Boulevards and Melrose Avenue etc.  Make sure you get off at the Original Farmers Market & The Grove which is lovely to walk around and eat / drink. There are separate routes to Santa Monica and downtown (there are only office blocks and hotels downtown and not much else to see as a tourist).

Other places to visit (by metro) are the California Science Museum (to see the space shuttle Endeavour), Long Beach (to see the Queen Mary), and Santa Monica, where you can go on the pier and walk around the pedestrianised shopping area on 3rd Street. Find Ye Olde Kings Head English style pub and restaurant, on the corner of Santa Monica Boulevard and 2nd Street. We hired bikes (from Santa Monica Beach Cycle Rentals – only $15 all day) and really enjoyed cycling along the seafront to Venice beach, Venice canals, muscle beach and Marina Del Ray.",,5.0,4.0,,,5.0,,Manager-247,General Manager,2018-11-13,"Dear JulianHGS,

The Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel has shifted to a modern, boutique vibe and somehow this was accomplished in a way that preserves, respects, and celebrates its rich, historical past.  Our Cabana Garden Room was great with a beautiful private outdoor bed on a walled-in patio/deck. The room itself had stylish furniture and an amazing, premium bed and linens that we wanted to take with us!  Beautiful robes, etc.  The staff is professional, very kind, and amazing.  The common areas feature the stylish luxe finishes of Old Hollywood set in a modern space.  The Tropicana Pool area is spacious and stylish, as well.  The event services are outstanding - planning and staffing are perfection!  24/7 Gym AND Room Service - always great!!! There were a few minor things that at this price point should never happen (these small details are why I did not grant this hotel a 5 rating) the ice machines are very old and the face piece of one of them fell off and landed at my husband's feet.  He had to visit 3 machines before he found the one that worked, some of the wear is apparent in places throughout the sleeping room areas and should be walked through and minor adjustments made more frequently.  The common areas are so great - everything should be held up to that standard.  Finally the Host/Waiter at Teddy's Bar was the only staff member that we encountered with a somewhat negative/snobby attitude.  Granted, Teddy's was very crowded because of the special event the other options were not open.  Maybe he was just stressed.  Since we are locals, we knew other good food options nearby.   I would recommend The Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel to anyone who loves Hollywood with its legends and its sometimes harsh realities.  It is beautiful right in the midst of a very urban environment.  It is ideal for a special event - I can't recommend that aspect enough!

Giggida,54,,2018-11-30,COUPLES,2018-11-03,4,Good but lacked some of the little things ,"We chose to stay at the Roosevelt to chill at the end of a month long trip in the states.  
Pros:
- lovely staff, lobby and old charm  
- pool was beautiful and very relaxing 
- clean and well stocked mini bar 
- close to Universal and other Hollywood sights 
Cons:
- Our room (a king size) was absolutely tiny with a four poster bed that blocked some of the view of the tv. 
- ridiculous room wifi fee when it’s offered free in the lobby to anyone! Why wouldn’t guests get wifi included?
- not many nice restaurants or bars in the area

We stayed in a superior king, which was roomy and had a nice layout. I wish we were on a higher floor, with a better view, but that's OK. Everything was otherwise perfect. So many great places to hang out in the hotel, starting with the lobby! Then there's also the pool, a cute lunch spot (feels like old Hollywood) off of the lobby and charming bar with a bowling alley!
I don't know why anyone would complain about the staff; I thought everyone -- from front desk reception to cleaning staff -- was exemplary. In the middle of all kinds of craziness, but it's serene in the hotel. We went for a walk to Runyon Canyon, which was about a 10 minute walk away. The hotel even has maps of the park and a Front Desk gal gave me advice about what trails to take.

We were scrambling to find a place to stay for our quick in and out one night stay. Prices at the nice hotels in the area were extremely high and we were unimpressed with the smaller boutique hotels. We remembered our very wonderful stay at The Roosevelt two years ago over New Years. We had one of our best hotel experiences ever which helped us overlook the high price for a one night stay and we booked with you. We were not disappointed and really enjoyed our short but sweet stay while enjoying our favorite band “Slash/Myles Kennedy”. The room was tiny but very nice and perfect for a short stay. Food and service by the pool was excellent. We had a late night after concert dinner at 25 degrees which was fun and great food. I am a pilot at United Airlines and have been stayed in countless hotels for 32 years. Yours definitely falls in the very top of my list and more importantly, we will be back!!

We arrived way before check-in and were grateful when they promptly checked us into our room. It was a small room with not much of a view, but I couldn't really complain... I was in Hollywood!

First I want to give a shout out to Ross, the bellhop. He made a wonderful impression on us, not only because he was from Sydney like we are, but because of his friendliness and willingness to answer any questions we had. He made us feel at home. Thank you Ross!

There were celebrity events on every night we were there which was kind of exciting, but we did not see much, as security was very high. 

Overall, I was very happy with the location. Okay so Hollywood is not as glamorous as you may imagine, but for me that's what adds to the character of the place. It was close to good restaurants and right across the road from Grauman's Chinese Theatre.

On the last day, the pool was closed off because of interviews they were conducting (Jeff Bridges and Dakota Johnson, if I recall correctly) they allowed access to the rooftop. We checked out (as we were leaving for Disneyland that day) and enjoyed a free buffet lunch and alcoholic beverage...not to mention the awesome view of Hollywood. It was an unforgettable experience and I'm not sure if rooftop access is always allowed, but if you get the chance to go up there... take it!

Overall the staff were very friendly and accommodating and I recommend the hotel for its good location too.

mrstraveller1,1631,"York, United Kingdom",2018-10-31,FAMILY,2018-10-24,4,"Historic, Slightly Odd Hotel in Central Location","We chose the hotel due to its location close to the touristy sights, most particularly Universal Studios. Various other landmarks such as the Walk of Fame & Chinese Theatre are literally on the doorstep. The immediate vicinity is grubby & tacky with more then it’s fair share of hobo’s & fruitcakes. It’s also noisy & we were disturbed both by the din from revellers on the street & the hammering beat of partying within the hotel. The hotel was built in 1926 & is famed for its glamorous Golden Era of Hollywood past, Marilyn Monroe lived here for a couple of years & the first Academy Awards were held here in 1929. The glamour has faded somewhat & we found the hotel worn, dated & rather rakish in feel. It’s dark, cavernous & just a little bit bizarre. Rooms have had a recent renovation but the retro styling just adds to the time warp feel. Our suite was huge & included an 8 man dining table yet the bathroom was poky. Very comfortable beds & quality linens though. Staff were friendly & efficient throughout & everything worked. The hotel has various bars & restaurants - breakfast at 25 Degrees was ok, dinner in Public Kitchen pretty good though we were freezing cold due to air con being set to Arctic.

Jenny,10,"San Francisco, California",2017-12-31,COUPLES,2018-10-19,5,Consistent and comfortable!,"My boyfriend and I have stayed here three times now, and every time we can count on it being clean and comfortable with great service. I used to live in LA, so for me it's actually a negative to be right on Hollywood Blvd, but the location is great even if you're not a tourist since it's central to so many other parts of town. We spend most of our time in the Los Feliz/Silverlake area when we're there, and it's just a quick fifteen minute drive or so (yes, this is quick by LA driving terms). 

We've stayed in a King Deluxe twice and a King Loft Suite once. Both room formats are great and spacious. I love that the rooms are updated but still keep the old charm. I do wish that there was a way they could make the bathrooms bigger, but it would probably take some major engineering, so I'll accept it as is. I love the top of the line toiletries (used to be Davines and was Maison Margiela more recently--not sure what it is right this second, but we are going next month!). The bed is always comfortable. One year we were there for our anniversary, and they had a plate of delicious dessert bites waiting in the room when we got there! 

We've never eaten in the main hotel restaurant (seriously there are just way too many other amazing options for food in LA), but we've gotten cocktails every trip at both the lobby bar and the other one that's tucked away in the corner. Both are great and a fun place to sit and do some people watching. 

Any time you're trying a new hotel in a big city that has any kind of focus on nightlife, I think it's worth it to call the hotel and find out what type of room you should reserve to take advantage of a quiet night's sleep. The first time we stayed at the Roosevelt, I did just that and they said to stay away from the cabana rooms by the pool (which have the noise from the bar there until early-morning hours) and recommended the Deluxe King since they're typically higher in the tower and away from most of the noise. So far, it's been quiet every time!","If you want a quiet room, go with the Deluxe King (typically higher in the main tower)!

Mike C,2,,2018-08-31,BUSINESS,2018-10-18,5,Quality & Loyalty,"I’ve been staying at The Roosevelt for 10+ years mostly for business trips. It’s rare that you find a high quality boutique hotel brand that stays true to their culture and identity.

The most important and valuable thing that has brought me back over and over is the focus on customer loyalty. They’ve been keeping track of my visits and my spending power at their hotel. They treat me with respect and make me feel like a regular as if I was part of a private membership community.

I’ve enjoyed seeing staff still employed there after 10 years and those familiar faces goes a long way, as if your part of a family. I feel safe, secure and that VIP feeling that while I’m there they will take care of me. My advice to management is to continue to focus on customer loyalty.

Take care of loyal customers, use good technology to know as much as possible about your repeat visitors and think about what you can do to keep them coming back. Complimentary check in beverage can go a long way. Advanced poolside seating reservation. General discounts, exclusive event access, etc. Continue to offer quality in room products and even consider one time special gifts for those special customers.

franskininio,79,"Manchester, United Kingdom",2018-10-31,COUPLES,2018-10-14,4,Vintage beauty,"Brilliant location and wonderfully historic building, very art deco. View from the room of the Hollywood walk of fame and the Chinese theater what more could you want? Room was small ish but understandable in a city location. Bathroom and bedding was lovely and clean. Hotel is within walking distance to many landmarks and a 10 minute drive to universal studios. Pillows were feather and flattened really easily so painful for our necks. Air conditioning unit was noisy also. Valet parking is $45 per night and staff are slow at bringing you your car when you can literally see it in the car park. No coffee in the room and stated complimentary coffee is offered in the lobby daily but you'd have to be down there before 10am to even get a look at it which I thought was poor.",,,,,,,,Manager-247,General Manager,2018-10-15,"Hello franskininio,

Thank you for gifting us with your thorough review and high score! We're glad our Hollywood location suited you so well, placing you in the heart of the action.

juliet k,40,"San Francisco, California",2018-10-31,NONE,2018-10-13,5,Awesome Rooms and Customer Service,"My daughter and I stayed at the Hollywood Roosevelt as it was next to the Jimmy Kimmel show .  I normally stay in Santa Monica but wanted to do something a bit different.
There are so many positives about the Roosevelt including:
--great customer service.  We were upgraded to a king lot on the 10th floor.  View of Graumann's, the Hollywood Hills and
Downtown LA was amazing
-beautiful room with a nod to the history of the hotel but contemporary in feel.
-bellmen/valet were super nice.  Gave us water when we got into the car and carried bags, etc.
-Sebastien at the front desk recommended some real interesting restaurants that were not the usual suspects.
-Sherman (not sure of his name) went above and beyond by getting me two cups of coffee even though the the complimentary coffee time frame was over (should go beyond 9:00 on weekdays).

Loved the fact that there is so much history at the hotel.  With so little history in LA that is still intact I LOVED that aspect.

Hollywood Blvd is a bit sketch but you drive everywhere in LA anyway so that really doesn't make much difference.

Will definitely stay at the Hollywood Roosevelt in the future.",,,,,,,,Manager-247,General Manager,2018-10-15,"Greetings juliet k,

Jeffrey B,37,"Toronto, Canada",2018-08-31,FAMILY,2018-10-04,4,Family review,"Travelled with my 12 year old nephew for 4 days and I really enjoyed this hotel. It’s an older hotel but they maintain the property very well. The rooms are very small but that’s what you would expect from an older hotel. It was also very clean. There where only a few small things I never likes about my room. There is no drawers to store cloths, just a small closet, the room is already small enough but they where about to put a cabinet in the room which took up a lot of space and I couldn’t even use it because it was filled with products to purchase, I felt like there was a confidence store in my room, which was not a good feel. I also wanted to use the fridge but it was filled with liquor which again I had to purchase if I wanted it. So if you have kids be sure to watch them and make sure they don’t grab anything off the cabinet.
One reason I thought this hotel was good for family’s is that it’s right on the boulevard and universal studios was very close. I also went to Santa Monica beach which was just over 20 dollars for an Uber which wasn’t bad for the distance.
A small complaint I have is that one day I came back from a long day of walking to find that there was only one elevator working. The hotel closed one of the elevator for a private party on the penthouse and no guest where allowed to use it except the party guest. The other elevator took forever because people where constantly using it and it would never go the bottom floor , just the main lobby mostly, eventually it would go to the bottom but we had already waited a long time. Every guest should be treaty equally, doesn’t matter if your having a party or your a hotel guest, this made me feel I was second. Normally something like this would bother me but I just felt like I wasn’t important.",,,,,,,,Manager-247,General Manager,2018-10-05,"Greetings Jeffrey,

We appreciate your candid review and high rating! We're glad to know that you and your nephew found a home with us here in Hollywood for your visit, and agree that the convenience to family-friendly attractions such as Universal and Santa Monica is ideal. It sounds as though you took full advantage of our prime location! We are sorry, however, to learn of the inconveniences you experienced. We value our guests in the highest regard, so we're dismayed to note that you felt overlooked when an event in the hotel took precedence over your needs. While we are a central part of the Hollywood scene, we are first and foremost a welcoming landing place for all our guests, and we hope for the chance to host you again to show you an even more authentic experience.

CurlyHongKong,58,,2018-08-31,COUPLES,2018-10-03,1,The only thing good about this hotel was the lobby,"So you get into this hotel and you are greeted by the most beautiful lobby and rooms on the ground floor. You are really excited and then you check in and go to your room and its  utterly awful. 
The rooms in the pictures look great but there are various significant issues. Firstly the tiny bathrooms are just impossible to deal with, and the bathroom door looked like it was last maintained in the 60's 
Secondly, even though we asked for a quiet room there was no soundproofing whatsoever and my wife who is very sensitive couldn't sleep at all meaning that I couldn't either. Whilst the location was very noisy, it was the internal soundproofing which was the problem and this is really inexcusable.
The hotel also charged for wifi which was not acceptable at this price bracket. It would be fine in a budget hotel but given the price it was a joke. It also charged for water and didn't provide slippers. Again, in the US this isn't rare, but it is in a hotel of this supposed calibre. The hotel also charged for valet parking without offering self parking as an option. Not too much of a problem, but still felt crazy at these prices.
 So it is a hotel with great history, but utterly pointless to stay in unless your idea of a nice stay is an all night party....",,1.0,3.0,1.0,,,,Manager-247,General Manager,2018-10-04,"Hello CurlyHongKong,

SRGsally,15,"Woodstock, Georgia",2018-09-30,FRIENDS,2018-10-02,4,Nice historic property but expensive,"I chose this hotel and splurged because it was right on Hollywood Blvd and I loved all the history behind it.  The valet service is very efficient and personable.  Our room was not ready but they checked our luggage and called us when the room was ready to occupy.  The room and bathroom looked small online but it was actually quite nice and cozy.  We were promised a 10th floor room with a view of Hollywood Blvd which was important to me because of the extremely high cost of the room.  We did get a 10th floor room but our ""view"" was through a window on the side of the hotel and we only a tiny view of the Chinese theater.  Not what I was expecting (a full on view of the street).  The hotel has plenty of character and is beautiful if a bit meandering.  The pool was too crowded with a young adult crowd so we were never able to use it.  Overall, I'm glad to have experienced staying at the Roosevelt but I think it was overpriced to spend $750 for 2 nights.",,,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,Manager-247,General Manager,2018-10-03,"

My only complaint- the late night music at the pool: I could understand doing this on a Friday or Saturday night, but I really wasn’t expecting to hear music that loud at 2.30 in the morning midweek.

roger s,4,,2018-09-30,FRIENDS,2018-09-18,5,The only hotel I’ll stay at in Los Angeles,"Had a birthday trip planned to Los Angeles and wanted to stay at The Hollywood Roosevelt. I stayed there a few years ago and loved it. From the moment you walk through the front door you are treated like a celebrity. The staff genuinely seems happy you are there. 

The history of this classic hotel is amazing and I frequently stopped and thought of all the people who have been here. The room was amazing. I loved all of the black and white photos in the halls. I spent two afternoons lounging by the pool. I’ve had an array of experiences at other luxury hotels, but this was one my best. Again it comes back to staff and you couldn’t ask for any better. The bartenders at all the spots were knowledgeable and professional. 

I struck up a conversation with Chris from security. While he was obviously working he took the time to speak with us and answer any of our questions. We saw him multiple times during our stay and he always stopped to make sure we were having a great stay. I always wanted to go on the rooftop to have a picture with the iconic sign in the background and also enjoy the city views from above. I told Chris it was birthday and he made it happen. The staff was excellent, but Chris made an already enjoyable stay one to remember. 

Los Angeles has numerous places to stay, but for me there’s only one, The Hollywood Roosevelt.",,,,,,,,,,,,2
keithx1,64,"Brisbane, Australia",2018-09-30,COUPLES,2018-09-17,1,dont judge a book by its cover,I had stayed here over 30 years ago and had fond memories of my time here so I thought I would stay here again with my wife as she had not experienced The Hollywood Roosevelt and the room was great so was the position of the Hotel and most of the service. The reason I gave this an ovall rating of one is because when we first got to the hotel to drop our bags and check in we had the unfortunate experience of meeting the Vallate parking man named Raffe this man was so rude at one point he told me that I was parked on private property and needed to leave I had to advise him I was checking in and that I was sure the property belonged to the hotel. When he finally realised I was serious about checking in he then insisted I gave him my keys which I also advised I did not want vallate parking but he insisted on the keys. This whole incident ruined our last weekend in LA and really did have an affect on our stay as we now felt unwelcome and as if we were trespassers. I did not bring the car back to pick up the cases when we left instead took them up the road as this same man was doing your hotel his disservice . This man is an embarrassment to your otherwise fantastic hotel. It seems unless you are wearing designer clothes or look down my nose at people this hotel dose not want you to stay or at least that is the impression you get fom this man. im pretty sure my money is the same colour as everyone else's  .. would we stay here again I would love to!!!!! but I will never set foot inside your elitist hotel again,,1.0,4.0,,,3.0,,Sebastian K,Front Office Manager,2018-09-30,"keithx1,

We truly do apologize for your arrival experience. We have worked with Raffe in valet for over 4 years and have always had positive experiences reported by guests; however, it does look like he missed the mark on this interaction. We are looking into the incident with him and we will ensure that the hotel and all its representative are welcoming and open to all guests. Please let me know if there is anything we can do to turn your never again into a return stay.

I stay in hotels very regularly and also used to work in 5 star hotels so I am a discerning critic... and the staff here are second to none. Friendly, warm, funny, super attentive and thoughtful.

You're right near the famous Chinese theatre etc. 

My only complaint with the last stay there was that there was a movie premiere on one evening, and the hotel hosted a pretty loud party well after midnight - plus the streets were blocked off and it was hard to get back into the hotel.

We could feel the music in the room until nearly 2am and then had people running up and down the hallways screaming till 4am. For the price tag it just isn’t worth it, much nicer room and facilities at the bigger chains that charge the same price.

Naomie D,1,,2018-09-30,FAMILY,2018-08-31,5,Best guest treatment we’ve ever received!,"This is our second stay at the Hollywood Roosevelt. And we are just as thrilled with the kind warm excellent service we have received, as the first time we visited. 
When looking for a unique hotel experience for our teenaged daughters, we searched tons of properties and decided on the Roosevelt because it’s just the most beautiful charming historical property around. Once you come to the Roosevelt, you won’t ever stay anywhere else when visiting LA. You can walk to concerts at the Hollywood bowl, or go to dodgers stadium and all the other fun things in the area are all near by because of the central location. BUT, the biggest reason we will continue to stay here is the absolute kindness and gracious service this entire staff embodies. The valet is always helpful fast and not at all pretentious. Same with the bellhop, and our bellhop Graham, on this stay was extra amazing and helped us with all the “mom bags” (bags of treats and essentials we got at target on the way in, that always embarrass my kids)
And then he sent up cookies! Such a treat. Nicole at the front desk was SO gracious and offered to upgrade our room since we were staying 3 nights. And our daughters were just so so thrilled with the extra space and swanky room. It’s such small gestures that make ALL the difference in a vacation and the Roosevelt staff are remarkably exceptional and making you feel welcomed and pampered!!! I truly wish they could share tips and train other hotels,
so we could have the same wonderful experiences, we have here. Thank you Graham, Nicole, and Alex for your wonderful kindness and service:)

tristyn2017,5,"West Hollywood, California",2018-07-31,COUPLES,2018-08-31,5,Our Home away from Home,"This review has been a long time coming. After all, My boyfriend and I stay here a couple weeks a month. He travels for work and we love to call the Hollywood Roosevelt home while away. You can read about the general details that make this Classic Hollywood Hotel so amazing in every other review, so I'll try to get down to the details of what makes this place so special. 

Arriving: 
Enter off on Orange and Hollywood or Hawthorn to reach the Valet. You will promptly be welcomed by a team of friendly faces to assist with your luggage etc. If you have an electric vehicle and wish to be charged overnight, they are usually able to accommodate as long as there are chargers available at the time of arrival. 

When you enter, make a slight left, to meet Sebastian (the front office manager) and his front desk team. Immediately, you are offered a bottle of Evian while the team checks you in. If you are fortunate enough to frequent the hotel enough the staff will likely remember your preferences and apply them to the current reservation. 

The Rooms: 
1. Studio King 
2. Poolside Cabana King 
3. The Gable & Lombard Penthouse Suite and Rooftop.

1. If you are planning on staying more than a few days I highly recommend making the upgrade to a Studio King room in the main Tower. We especially prefer this room because there are two separate closet spaces. The bathroom is very roomy with lots of counter space. But the real wow factor is the beehive tiled spacious shower, 2 people can comfortably rinse off without even bumping into each other. on the other hand, there is also lots of room in case you wanted to bump into each other (*wink *wink). There is a magnified mirror for your makeup convenience ladies.. or gents. This is typical of Hotel hair dryers, so I won't count it against them, but I bring my own. I am a fan of the body wash scent. The Shampoo and conditioner are good enough if you forgot yours. Alternatively, Marshall's and CVS are right across the street, so you can pick up your favorites. The main living area is comfortable. They have a well stocked mini bar, but it'll cost ya! It is possible to request an extra mini fridge be brought up to your room for around $30. I would love to know every brand which makes up the glorious King size bed. The Mattress, pillows, and sheets are AMAZING. I don't sleep this well in my own bed, it's just so cozy!  

2. If you are staying for a weekend, I recommend one of the Poolside Cabanas. I personally prefer staying on the lower level because the patio connects to the main pool area for easy access, but still offers you privacy tucked behind the bamboo and kumquat trees (which are super delicious by the way). The cabanas lend to a more mid-century modern feel while the tower offers more of an art deco ambiance. I really love staying by the pool. The only reason I do not recommend the cabanas for a long stay is that it tends to get loud in the evenings for events that take place on the weeknights. 

3. If you really want to experience The Glamour of the Hollywood Roosevelt stay in the creme de la creme, the ultimate, the luxurious, The Gable & Lombard Penthouse Hotel Suite.

Above all the customer service is unmatched. Special thanks to Eric Willhite ""Director of Outlets"" who created the most magical private dinner birthday celebration on the Roof Top. There are so many individuals that deserve special recognition I will have to make a separate review just for them.",,5.0,5.0,,,,5.0,,,,,0

However, even if you are a paying guest (this is not a cheap hotel) they are more than happy to deny your access to facilities like the pool and bar if they get a better offer of a film premiere. We booked three nights at this hotel months ago as a treat at the end of completing Route 66 from Chicago to Santa Monica. We planned to spend a few days relaxing by the pool. We arrived on Sunday to find a loud and drunken pool party taking place at which we felt intimidated and the pool closed at 7pm. Today we went out for a few hours sightseeing and returned to find a note saying that the pool and bar were closed to residents until after 1pm on Wednesday. We leave on Wednesday morning. We went and made use of the pool until 6.30pm and expressed our disappointment to the reception desk. We were offered the use of a pool at another hotel - not sure who fancies walking up Hollywood boulevard in their swimming costume, or $100 worth of food/drinks (not $100 off our bill). Oh and at the last minute they told us they had extended the opening hours of the pool until midnight although how the guests were meant to know this I'll never know. Imagine our surprise when we returned from an evening meal at 10.45pm tonight and went to take advantage of our $100 to be told the bar was closed. The barman said the hotel were not prepared to pay his over time! All in all we feel very disappointed. We have had much better customer service at some of the cheaper hotels and motels during our trip across America. Not the best way to end our holiday.

The service and friendliness of staff is second to none. Juliana always checks that we are happy during our stay as she says the Roosevelt love returning visitors. 
As we were upgraded to a cabana room last year, we opted for one as our first choice this year. Had a pool balcony room and do we experienced the pool party from our balcony.

I felt compelled to write as this hotel is just superb. From the service on the front desk (Nicole who checked me in and helped throughout my stay was brilliant), to the service at the pool and every other staff touchpoint during the stay. I stay in a lot of hotels some of which are very modern, some of which try to create a history, some of which are places to relax and others places to party - the difference with the Roosevelt is it has or can do all of them. Now if they could just reduce the absurdly high car valet charge it would be absolutely perfect.",,,,,,,,Juliana P,Guest Relations Manager,2018-09-01,"prg00s,

gemma_kirkham,18,"Bedford, United Kingdom",2018-08-31,FAMILY,2018-08-25,5,What a hotel! What a room!,"We arrived on Thursday for a two night stay at the Roosevelt. We had read about it’s history and location but from the second we walked into reception we were blown away by the hotel, it’s staff and facilities.
At check in our room was ready and the guy was so friendly and helpful, he gave us a room on the 11th floor which I suspect was an upgrade from the room we had booked. When we got in the room we all screamed! We had a perfect view of the Hollywood sign and the boulevard below. The room surpassed all expectations! It was big enough for all of us, modern and clean!
We took a trip to the pool one day and even though our loud, splashing children didn’t quite go with the party and cool people that were there we had a great time! Pool service was great and the setting was beautiful. 
We had dinner in 25degrees and it was probably the best burger I have ever eaten! A must if you stay here!

The location was perfect for sightseeing, on Hollywood Boulevard and near all the attractions. 

One of the best hotels I have ever stayed in, I couldn’t find a single fault with it!",,,,,,,,Juliana P,Guest Relations Manager,2018-09-01,"gemma_kirkham,

Steven P,19,"Melbourne, Australia",2018-07-31,COUPLES,2018-08-24,1,The worst hotel ever,We stayed four nights at this hotel. When we got there I believed I was paying for the rooms but in actual fact they took the cost of the rooms for four nights out of my travel master card as a security deposit without telling me that this was the case. So when checking out I believed I had paid for the rooms but had to cough up $4000USD again for the actual payment of the rooms. The hotel released the original money they took but it took master card 30 days to put it back into my account. Totally incompetent and rude staff including the manager who I spoke to. As for the hotel itself we paid over $300US  a night for a room that was so small you could not even put the luggage anywhere. It sat on the floor for four nights and we had to keep stepping over it. The hotel was supposed to have undertaken some sort of renovation well they forgot to do the room we stayed in cause it was old and dark and gloomy. This hotel lives on it's reputation of being close to Hollywood Blvd But as for anything else it's not close. Overall a horrible stay and we will never stay there again.,Don&#39;t stay here if you want quiet there is a nightclub attached to this hotel,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,,Sebastian K,Front Office Manager,2018-09-07,"Steve P,

Charlotte L,44,"Milton Keynes, United Kingdom",2018-08-31,COUPLES,2018-08-23,3,Not worth the upgrade,"Checking in was easy and was offered help with our luggage. 
We had upgraded our room to a Cabana garden room when we booked our trip. At check in we was asked if we wanted to be closer to the pool...... but was advised that on Wednesdays they have pool party’s and can get noisy.... we said we didn’t mind and wanted to be nearer the pool. The check in lady then said it would be $75 extra per night. Firstly we never said we wanted to upgrade from the room we had already booked and secondly I think it’s quite rude. 
When we got to our Cabana garden room we were very disappointed, no garden view.... we were facing the street and being on the second level we looked out of the window and down to the room below patio area..... not very private. 
I called down to reception to ask if they had given us the correct room and she advised that was a cabana garden view! I mentioned that the rooms showed on there website show a patio area..... she said they only have 5 of these rooms. Very misleading. 
She offered us another room of the same standard which we did look at but it was exactly the same so we decided to stay with the room we were given. 
I just wanna add that the reason we upgraded our room when booking our trip is because this is our honeymoon so wanted a bit of luxury. 
Our room was opposite the cleaners cupboard, crashing and banging is heard a fair bit. Room 219 
We tried the burger restaurant 25 Degrees...... really good! Fries portion in massive and the beer burger is excellent.
Pool area lovely..... really expensive for drinks but then this is part of the hotel..... $25 for two beers 
Pool party night...... extremely nosy.... and our room isn’t near the pool but we couldn’t hear it well. Goes on till 2am so be warned. 
We had a question about the super shuttle which we asked at reception. The receptionist was really helpful and phoned through for us,Which was a great help. 
Though I was getting a bit annoyed that everyone who was checking in seemed to be getting a free upgrade to junior suite rooms and free WIFI 
WIFI is $15 per night.......I’ve never been to a hotel that doesn’t provide WiFi to its guest! 
The hotel location is excellent right across from the Chinese theatre. 
I wouldn’t stay here again I think the rooms are misleading I wish we had just paid for a tower room.
We have been travelling across USA and this was the smallest room we’ve had on our whole trip.",,,,,,,,,,,,16

The hotel is in a perfect location for Hollywood but is very much a party/drinking hotel. The rooms are beautiful and a great size but everything costs extra - the Wi-fi, parking, etc.

tamjan,3199,"Port Elizabeth, South Africa",2018-08-31,NONE,2018-08-19,3,Iconic only thanks to Marilyn,"Came here to stay in Marilyn Monroe’s suite. It was good , but surprisingly not what I thought. Odd photos / portraits on the wall. Found used condoms in my trash can as I checked in. Fridge was smelly. The decor and photos were Not necessarily her era. I think there’s one pic of her in the space. The hotel is nice but in need of attention to quite a few places (chipped paint and old amenities etc) . I saw many people by the pool. The outside Tropicana bar is great. WiFi, valet service, restaurant and a bar inside. Also an indoor cinema - nice surprise. Lights at night are pretty. Was a bit peeved off at a member of staff who laughed in my face after I wondered accidentally into some kind of “library” bar / private event space. I didn’t know I was in a private event - I thought it was open to everyone, until the bartender pretentiously told me to back off, basically. Staff do need need training. Don’t judge on looks alone whether or not someone has money - I guarantee you will fall short! Money doesn’t look like what you think it might look like! I put it down to immaturity of young staff. Management, word of caution, make sure you train your staff to treat all patrons with respect because you never know who you are talking to....no matter what bag they have in their hand.

The hotel was perfect for what we needed and had more local atmosphere than we expected.

Rooms were small but modern, clean and good amenities. Beds comfortable. The view from our room was so nice, looked straight out to the strip, lots of people watching. The other rooms with pool view would have been great too.

The pool was lovely, although as a hotel guest it seemed difficult to get a seat and only let down was the poolside service, slow & not friendly. The pool parties though made for great atmosphere, good music and some very interesting people watching. Definitely got an LA locals feel mixed in. 

Food was good although we didn’t eat in much as so many options nearby. Highly recommend this properly for a true tourist experience in a nice, safe environment. ",,,,,,,,Juliana P,Guest Relations Manager,2018-09-05,"TravelBug_83Sydney,

The clock radio's in the rooms now have a Bluetooth connection which is great, they work with any phone. The beds are immensely comfortable and the blackout curtains certainly do a great job of locking out sunlight from the room in the morning. The showers are lovely, and the towels as well, almost spa-like. Will I stay there again? Most definitely and soon at that!

Sarah H,107,,2018-07-31,FAMILY,2018-08-04,4,Love this hotel,"This was my third stay at The Roosevelt and this time I bought my husband & 12 year old son from Australia to experience it.

We were disappointed with the room. It was terribly small and inadequate for three people with 8 pieces of luggage and had a very uninteresting view of rooftops. However, it was probably my fault for booking the wrong room by mistake and also booking through my husbands Qantas airmiles and not advising the hotel that we were returning guests. When I stayed 2 years ago with a girlfriend, I thought we had a standard double room which had two beds and a lounge area. This must have been an upgraded room as I thought that was what we were booking this time.

We could have asked to change rooms I suppose, however, we decided as we were out at the theme parks and not spending much time in the hotel to put up with it.

The rest of the hotel is awesome. Love the history and vibe in hotel. We ate at both restaurants and food is great. We had a drink in the library bar which was nice and cosy. 

We enjoyed an afternoon at the pool. It is very crowded and difficult to get a pool lounger, however, we were eventually offered one.

Service in restaurants, lobby and bell service is excellent.

Would we return, most definitely. However, would ensure we book the right room.",,,,,,,,Juliana P,Guest Relations Manager,2018-09-05,"Sarah H,

Varun Maskara,133,"Gorakhpur, India",2018-07-31,COUPLES,2018-08-04,1,Lost Merchandise Case,"I had stayed between 30th June and 2nd Aug'18. I had enjoyed my stay and it is a classic hotel. Location is perfect. But, here items go missing...and I am sure it is not the ghosts...

When I checked out, I asked them about my bill and cleared everything that was due with Cash. They did not give me a receipt and said would mail me. I was like OK, now when I got the receipt, I was charged 

extra for some lost merchandise on my credit card. 

I usually do not check the receipt as it was not a business visit, but I was shocked by the extra charge. I called the Hotel and they asked my if I took a pair of slippers they had in room. I did not even touch it. Who would to pay 21 dollars for a pair of stupid rubber slippers?

They were not at all surprised and said would reverse the charge. It was like this is a normal occurrence and keeps happening. I was apalled how can such a serious matter be taken so easy. Is it normal for things to go missing? Or is it that they know how things go missing and do nothing about it?

Now that this happened, everything comes back to me. I was given a 6th Floor room and safe was not working. I asked them to repair it, they did not for 2 hours. When I made a little complaint, they transferred me to 8th floor better room. 

My Mont Blanc Pen got missing from room, I called them after check out to see if they found it, and they said they did not find it. I mean I was sure I must have dropped it somewhere, I could never imagine it to go missing from my room. But now after this lost slipper incidence, I am not too sure I dropped it and am more certain the pen got missing from the room. If slippers can go missing, why can’t my pen?

I would never recommend this hotel to anyone. What a disgrace after having served such high profile guests since the beginning of Hollywood.

An advise to the Management - PLEASE DO NOT KEEP CHARGEABLE ITEMS IN ROOM IF YOU CANNOT STOP THEM TO GO MISSING...

Also, when the safe malfunctioned, the guy who came in had a simple electronic tool to open it. Now I suggest you should change the system and have a safe that is more difficult to open by 
a third person...",,,,,,,,Sebastian K,Front Office Manager,2018-09-06,"Sahjanwa_VM,

Thank you for sharing your experience with us, we do wish it was a more positive experience from start to finish. First I do apologize for the errant charge on the slippers from the honor bar, while it is not a normal occurrence there are times that items can be mis-charged for various reasons - but we are always glad to honor the guests word when these issues do arise.

As for the safe, we apologize it was not working in your original room - but can assure you the electronic tool is controlled exclusively by our security (using a 6 digit PIN, as well as controlled access to the device itself) and keeps a log of anytime a safe has been accessed so that we have full tracking/information on the safe. We do apologize for the missing pen and I am glad to look further into this matter if you wish to share your stay information with me directly (sknight@journalhotels.com).

We do hope that these experiences haven't completely tarnished your opinion of the hotel and that there is an opportunity to turn you back into a loyal Roosevelt guest. Should you wish to try us again I would be glad to be your point person for any future stays.

Kind Regards,
Sebastian Knight

There are absolutely no Hollywood airs at the HR- even around the legendary swimming pool! We decided to upgrade to a suite, which overall we enjoyed and felt it was well worth it. The room, on the 12th floor, was large with a bath and a half (unexpected and quite convenient!), had barn doors at the bedroom for morning quiet and comfort, and was spacious. A couple of minor head-scratchers: There was a hole in the carpet, which seemed out of place, considering the ""suite"" feeling with the rest of the room; and, there were edgy art pieces hanging in the living room, which we enjoyed, except for someone (not us!) decided it was a good idea to puncture one of the pieces.

alexb123473,5,"New York City, New York",2018-07-31,FRIENDS,2018-07-29,3,Good hotel but...,"This hotel is beautiful with amazing history. It’s well designed and the staff are lovely for the most part. The area is a bit like Times Square in NYC around it and can feel a bit dodgy but that’s easily avoidable by taking an Uber from the valet parking area. Expect a mix of families as well as some crazies dressed up. 
This is my second stay here and there are a few issues I have found both times, but more so in this stay. 
Of course it’s LA and the crowd at this hotel is pretty mixed. The pool area ALWAYS smells potently of marijuana, also if you are staying by the pool in the cabanas you are in for many sleepless nights as they have events by the pool throughout the week. 
Also just because the hotel states the amenities of the pool that can quickly change if they have an event there and what was a chilled out, easily accessible area becomes party central. 
As the pool is open to anyone in the public the staff by the pool can be frustrating as the are always assuming you aren’t a guest so you constantly have to tell them you are staying there. The wait for a juice or cocktail ordered can also be up to 45 minutes as well. On the weekends the pool fills up quick so again.. Even if you are a guest that doesn’t mean you have preference over a random person off friends the street for a chair. 
Also be warned they will say the pool is only for hotel guests on the weeked yet if a random person of the street pays to reserve a bed by the pool you will be shafted as a paying hotel guest for that person. Disappointing. 
If you are in the tower (I recommend for the less ‘partying’ guests) the rooms are still not sound proof so there are some nights when you will still clearly here the pool area and the parties going on. 
Again, it’s a beautiful hotel and has a lot of amenities but I just wish they gave preference to guests than just anyone wanting to post Instagram pictures by the pool...",,,,,,,,,,,,13

It is an enormously impressive building dominating Hollywood Boulevard with the iconic giant sign on the roof.  I’ve wanted to stay here for a long time so perhaps I’d set my expectations too high. Room was comfortable and well equipped - though mirrors were in short supply. Like all luxury hotels there is a premium for some of the things you just take for granted. valet parking was about $45 per day and Internet was $15 a day - feel that’s rather cheeky. Another thing which irked me was access to the pool. On the Saturday afternoon we thought we’d head to the pool - surely a bonus for staying in a fancy hotel. That was a big mistake - the hotel allows external visitors to party at the pool - that’s fine but when there’s no room for residents you feel a bit cheated. There was a problem with the lock on the door to our room and this is when the hotel staff impressed. They really  stepped up and sorted it.  So particular thanks to Izzy and Alex on the front desk.

Tony H,17,"Kingswood, United Kingdom",2018-07-31,FAMILY,2018-07-26,1,Youth hostel at best,"Stayed here the last 2 nights. This was the 3rd hotel we stayed in during our time in LA. In short, if you are between the ages of 21 and 30, and pretty wealthy, then this is probably a good hotel for you. For everyone else, avoid it like the plague!
This hotel is very convenient for the Hollywood strip(walk of fame). It comes across as quite cool/chic however there were too many faults for me at $350 per night. 
I was here with my 2 teenage kids for 2 nights. We stayed in a Cabana room. In fairness to the guy at check-In he told me that wednesday nights were pool party nights and the music goes on until 2am. I was fine with that. However what I didn’t anticipate is that the walls and doors are paper thin and provide zero sound proofing (and I mean zero). After 2am when the music finally stopped a procession of guests would walk down the corridor continuing their poolside conversations at full volume. This finally finished at 5am. Around 6am I heard construction work somewhere. Throughout the night you also hear every toilet flush and shower. Now on top of this:-
A) the drinks were more expensive than anywhere on Earth (I travel globally and spend around 70 nights per year in very good hotels). $20 for a basic g&t and $12 for a half-size can of beer from the mini bar is taking the pi$$
B) not even a free bottle of water in the room
C) we were served a flat coke at the poolside and a beer from a can that was 3 months past it’s sell-by date
D) the barman tried to short-change me by $10 at the poolside (you know when they know that they are trying it on)
E) the food order was very late and despite a 5 minute conversation about the difference between “chips”and “fries” was wrong
F) the lights in our bedroom turned themselves on at 6am
G) the smell of marijuana around the pool is very very strong 
H) $45 per day for valet parking

On the plus side, the pool area was nice and the pool was warm. But that’s the only plus. 
Bearing in mind the 2 days prior I was at the intercontinental Beverly Hills for only $10 per day more, on that basis this hotel should have been around $120 per day.
So in summary, if you are between 21 and 30 and are either a couple or a group, no kids, no wives, if you plan on partying till 2/3/4 am and going to bed either paraletically drunk or completely stoned, and you’re happy to pay over the top for regular drinks, then you’ll get on fine here. Otherwise, avoid it like the plague !! Go stay at the intercontinental Beverley hills instead. I’d have stayed there for the extra 2 days if they had availability ",,,,,,,,,,,,10

pinedalk,4,"Pacifica, California",2018-07-31,FAMILY,2018-07-24,3,Nice but overpriced ,"Arrived to hotel, valet on point then just good from there. Movie premier blocked pool for first day but manager upgraded us the second day to a poolside suite which I thought was awesome but was soon to find out the joke was on me. Moved to the suite and all was good until pool party started and speakers were right outside our patio door and the party went till 2am. For most people, that would not be acceptable but we are old Burning Man peeps so really wasn’t an issue for us.  The only issue I had was our teens couldn’t go so we all stayed in the room or patio peaking at the party like “Peeping my Toms” Lol.  One true bummer, they allowed people to smoke at the pool, cigars included. Not so California for this SF girl. The most unfortunate issue with this hotel is it’s location. It’s smack in the middle of Hollywood Blvd’s undesirables laying on the streets amongst the walk of fame where all the stars lining the streets are so dirty you really don’t want to walk outside at all. You’ll just stay in the hotel which is not horrible it’s just not worth the price. ",,,,,,,,,,,,1

nikki,5,,2018-07-31,FRIENDS,2018-07-23,3,Like a skeleton - all the bones but not the flesh ,"Service and staff friendliness is in dire need of an overhaul. Service is inconsistent; at the pool cafe, drinks are repeatedly forgotten, water occasionally offered, and meals brought without cutlery or even the basics such as salt/pepper. The pool attendants are hard to find; the umbrellas are heavy and hard to move and I had to move them many times by myself as my requests for help were answered by “the pool attendant will he here in an hour” or “the pool attendant is on a break” etc”. On the weekends, the pool turns into a “club” complete with velvet rope, so even if you are a hotel guest unless you get a pool lounge by 10am you have to be on a waiting list for the pool/lounges.  We were treated to “club goers” playing their own boomboxes super loud right next to us, pouring shots of tequila from their handbags, lots of pot smokers, and even a couple of obvious meth users who we overheard saying “ we live up the street and just crash the pool”. Pretty classy Roosevelt, pretty classy! 
The coffeemaker in room was broken, request for flat pillow was ignored, daily room cleaning was variable; the bed made and bathroom cleaned daily but amenities were not refreshed nor were dirty coffee cups washed or replaced with clean, coffee pods for coffee maker were never replenished, and when I requested morning newspaper delivery to my room I was told “yes we can arrange that” but this must have been forgotten. 
Waited forever to order at evening bar when there was only 4 people present. Another guest commented that it was like “pulling teeth to get service”. Asked for a specific “wine by the glass that my friend had had the previous night”and the bartender thrust the wine menu in front of me stating “we don’t have that” and “these are the wines we have by the glass” I pointed to the one I had asked for which WAS on the list and the bartender never verbally responded, just turned his back and got the wine. Valet/doormen (?) don’t open the front doors for you just stand by and watch you do it by yourself. 
I stayed over a week and the only thing that was consistent was the service; consistently poor. 
The decor is nice especially the pool area, however it’s all a bit dark. The rooms feel boxy. Disappointed to find out that some rooms have a view of the Hollywood sign but was not offered it even after I paid for an upgraded room. I stayed in 2 different rooms and the beds were vastly different; one was amazing and firm, the other soft as a sponge. Both times I mentioned my discomfort with the spongy bed I was told they “would make a note of it”. 
It’s all a bit odd. Maybe it’s the ghosts... The staff vibe is odd; too cool for school, too cool to smile, too cool to serve you... Staff barely make eye contact let alone smile and say hello, you might get a greeting (if any) such as “what’s up?” ... no “hello” or “how are you?” and rarely any smiles... 
This hotel rates itself as 4 stars complete with 4 star pricing - not the best value or service for money. Management please note: a smile from your staff goes a long way to enhancing your guests experience. Maybe I would overlook the shortfall(s) if the staff were friendly.  After I spoke to Director of Operations, they offered me a complimentary breakfast on my last morning which was a nice gesture. ",,,,,,,,,,,,2

On the one hand the staff is first-class: at the door, behind the check-in desk, in the restaurant and the Cabana.  Also the food and wine list is top-notch.  The Cabana is a great place to relax and have a drink. Plus it oozes Hollywood history.  However, there are also downsides to staying here.  Number one is that Hollywood Blvd is totally out of control, it will wear you out.  Secondly, the rooms are small and dated (but this is to be expected for a hotel on the historic register).

This is an historic hotel right across from the Chinese Theatre and all of the action. It is a beautiful old hotel with check-in on the lower level and the main lobby on an upper level. The décor is historic and beautiful, but very dark. 
I had nothing but trouble with the check-in process. I upgraded my room and asked for an early check-in. When I arrived, I was informed that my room was not going to be available until after the check-in time of 3PM. So not only did I not get an early check-in, but they were not going to hit the advertised check-in time. My daughter and I had to change in the bathroom and go to the pool. We checked our luggage in with the Bellmen. It was much later than they originally said to get into our room. They refunded the money for the upgrade and gave me a free breakfast. They made an effort. Then I go back to get my luggage and the bellman cannot find it. He was calling around the hotel and I became quite stressed. The bellman let us in to the room and we found our luggage behind someone else's luggage. They gave me 2 free drinks for this trouble. OK.....the only reason I gave them a 4 is the effort they made to make-up for the issues.
The room was a king suite. Large, well furnished, corner room with a view of the Hollywood sign. Everything was impeccable in the room.
The pool area was nice. Very retro. Not as big as expected, but very nice. Get there early or you will not get a seat and will have to go on a ""wait list"" for chairs. They have a pool bar right off the pool and a DJ starts around 1PM most days. The pool seemed appropriate for my 12 year old and there were other younger kids there. 
The location is great. Right on Hollywood BLVD. in the center of the action. 

If you want to be in the center of the action in a Hollywood classic then this is your place. The check-in process and bellmen process was a fail, but they were very good about making amends.",,4.0,4.0,,,,5.0,,,,,129

The Hollywood Roosevelt did the trick. Easy to find and good location, we had a room at the end of a corridor. Id say the room was adequate for our needs, was nicely decorated but for a longer stay id opt for a larger room. As we were one night we did opt for a cheaper room so cant complain. We had valet parking which was good, they were very quick and efficient unlike some places where you have a wait.

Our original was too small for the price, but had a bigger bathroom. We only had one real complaint about the stay and one minimal one. Upon arriving, since it was going to be a long flight, I wanted to book an in-room or on the premises massage to take place the day we arrived. When I called to set one up two days prior I was directed to the masseur's line and left a detailed message and was never contected. I called about three separate occasions with no return calls, so I made off site arrangements (couples massage up sunset blvd was worth the $6 uber ride). The minor complaint was about having to call two days in a row to receive a glass from house keeping.

Our first day was full of sunshine in LA, but the Spanish Renaissance architecture inside the Roosevelt – the bar and the lobby, in particular – was more to my taste. I was inspired by the decadent colour palette and velvet couches in the bar. In the night, we later discovered yet another bar which had a double lane bowling alley; certainly a bit of fun.

Tip: book in advance for the bowling alley if you’re that way inclined to attempt a strike or two.

Outside in the sun, guests relaxed by the pool. Brunch was a treat washed down by a refreshing Bloody Mary, dare I say it? Before noon.

As we were soon to discover, old-Hollywood had a strange air to it. Like someone lurking in the shadows everywhere we went. Inside the Roosevelt Hotel was full of people with beautiful outfits and smiling faces, but underneath it all, something unseen bubbles just below the surface. 

The Hollywood Roosevelt is a time capsule for ghosts of stars past- several of them are claimed to be roaming the hallways of the Roosevelt, including Marilyn Monroe, who was in residence for two years. 

One step outside the hotel and we found ourselves in the heart of Hollywood, on the Walk of Fame, and all of the clichés were out to welcome us. The snake charmer, Marilyn Monroe, Batman and Robin, as well as just about every other comic strip character you’ve ever seen.

All in all, great drinks, great service and steeped in Hollywood History; a pleasant stay if you want to experience first-hand the real meaning of Tinsel Town right on your doorstep.","Room 213, is reported to be the most haunted room in the entire hotel.",,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,,,,,0

They had a pool party every day and opened it up to non guests so it was packed. It's a 2 hour wait just for a chair/bed. It was very disappointing. Our kids didn't get to swim once.

We chose it because we wanted a nice pool to relax at while being able to go out in LA at night. We were so disappointed to find out that this pool is not exclusive to hotel guests. Instead, anyone willing to spend money on day beds and/or bottle service can come in and take over. We had to get to the pool early in order to get chairs. The pool was so crowded last Saturday and Sunday -it was ridiculous. There were so many people that it was hard to get in and get out of the pool. There were plenty of trashy 20 somethings yelling and carrying on, spraying champagne, and smoking weed. Music blasted all day on the weekends and each time we got up to go to the room, we were asked by security if we were leaving. They also questioned us each time we entered the pool. They said they would hold our chairs for 20 minutes, but after we were gone for 10 minutes, someone had taken our shade. One morning we brought in açaí bowls to eat quickly because we didn’t want the same old junk food. A server descended upon us immediately and told us that outside food is not allowed. I can understand a policy, but I don’t see how that is more of a problem than letting people smoking pot everywhere, get very drunk, and even have a girl exclaim loudly that she was high on shrooms while in the pool. This hotel needs to decide if it wants to be a club instead. If so, they need to make their patrons aware so that they make the right choice for their stay.

The only exit on the bottom was an emergency exit, which we decided to use and the alarm DID NOT sound. We missed our Uber who drove away. When we returned that evening I took the kids to the pool to only find drunk, unruly adults who were not hotel guests and are apparently allowed to use the pool if their bar tab is large enough.

Being it was our first time in LA, we wanted to be truly immersed.  This is a hotel that has been restored to its former glory.  We had selected a cabana room and were upgraded to a nice room with a balcony overlooking the pool area.  The front desk staff warned us about the noise around the pool and we had read reviews, but think the cool weather might have been the reason that it didn’t seem so loud.  Clearly, weekends were more noisy than week days, but nothing outrageous and honestly we had fun watching the antics of some of the day guests.  Our room had everything we needed, but I should mention that the bed is low, mattress on platform, but very comfortable in our opinion.   We ate breakfast at 25 degrees in the morning (attached to hotel) which was a convenient reasonable option.  A drink by the pool will set you back but its comparable with other  hip pool or roof top venues.
We found it particularly interesting that we were inside an oasis when in the courtyard and yet, outside the front door, there is the craziness of Hollywood with many people in costumes (Hulk. Superman, ...) and everything else associated with Hollywood.

EDPJAP,20,"East Peoria, Illinois",2018-06-30,BUSINESS,2018-06-24,4,Very nice and great staff,"The Roosevelt is one of Hollywood’s original hotels and it is very nice! Our room wasn’t huge, but size-wise was what we expected for a historic hotel and perfect for us. The room has all the modern items one would expect including a very large flat screen TV. 

However, there is no coffee pot in the room. This is the first hotel we have stayed in since Las Vegas in 2005 that didn’t have a coffee pot in the room. The hotel website said there is complimentary coffee and tea in the lobby, which sounded so inviting after having been up since 4 a.m. to get our flight from the Midwest to L.A. But upon checking at 1 p.m., we were told the complimentary coffee is only from 7-10 a.m. The hotel management should really consider having coffee pots in the room.

The wi-if is not free, but upon questioning that on checking in, the very friendly front desk clerk offered to give us the code which was very nice of her. (And I am using it now to post this review!)

The bed is phenomenal! It is very comfortable! The hotel is also quiet, and the temperature control excellent, never too cold or too warm.

The staff is great and so nice!! Fabulous staff!!!!",,,,,,,,Sebastian K,Front Office Manager,2018-09-01,"K6628RBericp,

So when I planned a trip to LA to see an old friend of mine, I decided to book 2 nights at this hotel. I booked the private cabana room which was great as it gave me easy access to the pool area. There was movie night on Tuesday and I was able to watch the big screen from my room which was nice. I loved the Hollywood Roosevelt. It’s a beautiful hotel and you really feel like you are in Hollywood. The room is great and spacious with a comfy bed. There are over 3 different restaurants. The menus great with a wide selection. Room service was particularly good. It usually is a disappointment at all hotels I have stayed at, but not the Hollywood Roosevelt. It’s also 24 hour room service.

We wanted to visit Universal Studios and explore Hollywood itself so the Roosevelt was the perfect choice and it proved to be the right one.
Great location, in fact, you just can't beat it, right on the strip with the Hollywood walk of fame right outside the from doors.
Our room was great,spacious and comfortable with an enormous bathroom. We looked right onto Hollywood Boulevard and could see the famous Hollywood sigh as well. As far as rooms go, this one ticked all of the boxes.
I love the history of Hollywood and the hotel itself is full of it. Also being into the paranormal, the Roosevelt also has it's fair share of ghostly guests which I found a real treat.
The 24 hour diner/coffer shop 25 Degrees was wonderful, eating breakfast there each morning. We also dropped in for a late night meal and had the best burger & shake we've ever eaten!

JFHcambridge,64,"Cambridge, Massachusetts",2018-06-30,SOLO,2018-06-18,4,A much better stay than last time...with caveats,"I stayed in the main (read: original) hotel this time and liked it so much better than the cabana room they put me in last time. The room was not large, but just fine for a single traveler. Odd thing...there was one mirror in the whole room and that was the bathroom sink mirror. This was the first time a long while where I did not have a full-length mirror in my room!

The staff are great, the food is very good, the pool is wonderful (I only used it in the early part of the day before the sun took over)...and the location is perfect if you want to do things in Hollywood or neighboring areas.

But once or twice or three times a week they have outdoor pool parties, complete with LOUD DJ, that run until 2 am and there is no way to escape the noise if your room faces the rear of the hotel. I understand the service they provide to the local party crowd, and some guests I suppose, but boy it can delay a person's sleep, big-time!",,,5.0,4.0,,4.0,,Sebastian K,Front Office Manager,2018-09-01,"JFHcambridge,

AdventureSnails,2,"Portland, Oregon",2018-05-31,FAMILY,2018-06-18,5,A Comfortable Escape in a Hectic Town,"During a weekend trip to Hollywood to see some touristy sights and visit Universal Studios, we had the pleasure of staying at the Hollywood Roosevelt hotel. When you walk in, the ambience is immediately welcoming - dimmer lighting, water features, beautiful tiling, and the touch of coolness that only 1920's Hollywood has going for it. 

Because we were traveling with family, the receptionist made sure we stayed on the same floor - which meant giving us an upgrade for free! 

The rooms are clean and comfy, and it's *right* on Hollywood Blvd. This means that you can walk to any tourist trap you want in about 5-8 minutes, and you're also only one subway stop from Universal Studios. Take the free tram once you exit the subway and cross the sky bridge and you're there in minutes. 

This is a great hotel. The staff is friendly, it's centrally located, and just has that straight up co factor. Their restaurant 25 Degrees also serves great burgers... as well as alcoholic milkshakes. And they're open 24 hours. I'll let you do the math on that one.

Michael B,31,"Baltimore, Maryland",2018-06-30,BUSINESS,2018-06-15,5,"Brilliant, historically hip","When I visit Los Angeles, I tend to stay either in booming downtown or in posh Century City.  But, a conference brought me to Hollywood this time.  The conference hotel was sold out so I had to choose between the W Hollywood and the Hollywood Roosevelt.  Although I am a devoted Starwood member, I went with the Roosevelt and it was such a great call.  Located right near the intersection of Hollywood and Highland, the Roosevelt is perfectly located in the middle of the Walk of Fame and adjacent to a Metro Red line station.  

The Roosevelt is a brilliant example of a historic hotel (1920s) that has been thoughtfully renovated and updated so that you can enjoy the charm of a period building without missing any of the convenience and amenities of a new property.  The service and staff were fantastic.  Everyone from the front desk to housekeeping to the concierge to room service was friendly and helpful without exception.

I requested and got a high floor room in the tower portion of the hotel, which offered peace and quiet along with great views looking south toward downtown.  The room itself was incredibly comfortable and stylishly designed with a great four poster bed, hardwood floors and a huge bathroom.  There was a very comfortable wingback chair plus a huge desk for working.  The mini-bar is not your average mini-bar; more like mini-bar for rock stars.  Adjacent to the tower are the hotel’s cabana rooms, which I hear are more for the party set.  But, even my pale, conference-nerd self was very comfortable hanging out one afternoon by the gorgeous pool.

Within walking distance of the Roosevelt are all of Hollywood’s attractions.  And, if you're trying to stave off the effects of L.A.'s obsession with burger joints, donut shops and hot dog stands, one particular asset of the Roosevelt is its location within 5 minutes of the Runyon Canyon hiking trails in the Hollywood Hills.  What a great way to start the day by hiking up through the hills and catching the sun rise over downtown Los Angeles.

From top to bottom and beginning to end, the Hollywood Roosevelt was a fantastic stay.  It is one to which I would definitely return when business or fun brings me back to Los Angeles.","For peace and quiet, I would request a high floor room in the tower.",,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,Juliana P,Guest Relations Manager,2018-07-04,"Michael B,

We booked the Roosevelt Suite for our family of 4 (we took the bed and the kids slept on a pull-out sofa bed). All in all we were very comfortable. 

The room was extremely spacious with 2 bathrooms, a dining area, large bedroom and spacious living area. We came in to find chocolates and a cool bottle of Evian and glasses awaiting us, along with a nice note to welcome us. The decor was amazing -- just beautiful. 

There really wasn't much to complain about. There was no hair dryer in the room. I suppose I could have called down to get one brought to me, but when your hair is already soaking wet, you don't really want to see anyone. I don't usually pack one because most hotels have this, but our room didn't. I also wish there were guest laundry facilities because we were on a road trip and had accumulated quite a bit of dirty laundry. They do offer to do your laundry for you, but it's very expensive (especially for four people) so we opted out of this.

Mitchell B,132,"Provincetown, Massachusetts",2018-05-31,COUPLES,2018-06-04,2,Nice to place to feel unvalued as a guest,"This hotel is among the most beautiful structures we have stayed in, however, so many small things added up to leaving a bit of a sour after-taste. We are two men, one 54 and the other 65, and we consider ourselves sophisticated, always sharply dressed and urbane. I would say, on average, for every staff member who gave us a warm and sincere smile, there were four who either simply would not look us in the eye, or engage with us beyond the lowest denominator of service. No banter, no interest in us once they had performed their service. This was most notable at the pool. During our lunch our initial waitress ""went on break"" with-out informing us, leaving me to search down another person to get us a second cocktail and perhaps clear our dirty plates for us. The short blond-haired waitress let us know in very certain terms we were not her people. Scowled at us and ignored my pleasantry when she brought our drinks, walks away to a younger-than-us foursome and boy, did she ever light right up for them!! Laughing, bantering, making them feel welcome, whilst continually passing our table without eye-contact. I had to chase someone down in order to pay. One guy I came to call ""fedora"" really really needs to work on his professional smile. It was so phony and quick-to-dissappear I almost felt like letting him know how fake his ""greeting"" was to me. Each time I entered the Pool bar, I was questioned as to whether I was a guest there; twice by the same young woman.  I noticed no other person under 40 who was asked that question. If any of those pool servers were asked to describe me after I left, I am 100% certain they could only describe me as ""old"", or ""grey-haired"".   So, that's the pool experience (it stank). Each night of our stay the lobby was over-taken by a private event (or three) and exclude hotel  guests are considered ""in the way"". In our room was a card extolling the experience of the Library Bar. We were barred from entering three nights in a row due to an event. We were treated like dirt by the unsmiling, unfriendly goons in black suits. They even refused me a quick look just to see the architecture of the room. Again: unsmiling, unhappy they had to speak with me, and dismissive.

To make matters worse, there was an event in the Penthouse each night. It seems they add an ""express"" feature for one of the two elevators to take event guests to the Penthouse. As we were nobodies to them, and there are only two elevators in the hotel, one night it took us 25 minutes waiting for a car to actually stop for us on the 9th floor. 25 MINUTES WAITING TO GET TO STREET LEVEL. How they can justify that situation is beyond me. So strange to be a full-price guest at a hotel, and have so many services and features rented out from beneath you. We always feel welcome were we travel because we are polite, enormous tippers (who once worked service ourselves) and we consider ourselves attractive and engaging, despite the crime of having reached middle-age. This is more an event venue than a hotel, and they are experts at polite avoidance of guests who do not fit their ""image"". What an insult! We are world travelers and have NEVER been made to feel so unimportant, and unwelcome anywhere else we have stayed. I love historic hotels and this building is stunning. Too bad it is among the worst run places I have ever had the misfortune to stay at. If you are over 25, do yourselves a favor and stay at any of the hundreds of other hotels in the area. A great place to feel inferior and unimportant.",Make sure you are no older than 33 years. They do not want you otherwise.,1.0,1.0,,,,5.0,,,,,108

The hotel is centrally located near many good restaurants, bars and attractions. I highly recommend the runyun canyon hike. Great veiws of Hollywood.

We stayed in a lovely room (complete with a four poster bed) with all the amenities you expect and more. As we were staying on one of the higher floors, noise was minimal despite being right on Hollywood Boulevard. 

The downsides...in this day and age, especially at the amount they charge per night, WiFi should be free. The WiFi is sitting there waiting to be used so why not give it to your guests? $15 a night = NO CHANCE!!! Also, we were looking to enjoy a cocktail in The Spare Room so we asked the concierge where it was. We went up there only to find out that it's closed on a Tuesday. You'd think employees of the hotel would know this and inform us instead of sending us up?

TIP : If you are looking for parking, avoid the extortionate $45 valet parking and park at the Hollywood & Highland across the street for $15. It's literally across the road.",,,3.0,,5.0,,5.0,Juliana P,Guest Relations Manager,2018-06-02,"TornxTissue,

lauraleehayes108,6,"Atlanta, Georgia",2018-05-31,FAMILY,2018-05-29,5,Amazing hotel with incredible history.,"This hotel was much nicer than we initally expected. We stayed in a king suite. It also had a king size pull out couch and two separate bedrooms with a dining area and large bathroom. Our room had an unobstructed view of the Hollywood sign and Hollywood Boulevard. AMAZING!
The hotel staff was also incredible. We never waited more than 5 minutes for our car from valet. Our daughter was intrigued by the history and a staff member gave us a tour and pointed out interesting places within the hotel and knew a lot about the history. Easy check in and out.
Extremely clean, room was stocked with amenities, luxury bedding, great beds. Security was at each door to the hotel. We slept with the windows open on a high floor and felt safe.
The hotel has been renovated to revive its original style. It feels like you've truly stepped back into 1930s Hollywood. 
The pool is beautiful and heated (and again, very clean). Ample chairs to relax and a nice bar. The pool wasn't very busy and was great for kids. 
There were numerous parties during our stay, but we were on a higher floor so the noise never bothered us. 
The food in each of the restaurants is delicious, so be sure to try each of them.
They did charge a $500 deposit for incidentals. The room was stocked with local beer, wine, liquor, soft drinks, and water. It was nice to have it available.
Stay here. You won't regret it. It's definitely worth the money for the experience.",,,,,,,,Juliana P,Guest Relations Manager,2018-06-02,"lauraleehayes108,

We had no issue of any poolside bar noise and actually were disappointed at how little atmosphere it actually had. The main issues for me were the little things like paying for a suite and having to pay 6 dollars for a bottle of water, not having coffee/ tea making facilities and having to pay $25 extra for a fold away bed for our son. I just felt that the whole experience was trying to get as much money from you as possible and the staff seemed to act the same.

KAByrnes,4,"Elmhurst, Illinois",2018-05-31,FAMILY,2018-05-25,5,"Well-run, clean, great location","One of our daughters lives a few blocks away from the hotel and that was the first motivation in booking here.  We are also moderately avid TCM fans (that is, we watch often but don't do other fan stuff--other than now having stayed at HR), so that connection was fun.

We had two studio king rooms on the 9th floor. They were east exposures so we had direct views down to the Boulevard, of the Chinese Theater, the Dolby, and all that.  The rooms were clean, showed virtually no wear and tear from their now 10+ year old renovation (as I understand it), and nicely outfitted with the usual bed, nightstands, and desk, but also a comfy side chair, ottoman, love seat, and coffee table.  The bathrooms are white and were very clean with no signs of discolored grout or that sort of thing.

This is not the Ritz Carton, Fairmont, or Waldorf, but more like a boutique hotel with its own style.

We valet-parked our vehicle and service to and from the car was A+, just what you'd expect from a great full-service hotel--opening and closing the car doors for the occupants, loading and unloading the trunk, and giving directions.  Nice.

There is no business center as business road warriors might be familiar with, but there are two monitors and keypads located at one end of the main desk, which guests may use; I printed our return boarding passes there.

The main floor lobby has a sort of Spanish-Moorish decor and has low lighting, presenting a certain charm.  There are two primary food venues: 25 Degrees along the Hollywood Blvd. elevation and the Public Kitchen and Bar along the Orange Avenue elevation.  We breakfasted several times at 25 Degrees, a sort of throwback spot with old mosaic tile floors, leather booths, and a counter.  It's open 24 hours with a full bar.  Service was very good as was the fare.  We all had dinner at the Public Kitchen on our last night there, and had a wonderful time.

Another reviewer said this was a well-oiled machine, and I agree if one takes that in a positive sense.  As noted above, in some ways it strikes me as a boutique hotel, though at 300 rooms it would be large for such a category.  To sum up: clean, great service, nicely appointed, good food, excellent location--and we look forward to staying again.",We stayed in the tower and it was quiet.

There’s tons to do around the hotel but honestly, we love to mostly hang out here at the hotel when we visit. We always stay in a poolside cabana room. It’s just perfect with a balcony overlooking the pool or a private patio. The hotel has a delicious burger place open 24 hours, nice restaurant for dinner or brunch & several bars. We love to hang out around the famous pool on the comfy loungers listening to music & sipping yummy drinks. We also love the Spare Room! Delicious cocktails & old fashioned vibe. I can’t say enough about the amazing staff. Everywhere from the valet to check in desk to the restaurants/bars. Everyone goes above & beyond expectations. We met Mark last time when we were checking out & he was kind enough to give us a little tour of the penthouse & roof top. It was an amazing way to end our trip & made us feel like we were getting a vip experience. Can’t wait to return in October for my Birthday! Thank you to everyone who has made our experience amazing there!!",,,,,,,,Sebastian K,Front Office Manager,2018-05-16,"Laura W,

Champagne, anyone? The darling driver (whose name escapes me) took us reluctantly back to the airport 5 days later. Reluctant on our part, not his. 
We absolutely did not want to leave the Hollywood Roosevelt! Who would??
When we check in - a speedy and considerate process - the adorable front desk man with the gracious smile (seriously, I am going to have to wear glasses to read name tags) found us the Roosevelt Suite and changed our trip from divine to delirious! 
The view! The amenities! The comfort! That bed - the minute my head touched the pillow sweet dreams of having my own star on Hollywood Blvd commenced. 
We have to give a special shout out to our night Room Service Guy. He has been there five years and every year he remembers us! But can I remember his name?? Our orders were always promptly delivered, properly serviced (a bucket of crushed ice!) not to mention delicious at any time of night. 
Kudos to 25 Degrees outside the lobby of the hotel for the best breakfast in town. Pretty spectacular since they also serve the best burgers in town as well.

The hotel staff really makes the place so inviting.  From the front desk  to the  restaurants to the general staff, service is top notch.  The physical plant itself is fine --- well  appointed and very clean.  I would have given 5 stars but for one glitch.  We were originally put into a room on  the 3rd floor --- with windows which are completely frosted over and do not open.  Quite claustrophobic.  Added to that was the distinct smell of cigarettes in the room.  I must say, though,  that the front desk handled our disappointment professionally and offered us a room change without hesitation.  Unfortunately the only room which was then available was half the size, which we took.  My recommendation (a constructive recommendation) would be to fully disclose that one cannot see through the windows on the third floor, and to charge less for those lesser rooms.",,,5.0,,5.0,,5.0,Sebastian K,Front Office Manager,2018-05-13,"scarknighttraveller,

Julie Christie, Clark Gable and Marilyn Monroe prints graced our floor. If Hollywood Boulevard is your destination this hotel is ideally situated. Bathrooms are functional but small.

My team and I along with my kids were there for the promotion of #infinitywar Hollywood Premiere Event on April 22. I called in advance to find out more about the accessible rooms available for the Hard of hearing and those with mobility issues. Spoke to Brian G. at the Front Desk and was very pleased with the accommodations that he upgraded us to based on my special needs and being a travel agent. We arrived around 11A just one (1) hour before expected. We walked around the property and were very pleased with the decor. It is very elegant old Hollywood with a masculine touch of dark leather, dim lighting, and wrought iron accents. They had our room available 15mins before scheduled. We did have a problem with the some of key cards we were given but that was corrected with an apology.We did notice that the registration desk did not have the adjusted counter for those confined to a wheelchair. The 1 Bedroom King Suite was 700sqft of luxury! The door to the bedroom is a sliding barn door that provides beauty and function to the room. Evian waters are offered at the bedside table and bar for purchase. The mini bar is well stalked with top-shelf liquor and many needed sundries if you forgot them. There were 2 closets (one is a walk-in) provided in the room. The bathroom was nice but small compared to what the room offered, still functional nonetheless. The TV greeting us by our name on the welcome page is a very nice touch. The bell staff and valet are well attentive. Mitchel was one of the bell staff that was very accommodating as he brought our luggage to our room and down to the luggage holding area as we were checking out. Since many after party events were located in the hotel, we were apprehensive that we would be dismissed, however, this was not the case. The Tropicana Bar and Pool is very classic Hollywood picturesque with tall palm trees and a well-heated Olympic size pool with daybeds encircling it, but still kid-friendly. I was pretty sad that there wasn't a jacuzzi available. The bar has a sizable area off to the side & away from the pool where you can sit and grab food with a group of friends. Bottle service is available. Unfortunately, the bar couldn't handle the number of orders it was given at the time we visited. Our wait was pretty long for drinks and appetizers, but my kids wanted to swim so my guest & I made due. The boutique touches around the hotel are what I love the most. They have an area filled with old classic books that I wanted to peruse but didn't have enough time explore. The lobby is a distance from the registration area and looks like an enclosed Spanish tiled courtyard. The carpeting on the room floors is soft & plush as you walk to your assigned room. Even the orchid flower arrangements are quite elegant and real. We inquired about late checkout and it made packing much easier as we were not rushed out of our room to pack after a late night. The alarm clock provided has much to be desired so if you like to play music or charge your phone, you would need to bring your mini-surge protector to charge your mobile devices.When we check out, the Front Desk took my feedback on the accommodations to get engineering to work on them immediately for the next guest. All in all, we were quite pleased by our overall conversations & experiences with other guests of the hotel! We definitely plan to return and try a cabana room.

maySunshineCoast,108,,2018-04-30,COUPLES,2018-04-23,4,Great older style hotel in the middle of all the action,"On arrival in the very early morning ... 6.00 am ! From Australia we were pleasantly surprised to be able to get into our room. The room was small but clean and the bed comfortable. The only thing I found annoying was that there was no kettle in the room, which was a problem for us as we like our cup of tea first thing. I know that there was free tea and coffee in the reception but having to get dressed and go and get a tea in a styrofoam cup was not appropriate.! The hotel is lovely in the 50's style and it was great to walk out the door and be on the walk of fame and across from the Chinese Theatre.
All the staff were very helpful and pleasant. On one of the nights we were there though at the main bar reception area we were unable to sit and have a drink as there was a private function on, only leaving a small area at the bar to sit.",,,,,,,,Sebastian K,Front Office Manager,2018-04-29,"maySunshineCoast,

The hotel is located perfectly in West Hollywood if you don't mind some large crowds around move premieres that take place on the main street out front.

angelopaleologos,1,"Boston, Massachusetts",2018-04-30,FAMILY,2018-04-15,5,The Best of Hollywood,"With lots of action and much to see, the Roosevelt is a hotspot in Hollywood. 

Starting with the arrival, getting to the hotel and checking in was very easy. We got to our rooms and were surprised with how satisfied we were. But, one of the two rooms that we had contained a very small bathroom. The hotel was quick to change our room the next day to have a bigger bathroom. 

Like previously mentioned, the employees at the hotel have been extremely welcoming and cooperative. They have kept my family and I updated on events both inside and outside of the hotel, while attending to our needs. Special thanks to overnight supervisor, Bill Paz, who has provided us with personal attention and unique experiences to make us feel like real Hollywood stars while staying at the hotel. 

As for the location, many would say that the Roosevelt isn't in the best area. But, when walking both during the day and at night, there were many people around and safety wasn't a huge concern

I know I previously mentioned events and how the hotel is a hotspot. We learned from employees that G-Eazy performed at the hotel the day before we arrived. We have also heard from others that the pool at the Roosevelt is an iconic place in Hollywood. A few days in, we met people from other parts of California who stopped by the pool for drinks. Very easy going and an overall fun vibe. 

I would recommend this hotel, especially for the 18+ clientele. Thats not to say that the Roosevelt and it's area isn't good for the younger teens. There's much to do and it's in the heart of the action, so you'll find something despite your age. The Hollywood Roosevelt is a great place to stay to experience Hollywood in the best way!",,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,,Sebastian K,Front Office Manager,2018-04-29,"angelopaleologos,

Mark H,8,"Friday Harbor, Washington",2018-04-30,FAMILY,2018-04-14,1,Very disappointed,"Staying at the Roosevelt was a dream for us. We drove 6 hours, looking forward to a drink and swim on our arrival.

We checked in at around 3pm, and the room wasn't what we ordered. We ordered a two room suit, but got two queen beds in the same room. Never mind, the pool awaits!

Having changed and found the pool, we're told it's closed for a ""private event"". We could walk a mile to a sister property (a mile up Hollywood Blvd  in swim gear!) and use their pool. Or do without. We weren't even allowed to look at and photograph the ""historical"" pool!

Turns out the ""private event"" was a rap concert that started at midnight. Dunno why they shut the pool at 3pm.

However, we do know now why they insisted on pre-charging our credit card.

Did I mention the concert started at midnight? Guess who didn't get much sleep.",,,,,,,,Sebastian K,Front Office Manager,2018-04-15,"Mark H,

Incredible location for experiencing the ambience of Hollywood Boulevard and walking to see the sights. Beautiful architectural details, tilework, ceilings, a must-see. We had a glimpse inside the ""Blossom Ballroom"" where the 1st Academy Award dinner was held. From there we hiked to Mama Shelter to visit the rooftop bar. After that we walked back, stopping at the Black Rabbit Rose and at the Musso & Frank Grill where we had reservations for dinner. A number of shops needed visiting along the way.

Hotel is lovely and clean and staff were always polite and helpful. Breakfast was part of the comp but they were expensive for what you got. The restaurant is open 24/7 they also do food to the room. Rooms were spacious and have tv mini bar ( avoid) not cheap at all. If you need drinks or a snack. There is a pharmacy across the road at half the price. A free safe is included in the room too. Rooms made up daily. 
The hotel has a gym and a pool. The pool is lovely with a bar at the side. Pool is not very child friendly without arm bands or rubber rings as it skopes to deep water quickly. There was a private party at the pool at 3pm one day so no guests were allowed to use. This was poor if you were a paying guest. 
The hotel has a wooden bowling alley but you have to be 21 as it has a bar which i think is stupid if your taking kids. The lobby is big and guests are entitled to free coffee and tea. 
I would stay again but would think about taking kids. ",,,,,,,,Sebastian K,Front Office Manager,2018-04-15,"Wheatman228,

sammysshaw,6,"Eugene, Oregon",2018-03-31,FRIENDS,2018-04-03,5,Best Hotel in L.A.,"Hands down the best service I have ever experienced—they seriously treat everyone like a celebrity. The room was beautiful and it was so convenient to have two bathrooms. My favorite part was the heated salt water pool, my best friend and I visited when L.A. was experiencing some rainy weather but the staff opened up the pool for us and had someone keep watch for lightning. The housekeepers were outstanding and impeccable, every evening we came home to a pristine room, they even laid out our clothes neatly on the bed and organized our toiletries in the shower. The actual hotel is gorgeous, it was so much fun having cocktails in the main lounge and admiring all the historic details like the palm wallpaper and plush pin cushion sofas. I love this hotel so much and can’t wait to be back.",,,,,,,,Sebastian K,Front Office Manager,2018-04-08,"sammysshaw,

Gerry175,60,,2018-03-31,COUPLES,2018-04-02,4,Right in the thick of it,"Hotel is situated right on Hollywood Boulevard. Historic hotel and we had a room overlooking the pool with a small balcony. The room was substantial and had everything that was required. We checked in at 9.00am and they had a room available which was a bonus as we had been on a long flight. The SPARE ROOM BAR is a highlight, that includes bowling alley (even though very expensive). All staff were friendly and helpful and bit of fun.

AdSmith28,33,"New York City, New York",2018-03-31,BUSINESS,2018-04-01,4,Classic Hollywood Hotel,"For the past 5 years, I've had business in Hollywood.  I usually stay at another hotel, but they were sold out and stayed at the Roosevelt for the first time. I was in a Standard King Room 1011, facing a side street off Hollywood Blvd. The rooms are nice, spacious (bathroom was a bit tight) but nicely decorated - modern contemporary. The bathroom counters are narrow - mine was wider, but most aren't spacious. Comfortable beds. Very clean. Room service was fast, food was good, not great. There's no coffee/tea machine in the room, so you have to bring it up or order in, although they have it complimentary in the lobby in the morning. GORGEOUS POOL and pool bar, casual restaurant. Decent Wifi. Great location and service is very good. Here's what I really disliked: The lobby is OLD and DARK, even at 1pm on the sunniest of days. It's not my decor (old, spanish tiles) and multi-level. I hated the lobby, but that's subjective and who cares - you're not really in there. It's not bad I suppose, just not my thing. The TV was super slow...took forever to check the TV Guide and select channels. The problem with this hotel is that it's VERY LOUD. It's a party hotel and if you're facing the pool, good luck. If you're facing Hollywood Blvd., it's still loud, but quieter. my room wasn't too loud (by the way, I live smack-dab in the center of Manhattan, so street noise is usually not an issue), but the people were. Overall, this is a NICE hotel, but definitely more of a hot-spot vs. family hotel, which is typically great with me, minus the noise. Also, Hollywood Blvd. is loud until about 1-2am with street performances, etc. but earplugs solved this without issue for me. Slow elevators, nice hallways. FYI!","If you want to party, face the pool. If you want it less loud, face a street.",,4.0,,5.0,5.0,,Sebastian K,Front Office Manager,2018-04-08,"Dear AdSmith28,

On those two points it was perfectly fine. The pool area is lovely if you can find a seat. We stayed in a Roosevelt Suite which while nicely sized, is DESPERATELY in need of a dresser or chest of drawers somewhere, anywhere. There is this long, weird desk-like table near the half bathroom - throw some drawers over there so a person can unpack! And the master bathroom is way too small relative to the size of the suite - and this is coming from an NYC family who is very well-versed in tiny spaces.

toadsoup,763,"Chicago, Illinois",2018-03-31,FAMILY,2018-03-31,4,Enjoyable visit,"Enjoyed this historic hotel.  Staff was friendly, room was nice, and our wish for a lower floor was granted.  The only drawback is that there was little to no information in the room (nor were we informed by reservation desk) of nearby restaurants, tours, or locations of the bars/restaurants that were in the hotel itself - other than a one page hotel phone info sheet and a room service menu. We have family in the area who did take us around LA (plus I visited LA many years ago) but for tourists that are coming in LA for the first time, they are on their own.  I have been to many hotels around the world that offer a city guide/magazine with tourist and dining information.  This place surprisingly had none.  The only literature was in a drawer by the bed stand for premier luxury hotels around the world - nothing to do with the hotel or Los Angeles.   We had to ask the front desk for directions to certain places - what bars or restaurants were in the hotel, etc. Even other hotel guests had asked US where they could find the breakfast place.  But other than this glitch, we found the hotel very accommodating and lovely.","Quiet in the tower - however, cabanas will be noisy until 2 a.m.",,5.0,,5.0,,5.0,Sebastian K,Front Office Manager,2018-04-02,"toadsoup,

We chose Hollywood Roosevelt since it was  in the middle of the action.  We had a room facing away from Hollywood Blvd, so it was quiet and the entrance is in the back and not noisy.  Hollywood blvd is a lot like Times Square.  Very noisy and crowded.  We were across from Madame Tussaud’s and the Chines theater.  It was fun to walk along the Hollywood walk of fame and see the celebrities footprints in front of the Chinese theater, since they were right outside of our hotel. Room was small but very nice.  Had a lot of liquor and food items to buy in your room.  Would have liked a HR tee shirt no need for hat or a bag.  We had dinner in main dining room. Server was friendly and food was good. Ate 3 breakfasts in  the front restaurant called 25 degree and had very good breakfasts.  Bill, a security person ,  showed us around for a few minutes and gave us a little history.  Did not have the time or weather to go to the pool, but a beautiful outdoor space and there is a bar and dining outside.   Found all the staff friendly and helpful.

Enthroned on Hollywood boulevard amongst star legends, the Roosevelt impresses. The glamorous decor of the 1920s is well preserved and enticing both in the lobby and the rooms. Service is on par, with helpful and friendly personnel. Our king size bed room was compact but well appointed, although we would not recommend paying a premium for it. The pool site is welcome after a busy day, but most likely gets crammed during busy summer tourist season. Be warned: marijuana is now legal in California, and during our stay it’s smell was often present on hotel premises.
After a couple nights spent here, we were happy to leave the noisy and frantic surroundings of Hollywood.

Yet somehow I am a little disappointed.   I think the issue is that the hotel is a historic building whose guest rooms are a bit small and choppy by modern standards.  Our King Suite had a very large, but very separate living room.  Not terribly comfortable and because the space wasn’t integrated with the sleeping area we didn’t use it as much as one would expect.  The bathroom was not befitting a suite either.  No tub, only one sink.  No reason to splurge on that.  Stick with king deluxe room - unless you’re traveling with a group or having meetings.

We were worried about street noise so requested a back facing room which had an average view but at least was quieter. The rooms are beautiful and feel like high quality especially  the solid wood flooring and beautiful mini bar. Bathrooms are also really great. Been traveling for 2 weeks and these are the most comfy beds by far! On site eating options were also a god send when you don’t want to leave the room after a long day. We were given complementary WiFi, which is great as I was ready to complain about paying $10 in this review! 

My only complaint was that front desk service was hit and miss, got some helpful people, but also got some abrupt unhelpful people who made me feel like a burden for asking what their late check out policy was. 

Only advice to others would be that the immediate street area is a little rough, yes is the smack gang center of action and very very well located, but be prepared for a lot of people hassling you to for tours, lots of loud music from stores, and lots of homeless/mentally ill people in the immediate vicinity of the hotel.

We were in Room 619 which had a view out to Hollywood Blvd and Grauman's Chinese Theater. The room is close to the elevator and I was concerned about noise - but the room was exceptionally quiet.
We had 2 double beds which were quite comfortable. The bathroom was modern, if a bit small. The only complaints about the room is there was very limited closet space and there was no chest of drawers for unpacking. There's also no place to eat a meal.
We ordered room service twice - once for dinner and once for breakfast. Both times the food arrived sooner than advised and it was hot & delicious. The housekeeping staff were friendly and responsive.
The lobby is beautiful, and even though so much was going on at the hotel, it was never crowded or noisy. Every morning there was a complimentary coffee & tea set up  on the bar in the lobby. There were complimentary newspapers available on the credenza in 25 Degrees. Nice amenities.
We enjoyed the Spare Room which has a 2-lane bowling alley original to the hotel. The Library Bar is worth a visit - it's a craft cocktail bar. And we were able to peek into what used to be Teddy's Bar facing Hollywood Blvd. All so very cool.
The concierge service was exceptional - always there to open car doors and provide umbrellas when it was raining. Will was especially helpful to us during our stay.
Lastly, the location is perfect for the Hollywood scene. We had tickets to the Kelly & Ryan after-Oscars show on Monday morning at the Dolby Theater, which is essentially across the street from the hotel. We also had tickets to the Jimmy Kimmel Green Room Monday night - the Kimmel theater is just a 1/2 block away.
In sum, we had a wonderful stay at this beautiful and iconic hotel. I highly recommend staying here.",,5.0,5.0,,,,5.0,Sebastian K,Front Office Manager,2018-03-12,"Dear MaryEhret,

Roshini G,12,,2017-12-31,FAMILY,2018-03-07,5,Steeped in history,"The Hollywood Roosevelt takes you back in time as you step through its wooden doors. IImmaculately preserved it is a monument to the history of Los Angeles and in fact the USA. It is the oldest operating hotel in Los Angeles. Dark woods and antique furniture makes the hotel lobby a scene out of a classics movie and in December, the warmth of the giant Christmas tree and its old time, fire place ambience makes this a special place to be at. It’s rumored that the ghost Marilyn Munro has been spotted at her favorite poolside suite 1200 where she used stay in her hay day.

Don’t miss out on an eclectic dining experience at the Public Kitchen & Bar, a warm, classic and interesting dining space that’s relaxed enough to accommodate even young diners. With exquisite food and excellent service and an even more amazing ambience, The Roosevelt is a must visit/stay at landmark on Hollywood!",,,,,,,,Sebastian K,Front Office Manager,2018-03-12,"Roshini G,

ALeamas,22,"London, United Kingdom",2018-02-28,FAMILY,2018-03-06,5,Oscar Magic at The Roosevelt!,"Throwback to Hollywood history and an exceptional service to back it up! This was my second trip to LA in five months and The Roosevelt was my first choice each time. It has never disappointed. The hotel has retained its Hollywood 1920s ambience and you can feel the history the moment you walk in to the lobby. A good hotel needs quality staff and The Roosevelt wins there as well. A special shout-out to hotel manager Francis and who was patient, professional and courteous. I was there in Oscar week and he treated me as well as any celebrity. For my last visit, I had a room overlooking the pool. This time, I was on the 10th floor in a studio and the room was spotless, the bed incredibly comfortable and the view across LA was stunning. For the price, the Roosevelt is excellent value for money. The only negatives were the erratic wi-fi, which really needs attention and proper investment, and I felt a little ripped off by the $45 nightly fee for parking my car in the hotel car park - seems a little harsh when I was staying there. That is probably the general rule for all the LA hotels. Either way,  The Roosevelt is my go-to when I'm in town and there are hotels opening all the time. Nothing compares to value for money, location or history. When you walk through the doors, you step back in time and you sense the past around every corner. The venue for the first Oscar ceremony in 1929 (The Blossom Room), Marilyn Monroe's home for two years and countless more stories, this really is a Hollywood pearl and long may it stay that way. 10/10 for the staff - from the cleaning lady who greeted us every morning with a genuine smile and hello, to the professionalism at the front desk - as they are the hotel's beating heart.

It is so central that you can always pop back to change or drop of shopping or a rest.   Rooms are smallish but have certainly had smaller however they are extremely clean and well kept.  Service is not so good except for the cleaning staff whom seem to go out of their way to help (since our first stay I now always take a aussie thank you pack for our housekeeping staff)  Valet staff are the most unhelpful unfriendly that I have come across.  The restaurant is expensive ond overrated, but thats fine as there are sooooo many different eating experiences close by.  Bar/grill food is good but again alittle expensive and staff that dont care but thats fine saves us tipping much.
We have seen a few ""celebrities"" as they quite often host partys etc as you are just across the road from where they do many of the awards night.    We were staying there in Nov 17 and i decided to go back to our room for something

Michele P,6,,2018-02-28,FRIENDS,2018-02-10,1,Very BAD experience wow! Disappointed ,"Stayed here for a weekend commercial shoot.  Wednesday through Sunday stay.  I had the double bed room on the six floor. 

The bed frames stick out some and they are very dark wood therefore we stubbed our toes and banged our shins on them all weekend.

Upon arrival there was no top sheet on either bad we had to actually ask for it.

On The first day my daughter took a shower the tub was clogged and had filled with the water as she showered. The showerhead was also broken and therefore sprayed in many directions.  By the time I wanted to take a shower it was completely clogged. I called maintenance they came up removed the shower head and the drain stopper and left to get parts.  they were gone more than 25 minutes. I had an appointment and couldn't miss it therefore couldn't wait for him to return when I called front desk they had no idea when he will return. I told him I had to shower so I took a shower without a shower head in a very slowly draining tub at this point. 

The television was very glitchy and did not function properly.

The Wi-Fi service is horrible taking many many minutes to load pages.

The pool gave my daughter and her friend repeated rashes and there appeared to be either too many chemicals or some kind of problem in the water.

And the last and most horrible aspect of our trip was Saturday  2/10/18 when we returned from shopping to find a 25+ minute wait to get on the elevators back to our room. To make it even worse I asked where the stairs were and we were told we were not allowed to use the stairs.  therefore we're forced to wait trapped outside of our hotel room for the elevator.

I am extremely disappointed in the quality of this hotel and it's amenities I would not recommend it to anybody.",,,,,,,,Sebastian K,Front Office Manager,2018-03-12,"Michele P,

Thank you for taking the time to share your experience. We truthful take all feedback to heart and as an opportunity to improve the guest experience. On that note, thank you to your review and previous ones, we are happy to inform you of some changes that have already taken place and some that are on the horizon. As of March 1st we have upgraded our entire television system - feature a more immersive guest experience and solving some of the glitches we previous had (as well, guests can now cast from the own devices directly to the TV). As for the internet, our IT company is putting together a heat map for the entire hotel and will update all places of need with updated WiFi routers - which we hope to be fully upgraded in the next few months. 

As for the service/in room issues, no excuse on this as you should not have experienced the issues in the first place and the resolution to the situation should have been much smoother.

-no counter space in small bathroom
-no shower door (ground got wet)
-in room fridge had no room to put anything in since it was full of chargeable drinks

aussiekyl,9,"Gold Coast, Australia",2018-01-31,FAMILY,2018-01-29,5,WOW!,We had a few days in LA on the last leg of a long trip.  We (a family of 5) were exhausted but thrilled to find out our room had been upgraded to the Roosevelt Suite due to the hotel being full.   There was a hand written welcome card already in the room with a box of gourmet cookies and water bottles.  They were filming American Idol (I think) nearby and loads of people were staying at the hotel.   There was the odd excitement of entrants being filmed coming and going and that really added to our stay.  The location is perfect - right across the road from the Chinese Theatre.   The hotel itself is just magical - so much history and charm.  There was no complimentary wi-fi (which had been included at all the hotels we had stayed at along our trip) but this was such a small issue in the overall stay.   We would absolutely stay here again.,,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,,,,,,1

Here are the deets - this is a old boutique hotel so the rooms are small and so are the bathrooms when compared to the newer properties. But room sizes are very comparable to NYC hotels so I don't have too much of an issue with this. The prices are high but that is to be expected. 

The location is fantastic! It's right on Hollywood Blvd and there is dining, coffee shops and a mall right across the street. And for the best part - there is an In and Out burger right behind the hotel 😍

The pool here is a party spot at night so if you like loud music and fun, stay poolside in a cabana. If you are like me, ask for a nice room in the tower away from the noise but watch it all happen from the window. Totally fun.  

Finally the staff. They are great and always willing to help. Guest services team is top notch. Front desk agents couldn't be friendlier.

Upon check-in the member of staff asked us why we had come to LA and we mentioned being on our honeymoon. He gave us 2 vouchers for a free breakfast at 25 degrees the next morning which was a very kind gesture. We were shown to our room which was a stunning cabana overlooking the pool. There was a bottle of prosecco on ice in the room with a lovely note wishing us a Happy Honeymoon.

We really can't fault the hotel or staff. We realised on the first night we had no hot water in our room so we were moved to an identical room straight away.

The hotel is located on Hollywood Boulevard  and also close to Runyon Canyon where we did a hike in the sunshine.

We spent one afternoon relaxing around the heated pool, the waitresses came up to your sun-lounger to offer drinks which is helpful and it's a great atmosphere.

My husband used the dry cleaning service once for a shirt, he left it in the room in the morning and was returned in excellent condition the same evening.

The lift lobby's on the accomodation floors have classic Hollywood photo's with a rich history, each with their own personalised message from the photographer detailing what was happening at the time of the photo and giving a rare inside glimpse into the famous individuals in each shot - well worth a read as you wait for the old lifts to take you where you're going.

Our only let down I would say is the seating around the pool, we went out to relax on one of the days and the hotel seems to lease the pool out for parties, this meant that there was nowhere for the residents to sit? We were really disappointed and so were lots of other guests it seemed as the pool was rented out for the entire 3 days we were there which we were not aware of before arriving at the hotel. We managed to hold on to a few sunbeds and we felt a bit sorry for the staff who were left to deal with the issues.

AlisonTheTraveller,127,"Brisbane, Australia",2017-11-30,SOLO,2017-11-30,5,Love this hotel!,"This was my fifth time staying in this gorgeous hotel. It was only a one night stay at the end of a business trip but well worth it. From start to finish, you are taken care of. The valet staff are very quick to grab your bags for you plus they will happily take them to your room. The reception staff are very friendly and efficient. The rooms are the best part – simply gorgeous! I arrived on an early flight and after checking my bags in, they called me on my mobile when my room was ready which made it easier as I was feeling quite unwell. I was upgraded to a suite so my room was very spacious. The beds are incredibly comfortable and the room itself is very modern with lots of space to store your suitcases. This time and the last time, I was emailed during my stay to see if I needed anything or had any feedback. I don’t know of any other hotel that does that. My room tip is to ask for a room at the back of the hotel (i.e. facing Sunset Boulevard). You will be greeted with an amazing sunrise every morning and if you’re an amateur photographer, one of the best features is that you can open the windows about three inches which is enough to put your camera through to capture the beauty. The sunsets are also pretty special. There’s a full mini bar which makes it easier when you’re unwell and don’t wish to step out. The hotel is right in the heart of Hollywood with the TCL Chinese Theatre across the street, the Hollywood and Highland Centre next to that and the famous foot prints, hand prints and stars are right outside. The Hop On Hop Off bus stop is across the street as well and that makes it very easy to get around. If it’s your first trip to Hollywood, I think this hotel is amazing to stay at.

Jenna H,22,,2017-11-30,FRIENDS,2017-11-18,4,More for the experience ,"We came up for the Vulture Film Festival to see the Scandal cast and decided to spend the night. It was on my friend's bucket list to stay here, so we decided to make a weekend of it. 

First off, we arrived very early (around 10:30am for the festival) and a room was ready. Also, everyone we came in contact with from the valets to the reception folks were very friendly and nice!

The pool was very nice and relaxing. The lounge chairs were great for napping in! 

A couple negative things include parking at $46 per day (pretty pricey when you already pay $300 for a room). The elevators were slow and small (but guessing they are original). Finally, there is no jacuzzi or hot tub (which would have been a great addition to our stay). 

While it was a cool experience to stay here, we would probably choose to stay at other hotels in the future. ",,,,,,,,Bre S,Guest Relations Manager,2017-12-04,"Jenna H,

When we were built in 1927 we didn't have a pool and then in 1950 the cabana area became available and I think they wanted a larger pool rather than a pool and hot tub - we do have the 2nd largest pool for a hotel in LA!

We usually get upgraded to a suite, and I must say, it sometimes feels too big. I mean, at ~$200/night, getting a large suite with a bedroom, a walk in closet, and a gigantic living room, feels like I should be paying a lot more. Outside the room, definitely put some time on your calendar to explore the bars and hangout by the pool.

As I couldn't see any itches, I thought it was some bleach or treatment that the hotel put on the sheets. On the second night, I woke up at 4am, all covered up with itches, bed bug itches (unfortunately, I've had some ten years ago, and I recognize the red warm zones with one or many bites in the middle). I warned the reception desk, they came to the room, checked the sheets, said they didn't find anything significant and proposed me, as the hotel was sold out that night, to bring me a small bed. I couldn't sleep because of the itches anyway. For the last night, they moved me to another room, but refused to give me a proper compensation, saying that they called a third party comapny (on Sunday) that said there were no insects. I said that there should be something, as I was all covered with itches after two nights and that they had to determine what bit me. As I was insisting, they sent me to a walk in clinic, and the doctor examined me and said it was insect bites and that it looked like bed bugs bites. I came back to the hotel with the letter from the doctor, the hotel called the head of security, who said that there were no proof that it happened in the hotel, even if I warned the reception in the middle of the night. That it could have happened outside. This dishonest rethoric was very harmful. I'm an actress and a film producer, couldn't work properly because of that while I was in LA, have a casting today and have to hide all the itches.

Once again we apologize for the discomfort you had during your stay. As we discussed there were no signs in your room of any form of infestation and the note you provided us with merely stated that there were bug bites that could have been bed bugs, just as they could have been any other form of biting bug. We also had a third party come in to check the room and they reported the room was in perfect standing; additionally the room has been occupied since without incident. 

We are always glad to assist and make the situation right for our guests, and we even extended two complimentary nights as an apology for the discomfort you had despite the fact there was no evidence then nor since that your original room had an infestation.

If you wish to discuss this matter further please reach out to me directly.

You can’t beat The Roosevelt for location and local color.  It is steeped in the history of Hollywood and located right in the heart of things - just across from The Chinese Theatre.  If you don’t stay up until the wee hours, request a quiet room since things keep going until late.  The rooms are quite nice and the staff very helpful.  One main complaint - in our section there were only two elevators for eleven plus floors.  When we were ready to check out, one elevator was out  of service due to a set up in the penthouse.

My wife and I spent 9 days in Southern California at the beginning of September and the final 3 nights of our stay were spent at the Hollywood Roosevelt.  I had previously stayed here before (2001-ish) and knew that it was in a great location to visit the surrounding areas.

My wife was a little concerned about the price, but this was her first trip to California and I wanted her to stay in a location where both Hollywood and it's history collided.

We were upgraded to room 1221 which is basically the top floor.  My wife who was still skeptical even upon entering the hotel was completely won over when she entered the room.  This particular room had a view of the Hollywood sign directly out the windows and looked down upon the Chinese Theater.  The room was very nice and very clean.  The bed was nice and large and there was also a desk, a mini-fridge, couch, and an assortment of items that could be purchased from both the mini-fridge and the display on top.  The room we had was well maintained and didn't have any signs of wear or minor damage that I can remember.

It was incredible to wake up each morning and look out at the Hollywood sign.  Just by my wifes initial reaction to the room, I knew that I had made the right choice with this hotel.  It is right on Hollywood Blvd. and adjacent to the Chinese Theater.  You can walk directly out onto the Walk of Fame and it's a very short walk to the Dolby Theater, Mels Diner, Hollywood Bowl, and other attractions.

We didn't have time to swim, but we did visit the pool for a short while as well as mingling in the lobby area (which I do believe was the reception area back in 2001...that is now all moved downstairs).

I think the only complaint that I would say I had was the pillows.  They were so soft that it was almost as if you weren't laying on anything, but truthfully that would not stop us from staying there again.

The hotel does offer valet parking which if I remember correctly was $43 a day with unlimited ins and outs.  It is a bit pricey for parking, but I was renting a car and had to park somewhere.  The valets were all very friendly and willing to help with any luggage we had.  They were also very prompt when retrieving our vehicle.

I do highly recommend staying at the Hollywood Roosevelt if you get the chance.  It is very modern and well kept.  It's location is also very hard to beat and has easy access to a lot of the local attractions as well as the 101 Freeway.",Higher floors are probably quieter than lower ones.

The rooms in the main hotel or tower are really nice modern and comfortable. Our room had a really incredible view of the walk of fame and the Chinese theatre. That room was small but totally fine. In our 2nd visit we were in a “cabana” room. Those rooms are around the pool. We were put in a room that did not face the pool with a terrible view but that turned into a huge blessing since the noise around the pool is a lot. The cabana room was much larger than the room we had in the tower. The hotel is really cool and feels very old Hollywood.

It captures the essence of the golden age of Hollywood, when Marilyn Monroe would have been around. The old Lobby is incredible and jaw dropping, whilst the main lobby also depicts the character of the hotel. The pool here is the selling point really. It has a lovely, relaxed feel away from the hustle and bustle of Hollywood Blvd. The only downside to this hotel is the rooms are very small with not much storage space. Also whilst we were staying there was an event meaning the main lifts were not in use. Instead we were made to use the service lift, which was fine but some customers were definitely unimpressed.",,3.0,5.0,,,,3.0,Bre S,Guest Relations Manager,2017-12-04,"Charlotte S,

The view included the famous Hollywood sign. We really enjoyed the pool itself, as well as the poolside movie screening: movie, cocktails, popcorn, heaters when the evening turned cool-excellent! (We'd love to stay in a pool-side cabana next time.) Runyon Canyon is only 5 minutes away. The nearby train takes you directly to Universal Studios.  The hotel and/or guest relations staff went to great effort to ensure we enjoyed our stay: They put up the ping pong table when our son needed activities and helped with bookings to a Lakers game (great seats), tours and restaurants, such as The Ivy. The in-house dining options are all worth trying-we loved our meal at Public. The Spare Room bar with the bowling alley looks fabulous and fun, but was too crowded when we were able to go. So we spoilt ourselves with a cocktail in the gorgeous lobby. (On the odd occasion we did need some patience, when the lifts in this popular hotel were too crowded.) Only real disappointment: we didn't see a ghost!  (Although one evening there was, unfortunately, a shooting between rap artists outside on the Boulevard that our son witnessed-thankfully from the safety of our room.)

A few small things were a tad annoying: one of the elevators wasn't in service, and I suspect the elevators are slow enough when they're all functioning, so it took forever to get to and fro our room. The burger joint, 25 Degrees, had horrible service. The bathroom could have really used a fan (after being in the shower for a few minutes the room got extremely steamy and took a long time to go back to normal!) The staff were so lovely and kind to us - very friendly and helpful. The pool area was beautiful and very quiet - we regretted only checking it out on our last day!! The bed was very comfortable. The TV was too far from the bed which was annoying, and not having free Wi-Fi seemed crazy to us since it seems to be available everywhere in Europe and Canada. The Wi-Fi was a major deterrent for me and really frustrated me. All in all though, it was a great stay and a wonderful location.

It’s not hugely upmarket but it ticks the boxes. Car park, pool, sunloungers, comfortable beds. 
Rooms okay, clean, tidy functional. Had to live out of suitcase, wardrobe non existent. 
Best of all two bathrooms, heavenly. 

Arrived very late at night, reception charming, no one to open doors bit disappointing only seemed interested in whether u needed luggage services. 

Bar drinks super expensive. Didn’t eat at hotel plenty places nearby. Would I go back, actually pool very tempting.
Also jet lag gives you the most incredible sun rises, October around 6.25am. 

Notes, use uber here they are super efficient. 
Pre book airport transfer, it’s a zoo.
Do not lose small ticket from immigration control as you will not get out of airport without it.
It’s 50 min transfer from airport as traffic is so heavy. 
Venice beach near airport, train service available as uber about $30. ",,,,,,,,Bre S,Guest Relations Manager,2017-11-19,"edinburghcitymom,

We were built in 1927 and truly have tried to keep the hotel as historic as possible so believe it or not, no two rooms are the same.

The hotels are more expensive than nearby Burbank and other than the marginal benefit of staying close to the Chinese Theatre, the walk of fame etc, you will get far better value by choosing somewhere in Burbank where we stayed at the Best Western and were not hassled when we left the hotel.  Having said that, the swimming pool and the general surroundings in the Hollywood Roosevelt were fantastic and you are staying in a hotel still frequented by the rich and famous.  My advice is to decide what you want to do and if you are not planning on spending much time at the hotel, stay in Burbank. If you want to stay in Hollywood, this has more atmosphere than the nearby Loews which in comparably priced.",,,,,,,,Bre S,Guest Relations Manager,2017-11-19,"rustygrecian,

SHEILA S,30,"Laceby, United Kingdom",2017-10-31,COUPLES,2017-10-11,5,Amazing stay at a beautiful hotel!,"We stayed at the hotel for 7 nights and from the moment we arrived to the moment we left we were made to feel very welcome. All the staff was amazing especially Bryce and Dennis as they went above and beyond. Dennis walked us to the tube station from the hotel just when we were enquiring about getting to universal studios and told us exactly what to do to get our tickets for the tube and Bryce arranged for us to see the Gable and Lombard Suite and showed us also around the Marilyn Monroe suite which we thoroughly appreciated as we love the old movies and this was a truly amazing experience. We were upgraded for my birthday to a studio king which was huge and the biggest shower we had ever seen and on a high floor as requested with a perfect amazing view of Hollywood boulevard, the Hollywood sign and Graumans Chines theatre. We watched stars arriving for the premier of Marshall and also live filming of Lethal weapon the series from our window and we sat hours watching everything on Hollywood Boulevard. Chocolates were also left in the room as a birthday treat which was a lovely touch. Thank you to everyone at the Hollywood Roosevelt for making our stay such a memorable and perfect trip.","High floor looking over Hollywood boulevard, studio king",,5.0,,5.0,,5.0,Bre S,Guest Relations Manager,2017-12-03,"Sheila164,

Tam,16,,2017-10-31,COUPLES,2017-10-10,4,"Cool, hip and great hotel!","Stayed here two weeks ago while on our West Coast honeymoon tour and it was great fun!
My husband and I are both in our late 20's and this hotel was right up our street! 
After always wanting to go to Hollywood since a young age, I was so excited to be staying on the Hollywood walk of fame at such an iconic hotel! Hollywood itself- I will get to shortly...
Upon arrival we were upgraded to a Poolside Cabana room (originally we had booked a non pool facing cabana room) which was great! We were also given a bottle of water and a box of chocolates and a nice little note by the staff which was cute. We were room 205 on the upper floor and we loved it! 
The first night we arrived from San Francisco we were very tired and wanted to go and grab a bite to eat and then relax ready for our first day in the city. 
There were plenty near by restaurants/fast food chains, a few that were however questionable. I did not feel safe walking the streets at night, and was shocked at how many homeless people there were in the area as well as the amount of people doing drugs in public or absolutely off their faces. But that is where the Roosevelt is GREAT! There is no need to leave! (we did on more than one occasion but tried to avoid it late at night) 
There are great bars, restaurants and places to explore in the hotel itself. While food and drink is pricey, we fully enjoyed ourselves. 
I have read a few reviews about the music/noise inside the hotel. On our first night when we wanted to  have an early night we thought this was going to become a problem as we had a speaker for the Tropicana Pool Bar outside on the side of our balcony. The music stopped at 2am and we slept fine. 
On our second day we got the vibe of the hotel more and decided to just go with it and we ended up spending our evenings sat on the balcony having a few drinks before going down to the bar for atmosphere and louder music! The place is full of posers/""celebrities"" but its all part of the fun. We were there for us not  and not to find the best lounger round the pool for a selfie! (lol) 
The staff were great and really friendly, which helped soften the blow of the $160 a night holding deposit we had to pay upon check in! (more on that to come...)
We had a bunch of PAINFUL American girls moved into the room next door on our second till last day, who constantly screamed, screeched and shouted from 3pm in the afternoon till late evening. It got to a point we could not hear our own conversation due to the noise from the room next door. We had no other choice but to go to reception and complain. They were very understanding and apologetic and requested security went to their room to tell them to keep the noise down. 
The noise did lessen for a bit, until more and more guests entered the room for what seemed to be some form of party. My guess, there were around 20 people pre-drinking in that one room. We had no other choice but to try and ignore and sit on the balcony to enjoy our Sangria. A girl from next door popped her head round, clearly following the visit from security, and explained how it was their friends bday and if they were to noisy to knock on the door and tell them. Much to our surprise they looked late 20's-30's some of them, and were not infact screaming school girls! She left us a shot of tequila on our balcony as a gesture. We ended up having a great night again down at the bar and perhaps the alcohol helped us sleep well that night because we weren't disturbed!
The music at the bar was great, infact REALLY great! So much good music was played all day and at night, which is why we weren't bothered about venturing out at night. 
The pool played relaxed balearic beats during the day which was great! The loungers were comfy, the waitresses were attentive, and the food and drink great! Would more could you want?!
We did have a bit of trouble getting our deposit back once we got back home, and infact the hotel took more money from our registered card, apparently to round the amount up and they refunded it back again with the deposit. Seemed a bit back handed doing this, but was advised by the bank this is not unusual for American hotels...

The vibe of the hotel is very relaxed, trendy and chic and you need to just go with the flow. I would recommend any friends to stay here as it was great.. can imagine the late music wouldn't be everyone's cup of tea perhaps those of an older generation wouldn't be a fan, but we loved it!",,5.0,5.0,,,,5.0,Bre S,Guest Relations Manager,2017-11-19,"Taylor H,

We love the sound of ""WEST COAST HONEYMOON!"" We feel so special that you picked our hotel for such a memorable time in your lives. We always tell people, ""Once you arrive to the hotel, there really isn't a reason to leave, why we have.... bowling, swimming, six bars, four restaurants, the list goes on and on"" Sounds like you figured that out and truly enjoyed the hidden oasis in the midst of Hollywood. 205 is a great room, you to open your door and just enjoy the view of palm tress and sunshine. You two seemed to do it right with the balcony and sangria! Glad to hear your neighbors ended up being ok as well as the music. We shared this feedback with our security team as we never want our rooms to become party rooms. We truly hope we will welcome you back for your anniversary year after year! ",4

emmmmajoooo,1,"Adelaide, Australia",2017-10-31,FAMILY,2017-10-08,5,The BEST location for the hollywood experince!,"I am just writing to praise the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel on their excellent accommodation. 

My mother, sister and I stayed at the hotel for 4 nights. We have not one bad word to say about our entire stay! 

The location is amazing! Right in the heart of Hollywood. Attached to the hotel is one of the best burger places I have ever eaten at “25 degrees”! Delcious food, tasty drinks and the best service! 

When checking in, I was lucky enough to be served by the ever so lovely Brenna, who made sure to accommodate all of our needs. Brenna made sure we were placed in a room situated away from the noise of the pool, to ensure we would have a peaceful nights sleep. She also confirmed a dozen tours we had organised in and around Hollywood. Additionally she recommend the best places to dine, nail salons and spas within the area. Nothing was to much for her! She gave me ample amounts of time and not at one point did I feel rushed. 

She continued to check in with us throughout our 4 day-stay ensuring everything was okay. 

I would also like to take the opportunity to thank all the staff at the Roosevelt for our amazing stay. Everyone from the bell boys (the tall one was extremely nice, I feel so bad I didn’t get his name) the pool staff and room servers. 

Your staff are all excellent workers and should all be rewarded for their extremely high standard of customer service.

Across the street from the Dolby theater and the Hollywood walk of fame. Only negative is that we had a balcony which overlooks the pool and the music was nonstop. We were told ahead of time when we checked in that it can be loud,  but I never realized the music would continue from 3 PM until 2 AM. First night we asked for a change  of rooms which we did get free of charge in the tower section. Overall hotel is   pretty good value .

No, it’s not like being at home, and no, it’s not the same as, say, a ski lodge in the Rockies. But the Roosevelt at Christmas, on Christmas Eve, is about as close as you can get to the real thing in Hollywood. For Californians who don’t know what the real thing looks like, please see Hallmark Channel. Hotel Roosevelt provided non-stop Hollywood classics like “Christmas Vacation” and “A Christmas Story” under the intricately painted canopy of the lobby. A projector made silhouette snowflakes dance like sugarplums. The thoughtful staff provided by mulled cider, popcorn, peppermint sticks, and hot chocolate. Hunkering in the festooned lobby - away from rushed shoppers and the angry throng at the Jewish deli -  felt almost like being snowed in at home, snuggling up to watch sappy movies on DVD just like we do in the Heartland.",,,5.0,,5.0,5.0,,Juliana P,Guest Relations Manager,2017-10-07,"JoePennington,

Kirill O,6,"Melbourne, Australia",2017-10-31,COUPLES,2017-10-01,4,Do not stay in the cabana rooms unless you are in LA to party ,"We stayed at the Roosevelt hotel for 4 nights at the end of September. We chose the cabana rooms due to the close proximity to the pool. We were warned that their maybe ""some"" noise coming from the pool area which is fair enough. We couldn't hear anything on the first night at all but on the second night (Tuesday) there was a movie screening from 9 to 11. This is ok but we had no warning of this as we would've happily joined the session and there were no spare seats by the time we got home and found out there was a movie on. In saying this the speakers were on full blast so even with the door closed which had great soundproofing it was still loud in the room. After the movie concluded the music was still playing very loud but I thought they were just winding down the movie. At 1130 I rang the hotel reception and they had explained that a club open until 2 am at the pool area. I advised them that the music was extremely loud and it was completely inappropriate and there was actually no one by the pool area any more. After going back and forth a few times I spoke to Francis and he was extremely helpful and apologetic and the music was turned off completely within about 10 minutes and the following day we were upgraded to a suite in the main tower. Everything in the hotel was at a high standard including the pool and staff. ",,,,,,,,Bre S,Guest Relations Manager,2017-10-26,"Kirill O,

MarkOz05,4,"Melbourne, Australia",2017-09-30,FAMILY,2017-09-30,5,Conveniently located & friendly staff,"My family and I kicked off our three-week USA holiday in LA staying at The Hollywood Roosevelt.  The hotel is conveniently located close to all of LA’s must-see attractions and a short ride away from places like Universal.  We found all the staff to be super friendly.  In particular, our experience of the city was enhanced by the advice and assistance from Mark Rayder, the Bell Captain at The Hollywood Roosevelt.  We ended up waking up each morning and running our plans by Mark, he advised on places to eat and best mode of transportation and additional things to see in the areas we were visiting.  All his advice was spot on and really did add to our experience.  Mark is absolutely an asset to The Hollywood Roosevelt. 
Although staff were very pleasant and helpful at other hotels; we didn’t experience anyone like Mark again in any of the hotels we stayed at in the other cities we visited.

I'd read the reviews with concerns regarding the party pool and cannabis etc, the pool area was busy on the long weekend we were there but we were alway given entry and felt comfortable. The cocktails and pool menu were unbelievable. At times there was a woft of pot, but that happens all over California and wasn't a concern. We weren't impressed with the room initially allocated to us , but more then impressed with our new room which was huge and stunning with views of the Hollywood sign. We also felt Room Service was good value and so yum.

Glen Campbell,130,"Sydney, Australia",2016-10-31,COUPLES,2017-09-20,5,Simply the best !!!,"Stayed in one of the suites and was VERY impressed.  Room size was massive and the quality/cleanliness could not be faulted.  Had 2 full bathrooms and enough room to play BBall if i had wanted :)

Found the staff to be falling over themselves to be helpful and were some of the most courteous i have ever experienced.

Ate poolside and was really impressed with the food quality (and size was massive - ordered like we would in Aussy and had way too much food to eat).

There was a private pool party when we stayed - but house guests were still allowed to go to the pool area - so mixed it up like a local celeb.

The location on the strip could not be better - you walk out the door and you are right in the middle of everything.

Knowing that the place hosted the first Oscars was a bit of a buzz.  Also sat in the room at one stage and wondered who might have stayed in it over the years.

They leave 8 sunbeds for all hundred-something guests of the hotel. The room was nice.

Kelvin Khoo,50,"Singapore, Singapore",2017-09-30,SOLO,2017-09-11,3,No Big Deal,"Stayed at the Hotel from 3 - 6 Sep due to a Company Convention, extended on my own from 6 - 10th. Originally wanted to stay at W Hollywood but all the negatives reviews and mainly from SPG Platinum Members frightened me, also ruled out Loews as its a Business Hotel so thought a hotel with rich history like Roosevelt will suit me better, coupled with great location.

Wrong choice! Hotel don't provide drinking water but a lot of Evian Bottles available for sale. Mini Bar Fridge is filled to the brim leaving me no space to use the fridge at all. Lift stinks because of the wood flooring and walls; smelt like fish or people who had been perspiring stuck in the lift.

Rooms were of great size and toilet facilities were complete but didn't include shower gel. My Room, 406, was noisy as ever in the toilet with a motor sound buzzing during my entire stay! Nothing was done despite bringing it to Front Desk's attention.

My greatest disappointment: NO BREAKFAST! Can you beat that??? No buffet breakfast but they didn't have a restaurant that really provides breakfast too! Acclaimed amenities of Free Coffee/Tea: great selection of tea but they left one flask of hot water in the bar area but with no one attending to it. Once its empty, good luck to you! For a Hotel of this age and history, the software, the people, is way lacking!

Reading the other reviews, some say that they had incredible service at the hotel, and other say that the staff was totally uninterested in helping them.  I think they're both right. 

When we checked in, the front desk and bell staff were warm, friendly, helpful -- it was great! But for the rest of our stay, the staff made it feel like we were inconveniencing them by asking for anything. They would do the barest minimum to help, though they did seem to be having a lot of fun talking to each other. That was especially true at the pool and (again) the front desk.

The staff was pretty disinterested in helping with anything other than the bare minimum. They did fulfill requests but like it was a chore. Nobody ever smiled.

We booked the king suite, which has a separate bedroom. We were traveling with a baby, and I asked for a quiet room. The receptionist put us on the fifth floor and assured me it would be quieter than a higher floor because the ""sound bounces off the higher floors"" or something. I've lived in NYC, which has more tall buildings, and this isn't really true, but we got stuck with the fifth floor suite.

We get in and the room is beautiful... and the street noise is loud. All it took is a loud horn from Hollywood blvd to wake our sleeping baby. Super fun way to spend a vacation.

Anyway, this is a mixed review. The property is gorgeous, and the room itself is really nice, understated but elegant. We had a good time at the pool early in the morning. But there were leftover crackers on the couch from the previous guest that wasn't cleaned. It's just lacking in details, sloppy in service, and the general attitude is that they didn't care if we were there or not.

When my husband & I arrived late that night after our wedding, we immediately ordered room service (which arrived promptly), a hamburger with fries as well as chicken fingers. The food was piping hot & simply delicious. The next morning,'we both equally fell in love with the pool. Never have we ever felt more at home in a hotel in all our lives! Would recommend; will most definitely be back. I am sure every day at the Hollywood Roosevelt is like mini-honeymoon.",,,,,,,,Bre S,Guest Relations Manager,2017-10-26,"Melanie F,

Porphyrius,2,"Hollywood, California",2017-09-30,FAMILY,2017-09-01,5,I've never felt so thankful 😢🇺🇸,"Today was an epic day thanks to the Roosevelt staff. Javier has trained his people to the utmost standards of hospitality. BRENNA and NICOLE I believe we're at the front desk, welcoming in my friend. 
We walk in loud laughing and full of excitement the staff smiles at us both LOOK AT US like we're celebrities. We ask about a room because it is over 100 degrees in Hollywood on Sept 1st, 2017. (REMEMBER IN SUMMER THE ROOSEVELT HAS AC!) We get our room and my buddy Ryan is missing a leg. He needs a lot of pillows to sleep. I request extra pillows the ladies say they will handle it not to worry! I then explain Ryan got blown up in Afghanistan 🇦🇫 and his leg was amputated and his nerve damage is so bad that need to clip his finger nails sometimes on his hands. The girls with watery eyes said thank you for you're service. I then explained we haven't seen each other in five years since the Corps. They said if we need anything let them know. 
I come back from retrieving Ryan's back pack from his truck. (He's missing a leg) I then request a blanket for Ryan. He says it's easier for him to sleep with a blanket not a comforter. 
Out of nowhere a card arrived at the door that says ""Enjoy your five year reunion. Thank you for your service. From Brenna and Nicole - Have a drink on us at the bar.""

This is my best friend I went to high school with and it meant so much to me to see other people appreciate him just as much as I do. If you're a veteran and you're having a reunion go to the Roosevelt. They have compassion, they have respect and they have incredible people who actually care. From the Marines... Thank you for incredible service! You're the reason we will fight any climb and place!

Stephanie R,3,,2017-08-31,COUPLES,2017-08-30,2,Not worth the money at all - stay elsewhere.,"There were a few things that didn't really make our stay as enjoyable as we had hoped. 

When we arrived at 4:50pm for check in (1 hour 50 minutes after the check-in time and post a call to say our room was ready), our room was not ready. This turned out to be ok as the front desk staff member upgraded us to a poolside cabana for the inconvenience.

The room however smelt like stale cigarettes which was fairly unpleasant for a non-smoking hotel. We left the door open to air it out and thought it best to just dismiss this and headed out for dinner. 

Unfortunately, when both booking, and checking in, we were never informed that there would be a poolside party until 2am. Having a speaker right above our door meant that sleep wasn't going to be possible at all until then. It would've been good to know this when booking as we likely wouldn't have booked the hotel. Although we booked in on a deal, it is still a bit of money to pay to not be able to sleep. We were thankfully moved to the tower and for this we we're very grateful.  

During check in there was also no information given about the wifi (not free - usually $14.95 per day however complementary in the deal we booked with) or the $25 food vouchers for each day we were at the hotel. I feel like this is fairly poor communication and it was only because I enquired the next morning that we found out we had already missed out on one day of our vouchers. The credit was only added when prompted during checkout. 

For the money that guests pay to stay it was not worth it at all. The pool is beautiful  however there is not much else we will take away from our stay. Terrible food and it's also lacking detail and care when there seemed to be typos in most of the printed collateral throughout the hotel.",Make sure to ask about the pool party if you are booking a cabana and intend to get any sleep during your stay.,,1.0,2.0,,,3.0,Bre S,Guest Relations Manager,2017-10-27,"Stephanie R,

The area is busy, crowded and noisy, especially at night with all the clubs around. It is fun to see the hotel with its tiles and elaborate décor. They have a fitness center and swimming pool, a few restaurants and meeting halls. I found the staff at the reception to be very friendly and helpful.  We were in a spacious suite on the 12th floor. It was pleasantly designed in tones of gray, heavy wood sliding doors to divide the bedroom from the dining/sofa are and wrought iron. I appreciated the black-out curtains. The view is of the city and hills, looking west most likely. It was good to be able to use the sofa as a bed as well and the large dining room table for room service, which was quite good. There is a bar sink, small refrigerator and coffee maker provided.  Closet space is above average. There is a desk but Internet is expensive.  In the “living” area a powder room is convenient as a second bathroom, but without the shower that the bathroom by the bed has. That bathroom is small but has the shower. They provided plenty of towels and toiletries, robes, an ironing board and iron. In one of the closets is a safe.  In both areas, bedroom and “living” area are large screen TV’s. The temperature controls worked well. I slept well. The king size bed was comfortable, though there was a bit of street noise at night. In all it was a pleasant place for a short visit.

The staff were very helpful, friendly & safe which was important to me as I was travelling with my daughter on my own for the first time in LA. The hotel felt like a little oasis in the middle of all of the glitz, glamour and crowds of Hollywood and there were certainly times when I felt as though I had stepped back in time particularly when there was an event held around the pool with synchronised swimmers. The cafe at the front of the hotel did a great breakfasts and the staff there were also quite lovely.

My only criticism would be that as a guest at the hotel I only found out about the event by the pool when I had gone to take some photos of the hotel that morning. I would like to suggest if I could that if you are having events at the hotel that flyers be placed in the guests rooms so that we are aware and don't miss out on a full experience of your hotel.",,,,,,,,Bre S,Guest Relations Manager,2017-10-27,"Catherinelyttle,

The hotel itself is lovely, very stylish, that is until you get to the rooms. 
Our room was tiny and just about accommodated us. The bathroom was awful and very outdated and in need of severe updating. The shower was terrible and the tiles were cracked. Thankfully, we only used the room to sleep in (not to relax in), as we were out most of the time. 
The pool was really buzzing, but the staff seemed only bothered about the adults without kids. I found the attitude of bar staff very rude. 
As mentioned, the location is perfect. Right on Hollywood boulevard which is so much fun. We went to universal studios using uber ($5)!! Better than using our hire car and paying for the car park for $20-50
We also did the Hollywood behind the scenes tour, Sony pictures tour and Warner bros studio tour, which was by far outstanding. 
Griffiths Observatory was a good hike to see the Hollywood sign, but get there well before sunset, otherwise you won't see the sign.

You can hardly tell when your bobbing around in the pool or in one of the bars. Do it, place is tight. That's coming from me, and I generally don't like anything.

HonestTravelling123,27,,2017-07-31,COUPLES,2017-08-15,4,Party hotel with a great location.,"After reading some of the reviews I still went ahead and booked this hotel because it seemed to suit what we wanted...a lively hotel with a good atmosphere in a central location to all the tourist attractions and it delivered on all fronts. You need to be aware when booking that this hotel that it does cater more for the younger clientele, music around the hotel bar goes on till 2am most nights and yes there is often a whiff of smell from people smoking. If you're fine with this then I highly recommend staying. We had a cabana room overlooking the pool which has a small balcony which is great to have breakfast on in the morning. We were treated very well from the moment we got there and all my requests fulfilled for my girlfriends birthday. The rooms are on the small side with limited storage space, however if you're out most of the day enjoying the weather this shouldn't be too much of a problem. The mini bar is well stocked however I am on the side of other guests when saying $10 for a bottle of water is far too expensive and no need for it to be that much. Room service was always very quick and selection solid. The restaurants in the hotel all did nice food, but as you'd expect on the more expensive side. The pool was lovely with a good atmosphere, free drinking water while sunbathing was always appreciated and the servers happy to supply. The only downside to our stay was our treatment by the staff on our last day. We decided to pop to the shops for 30mins and when we got back our possessions had been removed from the sunbeds. Apparently there's a 10 minute rule which had never been highlighted in our whole week long stay, no other beds were offered to us and it left a sour note with me. Despite this I'd recommend for a fun stay in a great location to all the attractions.",,,4.0,4.0,,4.0,,Bre S,Guest Relations Manager,2017-10-26,"HonestTravelling123,

Heather H,8,"Seattle, Washington",2017-06-30,COUPLES,2017-08-09,4,Great service at a classic hotel,"We enjoyed our stay here. The staff was most attentive to our need for a quiet place to rest. After the first night, I asked for a different room and the staff accommodated our needs. 

While we stayed in a suite, the bathrooms were very small. It is an old hotel and either the bathroom sizes are indicative of a different standard from a bygone era, or they were added later. But, the rooms themselves were very nice and the mattresses were good. There is a lovely poolside café. Otherwise, The hotel restaurants served small bites and standard fare.

At 11pm all the management could offer us was a poolside room on the other side of the hotel and this was not appealing considering we were leaving at 7am and would require packing the room up! It was also not appealing to move to a poolside room where earlier in the day I had witnessed weed and other drugs being sold to guests. Whilst it may be legal to smoke weed in California, it is certainly not legal to smoke it on a non-smoking floor where families are staying with their children! 

Management gave a very insincere apology and that is all I got!",,,,,,,,Bre S,Guest Relations Manager,2017-10-27,"James1211346890,

wren76,739,"Derby, United Kingdom",2017-08-31,COUPLES,2017-08-02,2,Over rated and expensive ,"An honest review from us.

From the beginning we are on our honeymoon so to stay at the roosevelt was a very expensive treat and expensive it turned out to be. We got an upgrade to a cabana room straight away which was nice of them. The room wasn't all that and beds were very uncomfortable. Outside our room was the door to that part of the hotel and it kept us awake both nights as it slams every time someone walks through it. A very uncomfortable restless two nights sleep. Everything in the room is expensive like $10 for a bottle of water!! Also valet parking is $45 each day and they don't give you an option not to. $18 for a cocktail!!! $100 to play in the bowling alley!! Why you would
Rip your customers off like that I don't
Know. 

Breakfast in the morning was a joke. 40mins to make some toast at which point my coffee was cold as we had to repeatedly ask for milk. 

The pool area is this place saviour although I wouldn't stay here again I would visit in the day and stay somewhere else. 

It's over priced in my opinion and blatantly ripping off its guests with the prices. 

Thankyou to the pool

However due to our inexperience in the area we wanted something close to where our tour pick up locations were and wanted to avoid the traffic by driving or taking an uber somewhere. In saying this, I really expected more from a customer service standpoint. Our best customer service came from the woman who was cleaning the other rooms when we entered ours. The greeting she gave us was more warm and friendly than the one we received at the front desk.  They were not rude, but they also weren't warm and friendly. The rooms  are decent size and have a nice sliding partition from the bathroom area so someone can get dressed and ready with the light on and not disturb someone who is sleeping. There isn't a microwave and the fridge is stocked with their items for sale so I had to move those around if I wanted to add anything in there. We ate at the 25 degrees restaurant for breakfast and it was good. We also visited The Library Bar which was such a cool concept. The young lady that was bartending  was a little standoffish at the beginning, but once we got to talking with her wound up being very nice and made some amazing drinks. In asking about the hours of The Library Bar from a server in the Lobby bar area we were answered as if this was a ridiculous question we should have known the answer to. Overall the stay was good, but now that I know the lay of the land would I come back? Probably not. There was a Hilton not too far away that is a similar location and probably a better value if you're looking for one. ",,,,,,,,Bre S,Guest Relations Manager,2017-10-25,"C C,

Ellen,50,"Antrim, United Kingdom",2017-07-31,COUPLES,2017-07-25,3,Nice but extortionate,"Lovely hotel. Clean and tidy. Helpful. When we mentioned we were on our honeymoon we got a free bottle of champagne and lovely chocolate covered strawberries. 

Our room was very small. The restroom was tiny. The hotel was very very expensive. Lots of guys around the entrance were very keen to help you but very clearly expecting a tip every time they opened the door for you. 

They don't make it clear but parking is the most expensive in the area. I thought it was free until i spotted a sign saying it was something like $50 dollars per night. Why would any hotel take advantage of their guests so badly?!   I asked if we could move our car to somewhere less expensive. The guy said i could move the car but I wouldn't find cheaper anywhere in the city. That was a lie. I parked it two blocks away on the street for free every night and my car was fine. 

The hotel placed a bottle of water on each table in our room. I thought they were complimentary as they were the only drinks in the room when we arrived. They were $10 each for one small bottle of water! One block away i bought the same sized bottle of water for one dollar. I think it's terrible to overcharge your customers by so much. No hotel can justify charging ten times more than a normal grocery store. I thought that was a horrible way to treat guests and for this determination to maximise profit from guests i would never return to this hotel.

travelingjamie,956,"San Marcos, California",2017-07-31,COUPLES,2017-07-20,3,A Little Underwhelming,"I honestly found my stay at the Hollywood Roosevelt underwhelming for the price.  When you pay $400+ a night for this hotel, I think the ante is upted.  The best thing this hotel has going for it is the location and historic value; it's located across the street from the Chinese Theatre and on Hollywood Boulevard.  The pool seems to be a hotspot in Hollywood, but I can't understand why.  It's a rectangular pool surrounded by hotel rooms with a small bar on the side.  I booked a ""Cabana"" style room, but it didn't include a view of the pool; instead, my view was of apartments across the street.  

Parking is $46.50 a night.  Wifii is not free.  I asked for the wifii code at the front desk, and the receptionist said it doesn't come included with the room but she'd give me a complimentary pass just this time.  Interesting... for $400+ a night, the room should come with free wifii.  

I expected a grandiose lobby, maybe even the ability to access the rooftop to enjoy the potential of a great view of Holloywood Boulevard and that famous ""Hollywood Roosevelt"" sign.  Neither was true.  Why not put a bar at the top of this hotel and capitalize on the view?  The lobby is dark and Spanish style, which I guess has been restored from the hotel's early days.  I get how this is a historic site, but the hotel needs to capitalize on that and make its guests feel like they are getting something for their dollar besides the location.  The rooms were well decorated with mid-century modern touches, although I found damage to our headboard in our room that needs to be fixed.  I couldn't help but notice as I was going to sleep at night. I like to give five stars to hotels when I see value.  I don't mind paying the price when I feel like I'm getting my money's worth. I unfortunately didn't see it in the Roosevelt.",,,3.0,3.0,,4.0,,Sebastian K,Front Office Manager,2017-10-23,"travelingjamie,

Stephanie S,74,"Nottingham, United Kingdom",2017-06-30,NONE,2017-07-14,4,Good with caveats,"The Roosevelt needs to decide how rock and roll it can be at these prices.  We got a great deal by booking months ahead but at rack rate my review would have been different.  it's a beautiful, historic hotel and is in the most brilliant location, right opposite the Chinese Theatre etc.   Our room was comfortable and quiet but tiny and we had a De Luxe Room.   How small is a standard?  it was for three of us and it was hilariously cramped.   The mini bar is one of the most expensive I have seen anywhere in the world, ever.  It may be the most expensive.  Its outrageous.   When we arrived the pool was full of inebriated valley girls in tiny swimsuits, arguing and swearing.   It was about 6.30pm.    Another day our corridor just literally stank of dope.  The smell lingered for three hours.  California has recently relaxed its drug laws but it's unsettling and it's a no smoking hotel so it leaves you feeling a bit vulnerable, especially in a multi-storey hotel.  The hotel is full of history, it's very dark (odd) and it's very stylish.  Most of the staff are very friendly.   The guests were a mix of incredibly rude and really lovely.  The pool is divine but I was too scared to use it once the bar opened after my experience on the first day. In the mornings - it's stunning, spotless and gorgeous. So a mixed bag.   I wouldn't stay there again. ",,,,,,,,Bre S,Guest Relations Manager,2017-10-25," Stephanie S,

brett a,1,,2017-07-31,BUSINESS,2017-07-11,5,I always stay jere,"I travel to LA frequently for business and have stayed here the last few times and will continue to do so. You can enjoy a classic Hollywood experience for little more than you would pay for a budget chain hotel. From the minute you arrive to the moment you leave, you will be warmly attended by any staff member you encounter from valet, check in, restaurant staff, even the housekeeping crew will smile and acknowledge you as you walk by. I lived in Hollywood during my 20s and got to know the hotels history well. Before you visit, do some research on the role this hotel has played in Hollywood's history. It will really add to your experience. The rooms are clean and cozy, each of the restaurants is great, it's close to everything and quieter than you would expect for a hotel in the middle of Tinseltown. My only regret is that I'm usually too busy working during my stay to take more of it in. I look forward to going back. ",,,,,,,,Bre S,Guest Relations Manager,2017-10-25,"Brett A,

It was well worth the wait. If you are looking to stay in LA next to all of the tourist action, this is the place for you. We were able to walk to so many places although it was hard to force ourselves away from the pool to explore. If your goal is just to relax, this is the place to do it. The pool can't be beat. Everyone at the hotel from the valet to the receptionist to the maid was extremely kind to us (and since we were traveling with a toddler, that was most appreciated).

Nikhil S,20,,2017-07-31,COUPLES,2017-07-11,2,Nothing was working in the Room,"I live in Orange County, but decided to stay here as I had tickets for the Book of Mormon at the Pantages for Saturday night. Figured I would make a day of it, use the pool, do some day drinking.

Check in went smoothly. The guy at the front offered us room upgrades, but we declined. We just got a queen studio. 

The pool was nice. It was pretty crowded when we got there. Chill vibe, the weather was really hot. Getting service was near impossible, even having a daybed, I had to go to the bar every time I needed something. 

This was my second time staying at this hotel over the last 6 months. My first trip was adequate, but I literally went to the hotel just to sleep after a night of bar hopping with friends. This time, I actually spent the full day at the hotel.

We entered our room after check in to the room being 80 degrees. Called down to the front desk, they sent an engineer up. Decided to go to the pool. Came back to the room, the temperature had gone down. After coming back from the show, the room was 82 degrees. Called down again, and this time I waited for the engineer. They obviously did not fix the A/C and I could tell all he was doing was spraying a cold foam so that the fan's air was cold. At 3am, woke up, drenched in sweat, the room was back in the 80's. 

The TV did not work when I went to turn it on. Not sure if it was the TV or the remote. I let it go, decided to pick my battles. 

Iron did not work in the room. Had to call to get a new one, which was done promptly.

Please do not stay at this hotel if you want to have a relaxing time. You will constantly find that nothing works. When complaining about the hotel, they just told me, it's an old hotel, things don't work sometimes. That is the lamest excuse and if they could not fix the A/C, they should have offered to move us to a different room instead of pretending to fix it. 

Parking for $42.00 is pretty rough, even though I paid it, there are plenty of other options around if you want to save some money there.","Stay away from room 317.

I am so sorry for your experience, a properly functioning room should be the least of any guests expectations and we clearly did not deliver on this. Additionally, we were not able to provide the type of experience and service that we pride ourselves in.

Leah J,2,,2017-07-31,BUSINESS,2017-07-10,1,The worst front desk/check in/check out service ,"I walked into this stunning Hollywood classic hotel and I was visually impressed. I was approached by a bell boy who was lovely and carried my bags. 
I approached the front desk to check in and I received the most up herself Asian lady concierge. She just didn't want to be there at all. I just got off a 14 hour flight from Sydney and I wasn't in the mood to put up with a front desk lady who thought she was too good to be working there. Well I was told I would have to pay a $450 room deposit/holding bond which was fine but my card had sercurity feature activated and the transaction would not process. Keep in mind I have already paid $1000 for the room in advance, so I offered her a $500 cash deposit until I got in touch with my bank in Australia which she declined. I offered to get her a credit card number by calling my family back home in Australia and putting it in manually over the phone, she informed me she must swipe the card and didn't know how to enter it manually?!?! By this stage I was nearly in tears so I asked for a full refund and I was told I would have to get in touch with my booking agency in Australia and she refused to refund my money. I told her it was 2am back home and wouldn't be possible. I really did not know what to do so I called home in tears and my dad was just about to book a room at Loews when the lady manager offered to accept the cash deposit?!?! This is after an hour of being declined every single thing I could think of. 
So I checked in, room was nice. Facing the Hollywood sign on the top floor which I was told was the best room only to find out there are cabanas by the pool which are way better. 
Lots of model looking girls walking thru the hotel bar and by the pool looking for rich guys. 
The sercurity were amazing, so friendly, kind, humble. Corey the sercurity should be running the hotel, he was so helpful. Also the cleaners were lovely always saying hello with a smile. The front desk staff, the pool check in chic, the pool waitress and the people coming in to use the pool, looking for rich guys to buy them drinks was a big turn off. Everything else was perfect. I would stay here again if I didn't have to deal with the rude staff. I hope you have a better experience. ",,,,,,,,Sebastian K,Front Office Manager,2017-10-21,"Leah J,

Please accept our sincerest apologies for the service issues during your stay. We are taking you experience as a training example on how to handle such situations (procedural, the front desk agent was doing the right thing - but we should have handled the situation in a more human manner from the beginning). 

We truly do hope we will see you again and please reach out to me directly for that future stay and we will ensure that you received the service from start to finish that we strive to provide to all guests.

The rooms are pretty small but the balcony makes up for it. The pool is surrounded by rooms and day beds with great music playing. The pool staff was amazing! The guys were so attentive to me and my friends with drinks, ice, etc. The food there is great but the drinks not so much. The $17 bloody Mary's and pina coladas had no flavor at all and were pretty weak. They also add the tip in there so you can't even choose what you'd like to to tip.

Hollywoodland15,1,Connecticut,2016-08-31,FAMILY,2017-07-08,2,Rude to non-guests,"I started staying at the Roosevelt in the late 1990s. Last time we stayed was in 2005. I was leery when the new company took over in 2003 because they removed all the Old Hollywood memorabilia on the second floor. Since then we haven't come back to this hotel and decided to stay elsewhere. 

Last summer while visiting Hollywood we decided to visit the Roosevelt. We had one member of our party that had never been to the hotel or Hollywood. Our very first stop was the Hollywood Roosevelt. After a brief walk around the lobby I wanted him to get a quick peek of the historical poolside. When we approached the pool area desk (before entrance to pool) a young female (20s, dark brown hair, hair pulled back in bun with glasses) asked if we were guests of the hotel. This was on Wednesday July 20 (2016) mid-afternoon, around 3 pm. I explained that I have stayed several times in the past and that I wanted to quickly show the other individual in my party the pool area. She stated that the pool was for guests only. I told her that was fine, we were not going to use it or go in it but just wanted to take a quick peek- right at the end of the ramp from the desk. We had our street clothes on and in no way looked like we were going to be swimming or using the pool in any way. I completely understand this rule and would never use amenities at a hotel I was not a guest at. At first she did not know what to say and looked at this young guy she was talking to at the desk. Then she restated that the pool is for guests only. I was a little taken back since the end of the ramp towards the pool area entrance was only a few feet away. But I accepted it and did not push it with her. While I am sure that the hotel does not want a bunch of “visitors” walking around the pool I don’t think there are that many classic Hollywood history buffs/researchers that ask to take a peek either.  I then shared about the times I came to the Roosevelt in the past and asked if the hotel still had the gift shop off the lobby or the famous Marilyn Monroe mirror that used to be across from the gift shop when it was on the 2nd floor. I could tell that she did not know what I was talking about because this had been several years ago. She would barely answer me and shook her head. I then commented on how much change and construction has taken place at the hotel in the past several years. What disturbed me the most was that she never spoke to me during my exchange with her and when I stopped speaking she said “okay” looking down and then looking everywhere but me. It was similar behavior to how someone would act if a babbling person was talking in front of them or making a scene and someone was just trying to get them away as soon as possible. I have never been so embarrassed, especially in front of the other person in my party since I constantly talked about the Roosevelt to him and how wonderful it has always been. I actually talk to everyone I meet in Hollywood  to share my memories of the Roosevelt. She never directed me to someone else for assistance or even offered me a goodbye or have a nice day. I thanked her and said to have a nice day. She completely ignored me the whole time I was speaking to her, was not interested in what I had to say, or even cared to suggest someone else that could help. I truly believe that she thought I was a crazed individual making up everything I said or at least that is how she treated me. We were going to check out the bar and restaurant options in the lobby but decided against it. I did not feel that we were welcomed at the hotel as non-guests. Funny thing is there are public restaurants at the pool but we were still not ""allowed"" in. 

Sent this complaint to the Roosevelt one year ago and still have not heard anything back. This really makes me never want to come back to this hotel again. Boy, has it changed since the 1990s. Totally ruins the history of this hotel.",,,,,,,,Bre S,Guest Relations Manager,2017-10-27,"Hollywoodland15

Thank you for visiting our hotel for several years as a guest or not a guest you truly find this property to be special and love to tell the story about our historic building. Yes, many changes have taken place and yes, with time things have evolved and made things different. However, this doesn't take away from the fact that our team members should always be  pleasant. We did remove the mirror as it was attracting a large amount of tour groups throughout the lobby area and that took away from our guest experience.  We are trying to protect our hidden oasis (the pool) so that our hotel guest can truly enjoy that amenity. We have public restrooms on the lobby level however. I would be happy to discuss this with you in person or via the phone, whatever is best for you. Please contact the hotel and ask for Bre. ",3

Galen C,5,"San Francisco, California",2017-07-31,FRIENDS,2017-07-05,3,Great! Sort of...,"Location is perfect.  The bars, restaurants, and pool area are fantastic from a looks perspective, very fun.  Have a burger at the 24 hour spot int he lobby...to. die. for.

The service though, was confusing.

Check in was actually great, the Front Desk team was very nice and explained everything well.  The girl that took care of us had beautiful flower tattoos!
When getting to the pool the first time we had a great day of it.  Our server, John or James (sorry!) was amazing and took great care of us.  Bell guys were awesome and very friendly as well.  Kudos to that whole team.  
When going up to the Tropicana host stand I stood there looking around while staff just talked and no one asked me if I needed anything until I interrupted a conversation apologetically to ask about something.  Not the best feeling when you're spending $20 on cocktails each.  Moving right along, everything was fine but the following day, the woman managing the pool check in desk said that we had to put our name down because they were busy, totally fine as it's a hot spot for sure.  She took down my number and said they would text when there was space available and specifically said we were 3rd on the list.  A while goes by and we see a bunch of beds start to free up so I went to ask her, I believe she said her name was Jules, if we could snag one of those if the other two ahead of us weren't there anymore....she then let me know that typically they would charge if you wanted to bump your name up on the list...charge? ok...So after asking how much it was, thinking this was a policy or something, she said ""Well...usually I would get like $100 bucks..."" uh...Did she just ask me for a bribe to get a poolside bed when I was 3rd on the list and a bunch of them just opened up?  Ok...I declined but said we'd wait on that text.

Much later I went up again thinking it had been a while and mystery of mysteries, she can't find our name on the list anymore and of course....has no information in order to text us...interesting given I watched her take down my name and number.  

Now the pool was packed at that point lots of beds had emptied and refilled....not a great feeling to have someone ask for a bribe to provide a hotel guest a basic service and then ""lose track"" of their information after they declined to pay you cash for something we should have gotten free anyhow.....like we had the day previous, mind you.

Anyhow, a great time overall for sure, however under the table nonsense like that is not cute when we were already paying to stay there and willing to spend on cocktails and food etc.  Needs work.

Front Desk and Bell....keep up the great work as you were all so nice.

There were some issues with our stay (which were out of the hotel's control), but it is the way the hotel staff helped us that makes me recommend this hotel to anyone.

I stayed here on the 5th of June, which coincided with city power outages. This meant the hotel ran on a generator at certain times throughout the day.

When we checked in on level 3 - right outside the window was the generator. We called reception and they were very helpful and upgraded us to a king room on level 11. We woke up at 2am as the air conditioner was not working and the room was like an oven (related to the generator usage). The aircon eventually came back on and we were given a complimentary breakfast.

+ The pool area was fantastic ! 
+ Breakfast was also delicious. 
+ The staff were very friendly and helpful. 
+ Location is great

- I reviewed my credit card statement several days after the stay and noticed a separate charge from the hotel. I called the hotel and they informed me that it was a minibar expense (I never take items from the minibar). They reviewed and refunded my credit card. Just be wary of this if staying at this hotel.","Request a room higher up, away from street noise",5.0,5.0,2.0,,,,Bre S,Guest Relations Manager,2017-10-26,"Mlag89,

Staff were really friendly and helpful.
Breakfast at the burger restaurant on site was okay, experience for what you got.
Free tea/coffee available but only until 9am which is poor - people are on holiday and generally have a longer lie in...
Rooms were really quite small but i guess had everything you needed..  cleaned daily and couldn't fault the cleanliness.
Pool area was quiet but again staff were more than helpful and always came over to check if you needed a fresh drink or offer a food menu (the Mac and cheese was amazing!)
Centrally located it can get noisy at night and until around 11pm, especially if you are at the front of the hotel (which has the best views).

Brent D,9,"Los Alamitos, California",2017-06-30,SOLO,2017-06-29,5,Wonderfully Uniquely Hollywood!,"The Hollywood Roosevelt is a hotel unlike any other I’ve stayed at; and I have patronized fine hotels in London, Copenhagen, Stockholm, Oslo, and so on.  Your visit to the Roosevelt will not be the sterile, plastic experience which is the norm at even the “best” hotels in this day and age.  Just like Hollywood stars themselves, the Roosevelt has its own distinct charisma, personality, looks, talents, and drive to appeal to its public. The management has the highest standards, is unfailingly thoughtful and responsive, and things will run smoothly.  Due to its clientele and the celebrity environment, the experience there can at times be serendipitous, quirky, unexpected, and eccentric, but—as with people of proven talent—always delightful, enjoyable, and enriching to those who know how to appreciate real distinction.

Your first choice to be made will be where you want to be in the hotel.  The cabanas (despite the name, they’re not separate little structures), in the pool enclave, obviously partake of the fun-loving poolside atmosphere, which can turn into a pool party as the evening comes on.  It’s usually bustling, has its own bar and café, and can be very noisy, yes, even into the wee hours, because people are there to enjoy themselves!  I myself look on the hotel as a resort in and of itself, and basically stay in and around my cabana 90% of the time, because I’m there to relax and enjoy the summery poolside environment, even when it gets noisy.  But if you’re looking to turn in early and get a good long night’s sleep, and are in Hollywood to spend most of your time away from the hotel seeing sights, you’ll most likely want to be in the “tower” of the hotel, away from the pool (don’t hesitate to specify that having a quiet room is important to you).  Don’t empty out your closets and chests at home and bring your entire wardrobe and all your stuff for your visit.  Going by the accommodations there I’ve experienced, there will be a modest closet with one drawer inside it.  Use your ingenuity to pack just what you need—traveling light will make you feel a sort of freedom, truly a vacation from home.

The rooms are neat and clean, with quality furnishings.  The beds and pillows are unfailingly and notoriously soft and comfortable.  The cabana bathrooms (no experience in the tower) have ample counter space, a big sink, and a clean tiled shower.  Of course, towels and quality soaps, conditioners, and hair dryer are supplied (which reminds me:  there’s also an iron in the closet).  Daily housekeeping is thoroughgoing and of the highest professional quality.  Lighting in the room is ample and appropriate.

Arrival at/departure from the hotel is handled smoothly by the valet service and front desk, with staff anxious to accommodate you.  Staff throughout the hotel are cheerful and professional.  Speak up!—if you have special needs or expectations.  You will be given not traditional keys but key cards, which will also function to give you access to, for instance, the excellent fitness center, which, though compact, is well-furnished with up-to-date weight machines addressing all the major muscle groups, has a flat bench and dumbbells, and aerobic machines, is private for guests, and is kept spotlessly clean.

I always dine at the hotel’s restaurant Public Kitchen and Bar, which, in an easygoing atmosphere, combines the finest food with the finest service.  As throughout the hotel, part of the fun at the restaurant is in observing the other patrons—everything from Hollywood types to foreign businessmen to tourists from the Midwest.  (Public Kitchen is closed to dining Sunday nights, if that makes a difference to you; but there are plenty of restaurants in the general area.)  If you eat breakfast at the hotel, you will have it at the casual 25° at the front of the hotel, open 24 hours for light meals (breakfast, burgers, etc.), with good food and ever-friendly and hip staff.

I am a repeat patron of the Hollywood Roosevelt.  I have a great deal of affection for it and the overall personality of the hotel and its clientele.  It’s unique!  Be a good guest, play your part, tap into the Hollywood dynamic with an attitude of discovery and creativity, resilience and camaraderie, respect for the beautiful traditional hotel building; and the wonderful experience you’ll have will always make you think of the Hollywood Roosevelt with pleasure and appreciation for the fantastic, distinctive, and rewarding time you had.  You deserve this gift to yourself!",,4.0,5.0,,,,5.0,Bre S,Guest Relations Manager,2017-10-27,"Brent D,

BR1,2789,"Rimini, Italy",2017-04-30,COUPLES,2017-06-21,3,Nothing to rave about..,"As I've already visited the Roosevelt’s pool during other trips to LA, this time I wanted to try the hotel itself.
Booked several weeks in advance my three-nights stay and was pretty excited about that because of all the good things I’ve heard about it, even if I’m not a fan of the Hollywood location.
Made my reservation through the Preferred Hotels & Resorts website but at the check-in I wasn't recognized as an iPrefer member so wasn't given a password for the free wifi (had to ask later for it) and had no complimentary upgrade as advertised. I’ve told this when I’ve been asked by email from the hotel’s Director of Guest Relations if everything was ok with my stay, but got no answer. 
As you may know, this is an historic building located in the heart of Hollywood, which may be a good or a not-so-good thing. I usually like to stay in other neighborhoods when in LA as I find this part of the city to be particularly shabby and overly touristy. The Roosevelt went through some major renovation works recently and I must say that the renovated rooms are very nicely appointed even if the Queen Bed rooms are super, super tiny. Fun fact: our closet was almost as big as the bathroom. That means that we could store all of our luggage in it, but on the other side the lack of space in the bathroom was evident.   
Given the tiny size of the room I also found annoying the amount of merchandising everywhere, from flip flops to tees to caps, etc. I understand the will of selling the hotel merchandise but you can't fill a small room with items to sell: I need space for my own things when traveling!
The pool was nice as I remembered and it’s always a pleasure to spend some time there, even if a couple of guys working there are so full of themselves and looked more interested in talking with their friends instead of taking care of the guests. We also visited the Library Bar one night (with high expectations) and while the guy working there was super nice and prepared, the bar itself was not provided with all the ingredients for preparing a Vieux Carré cocktail. No big deal of course, but weird for what it’s supposed to be one of the best bars in town.
Would I come back to The Roosevelt? Probably not. Maybe I’ll just keep going to their lovely pool, but in terms of hospitality, location, rooms and service.. well, there are better hotels in Los Angeles.",,,,,,,,Bryce R,Guest Relations,2017-12-03,"Hello interpol81,

Thank you for writing us this review and giving us your honest feedback. I am sorry to hear about the frustrations that you had during your stay with us. Unfortunately, the upgrades advertised through iPrefer are based on availability, so that would usually be the reason why an upgrade was not made available to you. I will pass your comments along to management to make sure that we take the proper steps to ensure quality service for all of our guests. I would love to turn this experience/memory around for you, so if you ever find yourself traveling our way please reach out to me directly and I will make sure that we take great care of you!

rooster3888,57,"Louisville, Kentucky",2017-06-30,SOLO,2017-06-15,4,Interesting historic hotel,"I stayed at the Hollywood Roosevelt for one night in June of 2017. This historic hotel is located right in Hollywood across from the Chinese Theater amongst other landmarks and on the Walk of Fame (albeit, the Walk of Fame goes in for many blocks). The hotel is definitely a throwback. The hallways and rooms have a sort of 1950’s cruise ship type of feel (not that I’ve been on a 1950’s cruise ship, but I’d imagine it would be similar). The rooms are small as is typical in historic hotels. I have no idea how they compare to other hotels in the Hollywood or Los Angeles area, though. The lobby and bar area is particularly beautiful, with Spanish-style architecture throughout. Everything is rather dark inside, though. I enjoyed having a drink at the bar. I also tried the onsite burger joint for a burger and a spiked milkshake, both of which were good. Check-in was smooth and the person who checked me in was very friendly and helpful. I wanted to stop by the pool as I was walking around the hotel, but was stopped by a guy who looked at me suspiciously, asked what I was doing, and then told me only guests were allowed at the pool. I told him I was a guest and then he just said, “well, we don’t allow outside food or drink in anyway” (I had a coffee in my hand). Okay, whatever. Good that they have someone ensuring the pool is reserved for guests (I also noticed the hotel has security by its doors), but the interaction was weird. 

Overall the Roosevelt was a neat place to stay for a night. It does a nice job of maintaining the “old school” Hollywood feel which is an experience unto itself. I probably wouldn’t stay again only because I don’t see myself coming back to Hollywood (was interesting to see once, but that’s it) and the hotel vibe isn’t really my thing, but I did enjoy the one night I was there.",,,4.0,,4.0,4.0,,Bre S,Guest Relations Manager,2017-11-19,"rooster3888,

Thank you for staying with us, even if it was just one night. We are indeed a throwback, 90 years this year.

We are working very hard to protect the pool area for our hotel guest only. We will share your feedback and use it for a training tool, thank you.

I would not recommend this hotel loads of better ones in LA and in much better locations, Hollywood boulevard is noisy, run down and frankly dangerous at night.

Kevin B,26,,2017-06-30,COUPLES,2017-06-13,5,"Great Hotel, steeped in history","Our first time in LA, so I thought I'd book a hotel in the centre of Hollywood to aid sight seeing. Good decision to get next to the sights, situated right on the walk of fame and close to a Hard rock, the TCL Chinese Theatre, Madame Tussauds, Dolby Theatre etc.

We were on our honeymoon so the hotel desk upgraded us to a Cabana Suite - wow, what an incredible room over looking the pool area and opposite the Marilyn suite.  The hotel is steeped in History and you get a real feel for the old Hollywood as you walk around the hotel.  The hotel team were great, friendly and extremely helpful. The hotel is a 15 minute taxi away from Universal studios, which we also visited within our stay in LA.  Beverley Hills is also not far away and we enjoyed a few days of fine dining, premium shopping and sight seeing down there.

My only negative of the hotel, which isn't really the hotel's fault is that is situated on Hollywood Boulevard which is a little run down in areas (although reportedly trying to get it's act together).  The walk ways have quite a few homeless, and people trying to sell you anything from a sight seeing trip to a CD to a picture with Chewbacca.  On an evening you don't feel totally safe walking in areas of the street, although once back in the hotel the environment is again perfect. 

An incredible hotel which I would love to stay at again, the room and the team were fantastic and I would imagine the Hollywood area would find it difficult to top the environment and service here.  However I would probably say paying that kind of money you'd probably enjoy staying in Beverley Hills more and it would only take 4-6 hours to see what that part of Hollywood offers, but if you don't mind the Boulevard I would absolutely not stay anywhere else.",,,5.0,,5.0,5.0,,Bre S,Guest Relations Manager,2017-12-02,"Kevin B,

The location is right on the Hollywood blvd and you can't get more central than this hotel. The staff were all very friendly and attentive. 

The negatives: way too expensive to park for the valet charges. As mentioned it was memorial weekend Sunday when we stayed having flown in from the UK. We had to ring down twice to security to complain about the noise coming from across the corridor the last time being around 3am. The smell of cannabis on our floor was overwhelming.

tonymerricks,37,"Melbourne, Australia",2017-06-30,BUSINESS,2017-06-08,1,Oh dear. Not good. ,"You can have interesting decor, a cool restaurant, a modern aesthetic and switched-on staff.

But if you don't effectively warn prospective guests - who book on your website earlier on the day of their stay -that the LA authorities will be cutting power and water to the building from 2am to 5am, meaning that:

- your cool 24 hour  restaurant will be closed; 
- you will offer no room service;
- there will be no water and power in their rooms;

you are treading on shaky ground. So here is my review:

Are you kidding me? Do you think your guests are fools? Do you think this behaviour is even remotely acceptable (at $500+ per room per night?) 

No one cares about the rest. You are unreliable and, let's say it, not to be trusted. 

",,,,,,,,Sebastian K,Front Office Manager,2017-10-21,"tonymerricks,

Thank you for the initial kind words we are proud of what we have created here; but clearly misstepped on the communication with you. Unfortunately, this was an unprecedented situation, cause by emergency work performed by the city, that we as a hotel have to learn from. We do take how we handle situations like this to hear and I want to assure you we will improve upon our communication should we have to go through this once again.

GryJungberg,49,"Aalborg, Denmark",2017-05-31,FAMILY,2017-06-06,3,Kind staff but too much pool partying.,"The hotel has a great location just opposite the chinese theater in the center of Hollywood. The staff was nice  and checking in and out of the hotel went very smooth. We had chosen this hotel mainly because of its location, but also because of the heated pool and the fitness facilities. As I am from Europe I wasn´t aware that we were travelling over memorial weekend and apparently the hotel hosted 3 pool parties during that weekend, which was during our stay. We were not notified about that when we made our booking - which was several weeks before we were planning to arrive. If they had told me that I probably would have chosen another hotel. There was so much partying ging on that we couldn´t use the pool those 3 days. Also people were staying up all night, and we had 3 young guys living opposite of us defininately smoking weed and some other young guys harassed us in the elevator. i was travelling with two girls aged 11 and fourteen. The gym wasn´t very good either - but I had it to myself most mornings which almost made up for the facilities. For those reasons I probably would not choose that hotel next time I go to Los Angeles.",,,3.0,4.0,,3.0,,Sebastian K,Front Office Manager,2017-10-21,"GryJungberg,

In addition we just recently modernized all the gym equipment!

Luxury period of 1920s designed in Spanish / Moroccan style of ground floor double high ceiling and tiled floors. Furniture is mainly leather. A pleasure to get away from the modern luxury.  

The rooms are wooden floors covered in large rugs. Beautiful wooden sliding doors between the lounge and bedroom with cast iron sliders. All rooms that I can see have views.

Kim J,46,,2017-04-30,FRIENDS,2017-06-06,5,Hooray for Hollywood,"Stayed at the Hollywood Roosevelt - first impressions from the airport to the hotel via taxi of Hollywood Boulevard was ""what a dump this street is"".  Checked into the hotel, and the room was a bit of a shock from our first leg of this trip in Vegas.  However, we soon warmed into it.  Not much a view from the room but a small view of the pool area.  All the staff were beyond helpful - from the guys on the door to Bryce on customer services and the check in staff.  Loved all the history of this hotel, and the location of it is very good - despite a bit further up the road looking a bit derelict!  The rooms had a very European style feel to them but many of the public areas retained their nod to the past.  We asked for a kettle for the room and one arrived with no issue, although on the ground floor outside the lift is free tea/coffee etc but if you don't want the rive of going to get it then a kettle in the room is great.  Large walk in wardrobe but a very small (and I mean very small) bathroom.  One small wash basin but a decent size shower.  Loved all the old black and white photographs in the lobby areas of each floor when coming out the lift with their little vignettes of background stories.  It is in a great location for the underground/shopping/Chinese Theatre/Hollywood Museum.  We dined in one of the restaurants on an evening and also had a breakfast there.  Managed a half day around the pool area, which is fabulous.  Great music playing - super comfortable loungers and a great vibe - almost felt like I was at someone's private party.  Great hotel and loved the history associated with it. Well done to them for retaining that era of sophistication and chic.",,5.0,5.0,,,4.0,,Bre S,Director of Guest Relations,2017-07-26,"Hi Kim J,

We were located near the pool and had a patio and access to a fire pit.  The mini bar was truly a thing of beauty!  I love a good mini bar and this one was super.

This was the perfect stay for me, and the great service started even before I arrived. I sent an email to one of the Directors, Lara hoping for an answer before getting there (a challenge in other hotels), got an answer promptly and a positive one too on my request. That became many after that all of which were completed before I got to the hotel which made my arrival stress free. This lady is on 24/7 I can tell you and it seems to be a hotel policy as along my stay I got in touch with Juliana, Sebastian and finally Bre. all of which went out of their way to help! 
We come to the hotel itself, although one of the oldest, the rooms and hallways are very well kept, very clean and I was honestly surprised by the cleanliness of the lobby, which is open to public and frequently visited by tourists who do not stay at the hotel.
No sound pollution too as the rooms seem to be isolated from the street noise (although right on walk of fame).
I only got the chance to use the pool as amenities and although small it is the setting that is captivating.
You will definitely run into celebrities there as film shooting is common in the hotel.
I also tried the 25 degrees restaurant that operated 24 hours and it is all that you need while staying at the hotel.

Kaden G,23,"Stillwater, Minnesota",2017-05-31,BUSINESS,2017-05-20,5,"Classic, nostalgic property in the heart of Hollywood that's worth the cost","I had always wanted to stay at the Roosevelt after learning of its storied history and place as one of the most iconic hotels in the US, with a guest list to the likes of Fitzgerald and Prince. After checking in, I could see why they stayed.

The hotel's distinct architecture, variations in lighting for different spaces, and subdued, yet classic rooms make the Roosevelt a standout in the hotel game, especially in a city like LA, where there are tons of options. Although the signature ""Hotel Roosevelt"" sign distinguishes the property, once on it, there is complete privacy. The hotel grounds are encased by hedges on Orange St as you enter the carport.

The pool and Tropicana Bar/Cafe are some of my favorite spots on the property. Palm trees and the secluded cabana rooms surround the pool, with ample seating around it for maximum comfort. I spent a Tuesday afternoon there after a job interview and was not disappointed. 

I was able to secure a rate of about $200 on Hotel Tonight, definitely a cheaper rate for this caliber of property, which justified my ordering the Little Gem Caesar Salad, a delicious menu option, as well as a few poolside drinks. This is the place to spend money and not feel guilty about it, as the experience and service are truly memorable. In addition, if you can swing it, request a late check out to feel less rushed and to give you more time to appreciate the hotel.

Because I stayed here during the beginning of the week, I did not encounter any loudness, but if you stay here later in the week, I would suggest getting a room on a higher floor to avoid some of the noise that might be present with private events.",Ask for a room facing the Hollywood sign and downtown LA for the best of both worlds,,4.0,,5.0,5.0,,Bre S,Director of Guest Relations,2017-05-30,"Kaden G,

Everything is overpriced on Hollywood Blvd and the Roosevelt is no different.  Some of the staff is extremely pleasant and helpful and some, not so much.  My room was on the 8th floor and was a great size.  I am admittedly one of those travelers that is never satisfied with the cleanliness of a hotel room so I do not complain but comparatively speaking, this was average on my cleanliness scale.   The pool was very nice with parties every Sunday.  The scene was a bit young wanna-be's for my liking or maybe I am simply too mature/old for that scene.  The hotel food was overpriced but to be fair, most hotels are.  Overall, it was a good stay, comfy bed, large room, and plenty of local options for food, clothing, shoes, CVS if you are a business traveler and need access to such things.",tower rooms are quieter but the elevators take forever; choose the room with the larger sq. footage,,3.0,,,4.0,3.0,Bre S,Director of Guest Relations,2017-06-06,"gots_2_travel,

vegashag,14,"Denver, Colorado",2017-04-30,FRIENDS,2017-05-17,2,Waste of money,"This hotel was on my bucket list of iconic places to stay.  To say we were disappointed is an understatement.  The room was large and comfortable, but the television was parallel to the beds, so watching from bed was next to impossible.  There are no vending machines so if you want a beverage you have only three options and they're all expensive:  one of the bars/restaurants, room service, or the mini-bar in the room.  The service in the bar was poor, the food was nothing special, and the prices for the mini-bar were outrageous.  $11 for a bottle of water?  $5 for a small bottle of Diet Coke (there was only one in the fridge).  Ridiculous.  Considering the history of this hotel, we expected some ambience that tied in with that, as well as some information regarding the big Hollywood stars who stayed there in the past (and may still be around, according to haunted sources!).  The hotel is really missing out by not offering some type of ghostly cocktail hour where these legends and tales are shared by staff.  Big disappointment.",,,3.0,3.0,4.0,,,,Manager,2017-05-25,"Appreciate you sharing your experience with me. The ""ghostly cocktail hour"" sounds like a great idea!

The area is very touristy, and it's great that there are built in filtering processes to keep the masses away. We were here for an event and it was fantastic to not have to leave the property once we were done at the event. 

We had shrimp tacos by the pool for lunch and they were delicious, staff friendly and attentive.

Tip: If your going to stay here, book directly with  them and you'll get the best price with upgrade options if available. We got an upgrade to pool side or pool view room and we took the view room, little more private that way. 

Private party was fantastic, ate and drank to our hearts content since we didn't have to go any where afterwards.

Got access to the private bar as well, and was cool to bowl in a hidden place. Oops, maybe I wasn't suppose to mention that!

Consuela H,14,,2017-05-31,COUPLES,2017-05-14,1,Will not be staying again. ,"We arranged a romantic 6 days in one of the more expensive cabana rooms at the Hotel Roosevelt. Our experience could not be further from what we'd hoped for. 

The room condition is precarious. For a couples room, there was only one of everything. The sink was broken, we only had one robe, and only one chair in the terrace. When we called to complain, they brought up one chair (which seemingly belonged to a conference room). The bed gets made everyday, but the room does not look like it gets cleaned. 

We suffered through parties until 2am directly adjacent to rooms, and drunk people in the corridors once they were over. On the third day we were offered a room change- but we were only offered a change to a smaller & cheaper room (which we naturally did not take). 

Be prepared to walk through clouds of marihuana and a chance to purchase hard drugs by the poolside. 

The swimming pool has completely arbitrary rules which seem to change at the hotels discretion. Service is poor, and the pool hosts are extremely rude and unhelpful. We were unable to get a place by the pool until our last day, with no help from the staff. Probably the worst service we've ever experienced. 

Would not recommend, and certainly not worth the money.

We stayed in a Queen room which was very small but cozy. The bed was incredibly comfortable and the pillows...let's just say I wish I could have taken them home! The room also had windows which can be opened which is quite rare. Bathroom was clean but also small.

There were a few things we weren't overly happy with... no full length mirror in the room we stayed in...I had to keep using the mirrors in the lift and the lighting in there was really dim so not the best mirror to use. We had a lot of issues with our aircon/heating. It was very noisy and we were unable to ever get the temperature right even after having the handyman come up to check it out. The hotel also has quite a few homeless people who hang around out the front. This was a bit confronting and unpleasant when trying to pop out to get breakfast etc. 

If I was to visit LA again I would probably be more inclined to stay in West Hollywood as I really found Hollywood Boulevard a bit overrated.

Beautiful pool area, but the crowd out there is about half my age, so I didn't hang out. Bartender inside was nice while I waited for my room.

A couple of complaints: Like any older hotel, the bathrooms were small and there is no where to spread out your bathroom stuff. The hotel was pretty tight with the towels (two towels for two people). I'd recommend asking for more towels. About an hour after I checked in, some employees came in and switched out the room service snacks. I thought that was very strange.

It is a very old hotel, although has been refurbished after someone else ruined the place.  It is a sort of Spanish Colonial style I think, with some Art Deco thrown in.  We were put in a suite next to a double, so we could accommodate our family.  We did have a struggle to get them to make up a spare bed for us and had to ask several times.  However, we had an enjoyable stay.

The rooms are really noisy - we were on the 10th floor, and could clearly hear what was going on in the parking lot and the room next door. Only 2 elevators in the building - one night they closed one for a wedding, and another day one was broken, and it was a major hassle. Location is in the middle of Hollywood - the equivalent of staying in Times Square in NYC. Lots of stuff within walking distance or a short Uber ride. Burger place at the hotel is pretty good. The hotel pool (which apparently is famous) is a total outdoor booze scene - my 16 year old refused to go, in part because the entire pool area smelled like pot. The WiFi is not free, and the service is terrible. I paid for it and then never used it b/c it was so slow.

It is supposed to house Marilyn Monroe's ghost, so it has a lot of history.  There is a ton of traffic all around if you are driving.  Parking is more than $30 per night.

johninsd,5,,2017-03-31,BUSINESS,2017-04-25,5,Boutique Luxury + Historical Charm,"I have stayed at The Hollywood Roosevelt twice in the past year. During this most recent visit, I was impressed that my experience was exactly the same as the previous: absolutely fantastic. When I arrived at The Hollywood Roosevelt, the bell service and front desk made me feel like I had just arrived home. They asked how I was doing, asked if there was anything they could do to make my experience more enjoyable, and even made me laugh on several occasions. Simultaneously, I could feel the rich Hollywood history of Marilyn Monroe, Charlie Chaplain and Clark Gamble coursing the walls and ambiance. 

I had the pleasure of staying in a King Studio for both visits. The layout and furnishings were delightful and comfortable. The room was quiet, despite looking down (with iconic views) of a city that never rests, only being able to hear the light whisper of the air conditioner. The large desk and fast Internet allowed me to get my work done while enjoying a beautiful spread of food and coffee from room service. 

A few days after I departed, I received a survey via email from the property's management. I filled it out with the expectation that it was 'automated' and would be overlooked, but felt compelled to do so regardless due to the exceptional level of service I received during my stay. To my surprise and delight, I received a personal email response from the Guest Relations Manager, Juliana Perez, acknowledging my feedback and making me feel truly valued.

Samantha  B,12,"Dearborn, Michigan",2017-03-31,FRIENDS,2017-04-21,2,If you are planning the weekend here!,"The Roosevelt was #1 on my list of hotels for several years I have seen the ups & downs of this beautiful hotel! Location is great as I have friends and family on both the east and west side of town. The last few years I have been staying at the Sunset Marques because of work and it is a great place to stay and relax.  This trip was all about seeing friends & family so I thought why not stay at the Roosevelt. 

If you are planning on relaxing, traveling with children and choosing this hotel for the beautiful pool do not book the Cabana Suites!! Especially if it is the weekend. 
I am used to party’s going on at the pool so I thought no big deal I wont be using it that much and I chose the Cabana Suite which is pricey but the photos made it look worth it. It is a fully functioning party room. And that is about it. You cannot turn up the lights and here is the reason why they have the LARGEST BUGS! You’re by the pool and there is a café so I get it. What I don’t get is having to tell the front desk 5 times if someone could please come and remove and clean him out of my room! The manager was very friendly and said that they would have it taken care of right away. This bug that was about the size of my hand stayed in the room longer then I did.

Finally at the end of the day and after my 4th call to the front desk I walked down past the velvet ropes, drunken people loud music and a guy getting sick in a corner and let him know he was still there. The manager comps 2 nights of parking. It was Saturday and I thought the pool party should be over soon and I can relax, I had no idea a whole new party was about to start!! Needless to say I did not sleep very well between the loud music and covering my head so not to have a bug crawl over me. The very next day I spent with friends and family so really didn’t want to go back to my room. I was booked until Tuesday pool party’s were over and thought I would enjoy the rest of my trip. Behold another LARGE BUG! Was able to get him out of room and immediately changed flight and decided to leave a day early as there was no way I would sleep. When asked how was my stay and why I was checking out early I let the girl at the front desk know and again she said I will comp parking.  

If you are there to party it is the place for you! If you are there for relaxation then please book somewhere else!

A R M,318,"Brooklyn, New York",2017-04-30,FRIENDS,2017-04-19,4,Tried the Cabana & Tower rooms,"I spent 3 nights at the Hollywood Roosevelt hotel this past week. Was in town to see some friends and celebrate a big moment in two friend's lives. The location was great as I needed to get between Santa Monica & Hollywood. 

Check-in was fast & easy. My initial room was in the Cabana section with a patio for lounging. The rooms are comfortable but not large. Their close proximity to the pool is great during the day. At night it's good for the partier crowds. The ambient noise of people & music weren't disturbing to me but ear plugs would be advised for lighter sleepers. 

To help adjust to my jet lag I requested to move to a different room for my last two nights. I was given a corner room in the Tower section. The room was much bigger and more comfortable. The downside to this room was that the TV used an IP system which reset often. More of an annoyance than a problem. 

Staff are friendly and attentive. The hotel has a 24 hour gym to help burn off the drinks from the night before. It has all the equipment you'd expect of a good hotel gym. 

The Roosevelt pool is a party place. The hotel has a few others bars too and a burger spot. The hotel is also not for those on a budget. The wifi costs are higher than most other hotel's premium wifi packages. The minibar is also a bit above other hotel prices. If you want to save you can walk across the street to the CVS that has a rather decent selection of liquors, wines, beers & snacks.",Tower room for size &amp; quiet.

The pool and decor of the whole hotel was superb. 
The only negative was the TCM convention was on and we were not allowed in many areas including the lobby and pool on occasions. 
Apart from this I would have given a 5 star.",,,,,,,,Bre S,Director of Guest Relations,2017-04-25,"Thank you for taking the time to share this review with us.

E F,10,"New York City, New York",2017-04-30,FAMILY,2017-04-14,3,Needs a refresh or at least some maintenance,"The hotel appears like a friend who has just let themselves go, may have been beautiful at some point, but just stopped taking care of itself.  Well the staff is very friendly, and performs as well as they should for a nice hotel, there are certain parts of the hotel that are not well-kept.  

The elevators should never be a neglected part of any building. Building owners should take pride in their elevators, as they are one of the things in a building that can kill people.  The elevators bounce. That is reflective of poor maintenance, not age.   I live in a building much older than the hotel, and spend my days in and out of buildings just as old. Bouncing elevators are dangerous, not cute, not because the building is haunted, and not rustic.  The brass panels in the elevator are disgraceful. Buy some brass polish, clean it up.  The brass call buttons on each floor are riddled with fingerprints and oxidation.

The rooms overlooking Hollywood Boulevard are noisy, not because they overlook a noisy street, but because the windows are cheap and not maintained.  None of the windows in our room locked into place, leaving large gaps where noise comes through.",,,,,,,,Briane S,Guest Relations Manager,2017-11-22,"E F,

Oh no, we can't let ourselves go! We just turned 90 and clearly need to make some changes to stay fabulous in the city of Stars! We are going to start our elevator project in 2018 - being historic and all, we have to look at many things when changing things. Hoewever, your feedback is very valueable to us.

We Wandered West,26,"Big Bear Lake, California",2016-06-30,FRIENDS,2017-04-09,4,Historical Hollywood Hotel,"I have stayed at The Roosevelt several times.  I have had many very fun Hollywood nights at this hotel. The rooms are nice. There's nothing very special or mentionable about their standard rooms. The upgraded suites are obviously much nicer. I like their poolside suites but be prepared to pay a pretty penny for those. However they don't feel very private since you're right on the pool so you'll have pool goers right out front of your room. I don't stay at this hotel for the rooms, I stay here for the overall experience. The Roosevelt Hotel is an experience. When I'm staying at any hotel, I want an experience. The Roosevelt Hotel definitely delivers an experience and I have always loved my stays here.  The lobby is beautiful and full of that classic Hollywood glamour and vibe.  If you've never stayed here I recommend you experience all this historical hotel has to offer.

Shaunx10,115,"Manchester, United Kingdom",2017-03-31,FRIENDS,2017-03-30,4,a taste of Hollywood,"So I have been coming here for years and between the hotel, the Pool and the bars.
I've averaged it 4*
The building alone btw is very impressive - even been upstairs a few times to the private bar where you can play indoor bowls (I sucked) ($100 per lane) - great for couples and small groups - I advise booking for this as a security on the door.

This last visit was for lunch at the POOL....
great ambiance - although I did prefer when the tables were scattered around randomly rather than all being squashed into the back area.

I brought friends from Denmark and they loved it - although too hot even for March for them - but PERFECT for a bit of Sun worshiping. 

a great layout with bed and double beds around the pool - ideal for couples and pairs of friends. you can even have food on the tables next to your beds - so very well organised.

for those out to see stars - never seen any, but plenty of 'Beautiful People'.

this time the food was disappointing though - kale Salad - asked for warm NOT cold chicken - got gold chicken - felt like straight out of the fridge. they apologised (as I'd expressly said 'Warm, NOT cold chicken) - but then took another 30 mins to get my food back, then the chicken came but felt like it had been dry oven baked - just dry and really chewy and since no sauce in the kale salad - just was dry and bland.
Felt like they simply didn't know how to do chicken creatively beyond heating it.
shame - hopefully next time or a bit of off duty chef training.

C22,19,"London, United Kingdom",2017-03-31,FRIENDS,2017-03-27,2,Great location but otherwise very disappointing,"The location of this hotel is excellent - very central and near a Metro stop. Other than that, I thought it was extremely overrated and overpriced. The historic lobby is quite impressive (albeit very dark) and the brasserie/restaurant was ok, but the standard (superior!) rooms are badly designed and tiny. I appreciate that it's an old hotel, but they're way too small for two people, have no drawer space and very limited hanging space in the wardrobe. In addition to that, one of the lamps in our room wasn't working, the sink and bath didn't drain properly, and the air conditioning was extremely noisy, none of which is what I would expect of a hotel of this class. There's also very little soundproofing in the rooms so you can hear everything that happens in the corridor. The staff at reception and the bell hops weren't particularly friendly or helpful - it was quite challenging to get someone to take our luggage to the store and then to find someone to get it back. I got the impression that everyone's main focus is the people at the hotel for private parties/TV events and to use the bars rather than the actual guests. Wouldn't recommend staying here unless you have absolutely no other options.",Avoid the standard (superior) rooms at all costs!,,2.0,,,1.0,3.0,Sebastian K,Front Office Manager,2017-05-03,"Dear C22,

Suzie M,16,"Long Beach, California",2017-03-31,FAMILY,2017-03-27,5,Luxury Fun,"Los Angeles hotels never seem to be cheap but the Roosevelt is high class fun.

1. Location - excellent placement in the heart of Hollywood. Across the street from Graumann's theater.
2. Rooms - spacious, beautiful decor (fresh and welcoming). Great beds.
3. Staff - very welcoming, aim to please.
4. Amenities - lots of bars and restaurants - including a beautiful pool area for lounging.

Small quibbles
 - parking is expensive (42 dollars for on site parking). There is a parking structure across the street but not sure if that was 24 hours.
- wifi in rooms is not free. (If you are a non-US based traveller reliant on Wi-fi this might be annoying. I think they have free access in certain areas or you could go to starbucks across the road.)

simonjam89,2,"Falkirk, United Kingdom",2016-09-30,FRIENDS,2017-03-24,5,No complaints - tropical paradise in LA,"Stayed for 4 nights with 3 other guests in 2 Cabana rooms.

Truly enjoyed my stay here, moreso than any other hotel in our US trip. We stayed in the pool view Cabana rooms, which had massive beds (wide enough that they aren't awkward sleeping next to a non-partner) and amazing overhead showers. Pool view was very relaxing to sit out on the balcony in the mornings too. Would recommend these rooms and would want to stay in them again. It does get noisy until 1-2am some nights so I wouldn't recommend them to people who want peace but we were 4 guys in our twenties so it didn't bother us. 

Sitting by the pool is quiet until around lunchtime, so if you're an early riser its good to head down and grab a lounger and a free coffee from the restaurant while you wait. It's truly amazing how much this place feels like a sanctuary on the busy and tacky Hollywood strip. Even during the busier afternoons the hostess's would happily come over and talk to you and get you towels/drinks etc. It was fun sitting by the bar and discussing our trip with them as well. 

Good location to get picked up by Ubers on the road behind the car park. Ubers were less than $10 to get to CBS studios and the Observatory. 

Other than trouble finding the check-in desk when we arrived (through the doors on the strip) I honestly have no complaints. Felt like a fun luxury hotel. I will 100% be staying here again if I visit LA again.",Cabana rooms seem bigger so may be worth getting one on the street facing side if you don&#39;t want noise.,,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,Bre S,Director of Guest Relations,2017-04-01,"Simonjam89,

The Roosevelt is a beautiful property right in the middle of things. It also has a great swimming pool which the kids enjoyed. 

25 degrees is a first class burger joint that is part of the hotel and The Public Kitchen and Bar a brilliant restaurant. 

This is a more adult orientated hotel but our kids enjoyed it. The pool parties on the weekend can be a little ""adult"" with loud DJ-music (which we enjoyed) and plenty of poolside smoking. If you can get your head round this (we did!) there is no reason not to take kids to the pool. The music became very loud in the evening, so if you are staying for a weekend with the family, request a room on a higher floor.

Our room had a balcony overlooking the pool and Tropicana Bar. Obviously in warmer weather it would be noisy- but the room seemed rather sound proof once the door was shut. Will try the tower next time, just for something different- but loved our room just the same.

First impressions were it didn't seem like a usual hotel but from the moment we chatted with the staff it went up in our estimation.  The room was elegantly decorated and comfortable and clean with a lovely four poster bed.  We had a view of the fabulous roof top pool.  Nothing was too much trouble for the warm and friendly reception team. One girl Sophia was like a friend by the end of our stay.  She helped us with so many things including setting up Uber on our smart phones.  She also helped with our itinerary of what to see in L.A suggesting the brilliant Warner Bros studio tour and also helped with directions for our forthcoming road trip to San Francisco.  The lovely concierge team were also great especially Mike with sorting out our hire car.   Literally nothing was too much trouble for these wonderful staff.  The hotel grew on us more and more each day with its rich history and the location couldn't be better.  It is also much better value than many other hotels of its calibre. I would definitely recommend staying at the Hotel Hollywood Roosevelt as we will use it again when we revisit L.A.,,,,,,,,Bre S,Guest Relations Manager,2017-03-21,"RosGrass,

The hotel is beautiful and you can tell they pay attention to the details. I loved the old Hollywood glamour feel to the hotel combined with the modern amenities in the rooms. The hotel staff is also wonderful and very friendly. 

We stayed in one of the rooms by the pool, so would suggest not staying there if you prefer a quieter room. They were setting up for an Oscars event that night/early morning, and you could hear them clearly from the room. The pool bars were closed for the weekend because of the Oscars, but I'm guessing it would be even louder if the pool bars were open. 

Overall it was a wonderful hotel and we want to stay here again the next time we're in LA! ",,,,,,,,Bre S,Guest Relations Manager,2017-03-21,"MaryYM84,

Our room was small (tho I'm sure you can spring for a bigger one), but totally satisfactory. Nice and comfortable.  A real treat is the pool area. We spent most of our last day living the cabana lifestyle, except we didn't have to pay for one of cabanas, which look really cool. Great service.

We booked a room for 3 adults but as this room had 2 double beds we asked for a trundle bed. This was done with no problems. Room was a nice size but I must admit the trundle bed wasn't the most comfortable. The next day they move my husband and I to an other room and my daughter they gave her a room to herself for the remaining 2 nights. Loved the tiles on the bathroom floor, which is a good size. I found the rooms quite. It was so good to be able to walk around the area. Staff on the front entrance and check in are very helpful with wide grins every time we saw them.

The hotel is well maintained although the decor is a bit dated. Our room had a great view of downtown LA but the room lacked storage room  to unpack luggage and the bathroom had to be the smallest we have ever seen (and we have seen many). The other issue was controlling the temperature in the room. The in room thermostat did not respond. The staff were all friendly and helpful and we ate two nights in the hotel as there are not a lot of choice in the immediate area. We were pleased with the quality of food and service in both restaurants. The pool area is pleasant and a bit of an oasis in the urban area.

Gorgeous tile, arched doorways, vaulted ceilings, etc.  Really can't say enough.  A number of things really marred the stay though.  One is that the windows were frosted over, so no views of Hollywood, and you really feel boxed in.  Worse than that, the NOISE from the club one floor below literally made our pillows vibrate.

Louise M,30,,2017-03-31,FAMILY,2017-03-04,4,Hollywood visir,"This hotel has so much charm and charisma. I was excited to stay here and in many respects I wasn't disappointed. Our room was large, on the 11th floor with window views of the Hollywood sign.  The beds were large and super comfortable. The bathroom was huge.  We received complimentary wifi (thank you!).  The staff were friendly and welcoming. 

The pool area was great! I loved the sun loungers and the music. The downside... there were quite a few heavily intoxicated guests by the pool. Lots of smoking! If you hate cigarette smoke in public pool areas (I do!) then you may not like this area.  The food and drink for purchase was overpriced which is pretty standard hotel I guess, but there are plenty of options for food nearby.  I was overcharged by the pool for food/drinks but by the time I noticed (it was already charged to my credit card) it wasn't a huge amount so I didn't want to make a fuss so please check your bill carefully.  

I would definitely stay here again! I loved the beauty, and history of this building.  One of my favourite hotels! ",,,,,,,,Bre S,Director of Guest Relations,2017-05-03,"Louise M,

Check in was excellent, we were travelling to LA  to celebrate a birthday and wedding anniversary and on arrival the hotel upgraded us to a junior suite with the best view of the the Boulevard. We arrived at night so it was a spectacular sight to see the bright lights of Hollywood from our window. We also had a bottle of champagne on ice and birthday cakes in our room waiting for us. When we woke the next morning the view from our room was even more special as we could see the Hollywood sign one way and the city the other. The room was beautiful (room 1109), the only negative being a very small bathroom. The hotel was spotlessly clean and all the staff were super friendly and helpful, nothing was too much trouble.

We arrived after midnight, tired and miserable after our previous experience. The gentleman on reception, Forrest, was amazing and did everything he could to help get us in a room quickly despite some confusion over the booking (our previous hotel had only booked us one night rather than two) There was a pool party going on that night and so Forrest put us in a quiet room in the tower so we could rest then very kindly said we could transfer to a pool cabana room the following day. This all happened seamlessly and after spending the following day looking around LA we came back to find all our luggage moved to the most beautiful room overlooking the pool. We were unlucky to find ourselves in LA during a very rainy couple of days which meant we didn't get a chance to use the pool or spend an evening at the pool bar, but all the same the room was sensational and the overall experience was fantastic. 
I can't recommend this place highly enough, from the staff to the rooms, the great cocktails in the bar and the excellent location, you really can't beat it.

JeremyPF,123,"Lancaster, Pennsylvania",2017-02-28,COUPLES,2017-02-22,3,"A Cool Hotel, But Very Noisy - Especially At Night","Great spot if you want to stroll down Hollywood Boulevard as the rear of the hotel is pretty much opposite the Chinese Theatre, Walk of Fame etc.  

We booked a Cabana Room on the second floor, which is directly overlooking the pool area and Tropicana Bar. Apparently, both the pool and bar are very popular. Our long weekend here was during the heavy rains, so the pool wasn't open on two of the days but the last day the pool and bar were packed with people. The loud music made it up to our room, so be warned -  if you plan on having an early night it's impossible to sleep with the music going. Also, the walls of the rooms are quite thin and we could easily hear the adjoining guests. There is nowhere to charge your laptop (except maybe the floor or bathroom) and the desk is really tiny. On the plus side, the rooms are clean, nicely designed and we enjoyed the large space, comfortable bed and modern bathroom with shampoo, conditioner, soap and body lotion. It would have been nice to have more bath-size towels (only one per person was provided).
We tried both restaurants Public Kitchen and 25 Degrees. Public Kitchen is very noisy and its hard to have a conversation. I wasn't impressed with the food, either. Way overpriced and unimaginative. 25 Degrees on the other hand was amazing. Quite likely the best burger I've ever eaten. And breakfast was good too. We ate breakfast there every day we were there. Overall, I wouldn't recommend the hotel as there are many more options in LA. The only thing I would say in defense of the Roosevelt is that it is definitely a young persons hotel and its clear that the hotel caters to a younger crowd.",Don&#39;t book the Cabana Room if you are looking for peace and quiet!,,3.0,4.0,4.0,,,Sebastian K,Front Office Manager,2017-05-03,"Dear JeremyPF,

Glad to hear you were able to explore the hotel outlets and get a little taste of everything - although we wish it was overall more positive, we have to agree the 25D burger is amazing!

As for the points on the room we constantly strive to improve the room product and take all feedback to heart. We will look at what options we can provide our guests for a better stay experience with regards to your direct feedback.

We hope we do see you again and would love to bring you back in one of our tower rooms for a fresh experience.

I have stayed at the hotel thrice, it has some amazing rooms facing the pool! 

The rooms along the pool are very nice during the summers and can be good fun. Hotel is meant for parties socialising meeting people and having a fun experience! 

They have decent sized rooms but very nice bar and amazing pool parties! 

If you are looking to party socialise and have some amazing memories this is the place to be. Around 3 years a back they used to have a very nice club though i didn't notice it on my last visit! 

Hotel is right on the Hollywood boulevard so you are not far from touristic things and can hop on to be to any clubs pave u wish to go!

Have fun, cheers!!",,,,,,,,Bre S,Director of Guest Relations,2017-02-27,"AnkkitV,

Yollm123,38,"Toronto, Canada",2017-02-28,COUPLES,2017-02-20,3,Great if you can get it for a bargain,"Room was small, which we had expected. Very tight quarters.
Queen bed was not a queen, double at best.
Stayed on the third floor.
Tub didnt drain, AC made a horrible whoosh sound every time it came on, maid service was amazing, hotel location very convenient to the bus and metro line.
Hotel was a little run down, painted over base boards where you can see the old coat of paint but modern amenities. Too much sales stuff all around the room, taking up too much space.
Free wifi in the lobby.
They put us on the third floor knowing there would be a premier party that night and we felt like we were at the party minus being there! Little more thought if there are events would of been expected.
Again, if you can get a deal then it's worth it, but don't pay more then $200usd a night. I would stay again if I paid less.
Close to metro and buses, right on Hollywood Blvd. Staff are helpful with providing maps but late by 15 min on the wake up call.
Saw coffee served after the premier event that kept us up all night but never again was it available.
Restaurant 25 was very good for burgers and breakfast,  minus too much bread on the burgers and the hot dog was just ok, not worth it for $10usd for just the hot dog. Sides are extra.
We got free breakfast because of the mistake during reservations which was a nice compliment.
Overall, good if it was 3 star place.

Cbv963,32,"Houston, Texas",2016-03-31,BUSINESS,2017-02-18,5,Best stay!,"This hotel is a must see if you're staying in LA. I love LA history and the golden age of hollywood and this hotel will transport you to another time. It's been lovingly maintained in common areas, you can practically imagine yourself walking the Spanish style steps to the first Academy Awards ceremony. There's even the intact upstairs game room, that's open in the even.  While the hotel retains it's original charms, the rooms are beautiful and almost totally updated. They have a beautiful style and modern comforts of a luxury boutique hotel. The bathrooms are small, but that's too be expected. It's also preserved original tile.  The pool area is hip and rockin, an oasis transforming a city center hotel into a resort. My only regret with this stay, was it was only one night! 

The location is pretty terrible, because Hollywood is a tourist trap with crap restaurants and terrible chain shops. The hotel and the Chinese theatre across the street are the surviving remnants of a bygone age. Despite its bad location, I would still recommend it because of its rich history, which more than makes up for fighting tourist hordes. I rented a car, so it was easy to drive to better, more authentic LA haunts for meals and site seeing. But don't plan to go walking about, it's a huge disappointment, the whole commericialization is totally depressing. One bright spot of the location is the driving proximity to the original Hollywood neighborhoods that bear beautiful Art deco architecture and the road to the Hollywood sign and Mulholland beyond. Overall, think of the Roosevelt location as the jumping off point. If you love old Hollywood and Art Deco, this is a must see!",,5.0,5.0,,2.0,,,Bre S,Director of Guest Relations,2017-02-27,"Cbv963,

PBJIlly,50,"Sherwood, Oregon",2017-02-28,FRIENDS,2017-02-13,5,Great Service,"A group of us stayed at the Hollywood Roosevelt the beginning of February. We were split between different rooms. The room I stayed in was a double bed with a queen sofa sleeper. There was quite a bit of room for us to spread out in. The bathroom was updated and very nice. My only complaint was that the sofa sleeper was uncomfortable. My bed mate switched to a roll away bed and I used the couch without the pull out. Our view was directly onto Hollywood Blvd. which provided us with endless entertainment. Every morning for breakfast a large group of us would congregate at 25 Degrees. They had a good selection. Our favorite waiter was Jesse and he always took care of us-even though we probably overwhelmed him at times! We also enjoy all the areas in the lobby we could sit around and talk. We had drink and appetizers one night at the bar. The food was very good there, also.

Right smack dab in the middle of it all - across from Grauman's Chinese Theater, the Dolby Theater and the Highland shopping area, the Roosevelt is a great place to stay to experience the Hollywood of today and the Hollywood of the past. The hotel's history is fascinating and plays a big role in its look. Classic California architecture is everywhere. And while the rooms have been upgraded they still have that old Hollywood feel to them. We loved our stay. And the staff was beyond accommodating. They seem to be ready for any request from guests.

The best part of the hotel was the pool area and restaurant.
Room was small, decor nothing special. Bathroom tiny. I appreciate that it's an old hotel so size of rooms reflected by that.
Considering the cost of a room we were surprised that there was a charge for wifi and water was $6 a bottle!!
If you just want to look at the Walk of Fame and the Chinese Theatre then this is a good location but the surrounding area felt quite shabby.
In future I'd stay in West Hollywood to be more centrally located, with more modern hotels for the same cost and a bigger choice of bars etc in walking distance or easy uber.",,2.0,5.0,4.0,,,,Sebastian K,Front Office Manager,2017-08-22,"Dear Heather T,

fraidycats,641,,2017-02-28,FAMILY,2017-02-10,5,Best of all worlds,"I was very pleasantly surprised by how much I LOVED this hotel. The charm and history of old world Hollywood can be seen and felt through out but it has been lovingly restored and cared for. We stayed on the 10th floor of the tower with a view of the Hollywood Hills. Noise was never an issue and the updated hallway and rooms looked as if the decorator left minutes ago. The bed was quite possibly the most comfortable hotel bed ever. The rooms are not exceptionally large but not as small as I expected either. The staff has been well trained and was exceptionally friendly, something I was not expecting for such a ""hip"" space and location. The front desk, valet, waiter at 25 degrees, scorekeeper at the spare room and bar tender at the Tropicana Lounge by the pool all went out of their way to make us feel welcome. Whoever does the hiring and training should be commended for their exceptional staff. Service on par with Ritz Carlton. The Tropicana pool is a calm and beautiful oasis in the heart of Hollywood, and the Spare Room was sooo much fun!! We reserved a lane 3 weeks prior to our visit for a Saturday night and are so glad we did!! Fancy designer bowling shoes did nothing to improve my game but the scorekeeper kindly offered a few pointers. The gorgeous lobby was full of Hollywood folk in tuxedos who were attending an awards event across the street which added to the charm and Hollywood vibe.  Younger guests may want to stay in a room overlooking the pool. Highly recommend staying here if in the Hollywood area although I am not enamored with Hollywood Boulevard. Reminds me of a smaller version of Times Square before Disney took over. Surprised not to see a police presence on the street given the number of homeless and tourists.

rstandly,52,"Sequim, Washington",2017-02-28,FAMILY,2017-02-07,2,Historic hotel but not an accomodating one,"We booked this hotel because it was close to where my brother's funeral and celebration of his life was being held. At check-in, our double room reservation magically became a single king room with no explanation as to why it changed. Being extremely tired from out flight, we just wanted to rest, so we took the king room.  The desk clerk said the room was quiet because it was on the 11th floor.  Now, my idea of quiet must be different from the hotel's idea of quiet. There was a persistent electrical hum (not loud, but noticeable) originating from outside the room (we never found where it was coming from). If it would have been a constant hum, it wouldn't have bothered me.  However, it would hum for 12 seconds (yes, I timed it), then stop for 10 seconds or so before starting again.  It didn't disturb my wife as much as me and I found myself waking up over and over during the night because of it - oh and because of the sound of the elevator motor kicking in every time the elevators were used. 
In the morning, we noticed that there was no coffee maker in the room. My wife called the front desk to find out if there was supposed to be one in the room and was told that the rooms didn't have coffee makers.  She was told that coffee was available on the ground level near the elevators during morning hours only.  At check-out, we mentioned to the gentleman at the front desk how a coffee maker in the room would have been much more convenient than having to go all the way down stairs for a morning cup.  He said that they had coffee makers and that we should have been offered one when we called to inquire about them.  Apparently, the person my wife talked to didn't want to be inconvenienced that day.
On the plus side, Hollywood Blvd. is right out the front doors and the Metro station is just down the street.
I, for one, will probably not stay at the Hollywood Roosevelt again.  I feel, for the prices you pay for rooms here, the staff could have been a little more accommodating and you should be able to expect a restful nights sleep without the annoying noise.  There are other hotels in the area worth checking out instead of this one (Loews Hollywood or even Days Inn on Sunset Blvd).
For reference, our room was #1130 (avoid if at all possible).
Also, if you drive yourself to this hotel, be warned that parking here is $46.50 per night.  There is a parking structure across N. Orange and another on N. Sycamore that are much more reasonable price-wise.
I must applaud the housekeeping staff here. They are exceptional! And I appreciate the three white roses that were in the room when we arrived. The theme color of my brother's celebration of life was white and they were shared with other family members at the service.",Avoid room #1130 (electrical hum and elevator motor noise),2.0,2.0,,,,4.0,Sebastian K,Front Office Manager,2017-05-22,"Dear rstandly,

Thank you for taking the time to share your experiencing with us. We are sorry you weren't able to join us during better circumstances and truly sorry that we did not do our part to make the experience more palatable. 
I am glad to say we did fix the issue with the elevator noise as it has been an on and off again issue that our elevator company has finally been able to resolve. We will share your feedback with the front desk staff as we should have anticipated your needs/requests better, and we will be sure to celebrate the kind words you had for housekeeping with the team.

Zppalee,27,,2017-01-31,BUSINESS,2017-02-04,4,"Great stay in Hollywood, but beware the extras...","I love the Roosevelt and have stayed several times on business.  It's central (hard to find a good hotel actually IN Hollywood), the rooms are great and well appointed, and the pool is magic. I love that many of the historic details have been preserved and that there's still an bit of gritty Hollywood right outside.  And the accommodations are actually a good value for a boutique hotel. 

 The downsides are the upcharges -- drinks, food, valet parking, etc.  I get the pool upcharging for drinks (I think the general public can come in, and so a service charge is added, in addition to gratuity), but $20 for a subpar glass of white wine feels a little lame.  And the restaurants are fine, but nothing spectacular.  You're somewhat held hostage in that Hollywood Boulevard is a dining wasteland, but jump in your car or grab a cab and you could do much better.   The overnight parking is expensive (and again, you don't have any choice because there's no 24 hr parking nearby unless you want to risk street parking), but I get that it's Los Angeles and you're paying for the convenience and location.  

All in all, the staff is very gracious and friendly and again - the rooms are great.  I have avoided staying in the cabanas by the pool as I'm usually working and hear it's noisy.   The tower rooms also have great views of the Hollywood Hills and/or Los Angeles and it's nice to be up above the riff raff.","Choose the tower for a quieter stay.

Meggy T,1,,2016-12-31,FAMILY,2017-02-02,5,Quick Fly By Stay at Excellent Location,"My family and I went on a three part vacation in December, starting in Los Angeles, with a day in Universal Studios, and culminating in a trip to Catalina. We were looking for a quality hotel to stay in just for a night. A friend recommended the Hollywood Roosevelt and we're so glad we came. We were put in touch with Francis, who was extremely professional and delightful while helping us book our reservations. We reached the hotel after a long day at Universal Studios, my mother, little sister, and I, looking particularly bedraggled. The hotel was - beautiful. We were checked in by a very professional gentleman named Henry, who was lovely, despite the fact that I'm sure I didn't make very much sense that late in the evening (I probably made even less sense to the equally lovely Holly who checked me out the next morning at god knows when. I still think about the coffee. But I digress.) The hotel was beautiful and excellently decorated. I mean, really, I wanted to buy the furniture. Our room was very spacious (important for family vacations.) And the shower was larger than my bathroom in NYC. I could go on about the complimentary robe to use and the excellent toiletries, or the fact that I could turn a full circle with my arms extended in the bathroom. If I did that at home I'd hurt myself. The room amenities were awesome. I slept very, very well. In the morning we checked out, as mentioned before, way too early, but I was charmed by the breakfast that was offered. The coffee was excellent and I was enamored by the little jars of honey offered. You might say that I'm easily entertained. Thank you, Hollywood Roosevelt for your style, and class, and welcoming three bedraggled travelers from Oakland and NYC respectively. I will absolutely come back, although next time I'll come alone, and stay for longer.",,,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,Bre S,Director of Guest Relations,2017-02-27,"Meggy T,

timelvis,213,,2017-01-31,BUSINESS,2017-02-01,5,"Hollywood Hip, historical and happening","If you are going to stay in West Hollywood, you might as well go all in. And the Hollywood Roosevelt is right in the thick of things. It's situated on Hollywood Boulevard right across from the Chinese Theater and on the famed Hollywood Walk of Fame. 

The iconic hotel was built in 1927 and oozes with Hollywood history and vibe. It was recently renovated and the rooms are ultra Hollywood chic. But the hotel retains the early Hollywood charm that attracted such stars (and ghosts) as Marilyn Monroe and Montgomery Cliff.

The hotel consists of a tower and cabana accommodations. The cabana rooms are adjacent to the huge outdoor pool (with a mural on the pool bottom painted by David Hockney). I stayed in a superior Queen room in the tower for the first two nights. I was upgraded to a King Deluxe for the last two nights.

Be warned: the superior Queen, although very attractive, was tiny (275 square feet). I could barely squeeze by the huge canopy bed frame. And the desk was practical useless because there was only about six inches between it and the bedframe. Even if there had been more room, the desk was literally covered with merchandise for sale and mini-bar items.

This was my biggest complaint about the Hollywood Roosevelt. Practically everything in the room was for sale and it wasn't cheap. There were $20 flip flops, a $40 ball cap and $10 bottles of water. There was also an array of cocktails at $16 a pop or $100 for the entire selection. This was in addition to a small refrigerator stocked with liquor and snacks that would bankrupt most people's expense accounts.

I imagine part of the reason for the emphasis on liquor was the hotel policy that didn't allow outside liquor to be brought into the hotel (they cited liquor laws). But give me a break, the hotel is in West Hollywood surrounded by liquor stores. 

The Deluxe King was substantially larger(350 square feet) and the merchandising less obtrusive. But, though the Superior Queen had a shower tub, the Deluxe King just had a walk in shower.  The Deluxe King also had a closet and lots of storage space versus the few shelves offered with the Superior Queen. Both rooms had these funky, heavy sliding wood doors that blocked off the sleeping space from the bathroom and hall. I assume they were to block hallway noise. But mainly they added an obstacle when you tried navigating to the bathroom during the night.

Considering the hotel is right on Hollywood Boulevard, the rooms were pretty quiet. Though I did hear lots of screaming from the street on my last night there.

I'd recommend joining the iPrefer customer rewards program before booking the Hollywood Roosevelt. If nothing else, it gets you free WiFi and potential room upgrades. It's free, so you have nothing to lose.

There are a couple of restaurants and bars on property. The Tropicana bar next to the pool was very cool and relaxing.  I dined at 25 degrees. It was essentially an upscale burger bar. They did have healthy choices (it is L.A. after all). Looked at the menu for Public Kitchen and Bar, but I couldn't pronounce half of the items and the prices made the mini-bar snacks seem appealing.

The fitness center is located near the pool. It was small and dark with several outdated elliptical machines and treadmills. There were quite a few free weights. 

Best part of the hotel is it's location. You step outside the door and you are in the heart of Hollywood. There was even a Hollywood Premier taking place at the Chinese Theater when I was there and Vin Diesel was at the hotel.

All in all, the Hollywood Roosevelt was a great experience and I recommend everyone have it on their must stay at hotel bucket list.",Opt for the Deluxe King rooms and enjoy the extra space.,,4.0,,,4.0,5.0,Bre S,Director of Guest Relations,2017-02-27,"Timelvis,

Perth, had notified hotel. Told no room till 3, nowhere to go- despite paying above the odds to stay in this hotel i could not use the pool as they were having a pool party. 
Is it just me...or when u pay for a hotel and pool, the pool should be primarily for guests! Don't get me wrong, I'm not a Spoil sport I love a pool party....but I just feel when I pay above the odds for the stay at famous Roosevelt I at least deserve somewhere in the most far away corner of the pool away from the bikinis, louboutins and fake eyelashes to wait for a room.

But, that all changed when he unexpectedly passed away this past October. After two months of planning my brother’s his celebration of life in Los Angeles, I had to find a new Hollywood “home base”. After careful research of Hollywood hotels, I choose The Hollywood Roosevelt to stay during my time preparing and attending my brother’s celebration of his life. I could not have found a nicer hotel, with clean, tastefully decorated, well-appointed rooms with top notch personal service at every turn and great food and coffee at 25 Degrees. I was looking for accommodations that reflected the Hollywood that my brother and I so loved. The Hollywood Roosevelt is a beautiful Golden Age hotel with deep history and décor that has been updated and modern in every way for today’s travelers’ comfort. The tower rooms were decorated in a quality, tasteful boutique style that was both reminiscent of the past and very contemporary The rooms were not your typical prototype hotel room. I stayed in a King Studio and my friend, a King Deluxe, both on the 9th floor. The hallways and rooms were clean, with very comfortable furnishings, quality toiletries and a well-stocked snack, albeit costly, snack and beverage bar. The hotel offers 24-hour room service. The most amazing thing about staying at The Hollywood Roosevelt was the personal service that I received. My arrival was preceded by a confirmation email from a REAL person, the Director of Guest Relations. I confirmed with the Director and explained the reason for my visit. When an additional guest needed a reservation a few days before my arrival, I worked with the Director of Guest Relations who was able to offer appropriate accommodations without a hitch. Upon arrival I found I had a room facing the same direction as when I was at my brother’s apartment and, I found a beautiful bouquet of roses and touching poem, “Home at Last’ in my sitting area. This level of personal service was above and beyond anything I have ever experienced in a hotel anywhere. The kindness and concern shown to me was deeply appreciated. The Director of Guest Relations arranged to have my guest and me on the same floor, making coordinating our time convenient. The accommodations were exceptional and the hotel beautiful and full of vibrant energy. The food that was excellent and the bellhop and valet services quick and competent. The personal service and touches provided by the Director of Guest Relations was phenomenal. The Director made my stay, and that of my guest, feel that we were highly valued, despite our being in the middle of a very busy 300 room iconic hotel. I need to travel back and forth to Los Angeles for my brother’s affairs and I will only stay at The Hollywood Roosevelt, my new “home base”.

kris1138,129,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",2017-01-31,COUPLES,2017-01-20,3,"Brilliant location and a lot of history, but over-rated","Quirky, old-fashioned, historic hotel with a cool 'Golden 20s' atmosphere. Beautiful, prominent building in perfect location for exploring Hollywood, close to metro station.

Room didn't quite keep what the pictures promised:
Very nice hard wood floor, nice old-fashioned bathroom with modern walk-in shower. But unfortunately no toiletries except for one bar of hand soap. Also nowhere to put luggage but the floor. Four-poster bed made the room appear even smaller and led to some bumped heads. The window was frosted, so no view or telling what the weather was like. Constant noise from aircon outside. Good quality mattress, had a good sleep, but was getting a bit chilly overnight.
Very well equipped room bar with some pretty fancy bottlings of vodka – but everything at a price. Even the water, which you usually get complimentary, was $3 a small bottle.

Cleanliness:
Lots of dust everywhere, even on door fronts... literally everywhere, on tables and bar items too, even in the sink! Some hairs on the bathroom floor. Almost seemed as though this room hadn't been occupied in quite a while.

All in all a nice and classy hotel in a perfect location, but a bit overrated and overpriced. If they put more effort into cleanliness and perhaps general room decoration, and provide toiletries and complimentary water instead of trying to provide every alcohol imaginable the price tag will be more appropriate.
It's not a ""Boutique Hotel"", as they claim themselves, unless this term means something different in the USA. It's just too big for that.",,,4.0,3.0,5.0,,,Briane S,Guest Relations Manager,2017-11-22,"kris1138,

Kevin K,34,"Cremorne, Australia",2017-01-31,COUPLES,2017-01-19,4,Roosevelt Hollywood,"If you go to LA a good place to stay is the Roosevelt Hollywood. Close to the main area on Hollywood Boulevarde, rail link and all the sights. If you are driving, there is not much free parking, so be aware  valet parking is $42 per day but worth it. Another must have is book GPS on the hire car or you will end up like Chevy Chase in national lampoons- lost. A must visit is the Irish pub in the Hollywood Blvd, happy hour 12 noon to 8 pm, 2 for 1 drinks and reasonably priced meals. If you have time go to the Outlet Shops 100 Citadel Drive Los Angeles. 2 days is ok if you are time poor

David W,30,,2017-01-31,NONE,2017-01-18,5,Hollywood Luxury Today from a By-gone Era,"This is a wonderful LA/Hollywood experience.  Built in 1927, it hosted the first Oscars in 1929, Marilyn Monroe stayed here as did Gable and Lombard in their so named suite.  The Spanish tile floors and ornate ceilings in the ballrrooms speak wonders.  The steps where Shirley Temple practiced are beautifully maintained.  Our room was small but nicely appointed.  Other ""cabana"" rooms surround the pool.  The secluded pool begs the imagination to see movie stays lounging about the tropical bar.  Locaated on Hollywood Boulevard across from the Chinese theatre, a short walk to the Dolby theatre, major attractioins and about a mile from the Pantages Theatre, the location and the hotel are exquisite.

I'm writing this review before I've even checked out. 
Compressor in the ceiling woke me up every hour, like a diesel motor, with a bad bearing. 
I can hear it grinding away as I'm writing this review. 
They had a technician in my room at 7:30, he didn't get it fixed. 
I got no sleep, and now I have a 6 hour drive.
The staff is polite enough, but I wouldn't stay here if it were half the cost. 
City noises I can handle
The drunk tourists, no problem 
The loud cars, no problem 
A faulty compressor in my room?

The room was great, a large bedroom, bathroom and large separate living/dining room. Very spacious and lovely decor. Shower pressure was amazing!
One comment for management is that we had to attempt multiple times for the keycard to correctly swipe to open the door to the room and in the elevators. I know this wasn't key/ room specific as some friends staying in a double room had the exact same problem too so perhaps the system needs an upgrade.
It is also a little disappointing that in 2017 a hotel doesn't provide free wifi!

The 90-year-old Roosevelt could easily be missed by all the tourist sites and shops in the neighborhood, such as Graumann's Chinese Theater, but to step inside the Roosevelt is to step into the Hollywood long gone. The Roosevelt has been through numerous changes since it was built, but today it is as elegant a setting as you will find. And just as the Algonquin in NYC holds the history of New York literature, the Roosevelt is a virtual vault of movie history, including the ballroom that hosted the first Academy Awards. Outside the hotel in the bungalow court, you begin to appreciate all that is southern California -- poolside rooms, looming palms, and a David Hockney pool. And the hotel staff, service, and amenities add tremendously to the experience, from welcome to departure. My family happened to be at the Roosevelt at a slower time, so Mark, our wonderful host and hotel manager, gave us a walking tour of the whole grounds.

igettheheat,105,,2017-01-31,COUPLES,2017-01-03,3,"Beautiful common areas, minuscule and underappointed rooms","The Roosevelt is worth a visit, if only to soak up the history of Hollywood celebrity.  After a period of decline, it underwent extensive renovations, but they left the property well short of a comfortable night's stay.  My suggestion is to visit it, have a drink at one or two of the historic bars, but sleep elsewhere.

Specific complaints:

We stayed on Sunday night, January 1.  At 4 in the afternoon, the only bars in the hotel that were open were 25 Degrees (the burger restaurant) and the bar at the outdoor pool.  We opted for the pool bar, where they tried to turn on outdoor heaters that didn't work.  So we drank overpriced drinks while freezing.  

There are only 2 elevators for the tower, so you can have a long wait if you're on a low floor trying to catch a down elevator with any room left in it.

The room was barely large enough for the bed.  The bed was not comfortable, and the pillows were well below the par of a dive motel.  I woke up with a sore back and a stiff neck.  

The bathroom is also tiny with no shelf or other area to hold toiletries.  The bathtub has a fixed half glass pane, so to turn the water on, you have to lean way in from the back half of the bathtub.  Naturally, the lever was set to shower, so as I turned on the water with no choice but to put my head directly beneath the shower head, the cold shower came right down on my head.  The water from the shower freely splashes out beyond the half pane, so that the floor is drenched.  The towels are thin sandpaper.

We didn't have a hairdryer in the room, and had to call the front desk twice for it and stay up later than we wanted to, waiting for someone to finally bring it.

This hotel checked off most of my list of unacceptable practices: uncomfortable bed and pillows, bathroom flooded from the shower spray, threadbare scratchy towels, no hair dryer.  It was decently clean, and had some convenient electric outlets for charging; so it was not a total write-off.  I've had similar stays at budget motels where I've spent $79 - $99 per night.  That's what I'd put this on par with.",Get a room overlooking Hollywood Blvd.,,2.0,,,1.0,3.0,Sebastian K,Front Office Manager,2017-05-03,"Dear igettheheat,

We're glad to read that you enjoyed the history of the Roosevelt, we've been part of the Hollywood scene since the 1920's and are looking forward to the next 90 years.

Being a historic hotel does have certain challenges that we are tackling and overcoming each year on the rooms end. I do the fullest confidence in the room experience and we do offer a variety of rooms options that can accomdate you better.

Jo L,34,,2016-11-30,BUSINESS,2017-01-02,4,Great central hotel,"Stayed here in The Tower for a week on business alone. Room smelled of weed on arrival but went away fast, nice decor, good size room for the location. 

There's a small restaurant open 24 hours on site called 25 Degrees which I tried (huge portions, many single travellers at the bar as well as tourists). Didn't use the other bars or on site eateries.

Very touristy out on the street and grungy like Piccadilly or Leicester Sq in London, but an uber can take you elsewhere fast. 

Used the small gym a few times when jet-lagged which was well kitted out. At 6am the hotel puts out tea and coffee by the elevators (no facilities in room apart from minibar) 

Staff were friendly but hotel lacked a welcoming central space - the street level atrium was dark and empty that echoed, with a strange atmosphere not like a hotel. The other areas by reception downstairs are more like a nightclub after the party is over. Didn't use the pool as it was too cold but looked pretty. So overall slightly strange hotel but good for the room and location.

Recommend an easy walk up to Runyon Canyon from the hotel for spectacular views and cleaner air.",,,,,,,,Bre S,Director of Guest Relations,2017-05-03,"Jo L,

We parked for the first night and then returned the rented car as it's really cheap and easy to just uber everywhere. Its about $8 to uber from the hotel to universal studios and i highly recommend just ubering there as parking is at least $20. We were on the 4th floor and on the last night we could hear some music at night..so yeah..i guess it does get loud towards the weekend so i would recommend asking for higher floors but it really didnt bother us too much as we were just all so exhausted from the theme parks. i will stay in this hotel again if i want to be in the downtown area.",,,5.0,,5.0,5.0,,Bre S,Director of Guest Relations,2017-01-10,"Toastedbread,

Matt delivered my luggage to our room and I had mentioned that me and my sister were looking forward to a great evening of catching up and somehow he arranged to have some wine delivered to our room.  I really felt like a celebrity lol!!!!  The room was spacious and immaculate and the bed was wonderful.  My stay was for four nights and encountered many of the wonderful staff but a few standouts to me were Kyle (bellman) who was so friendly and helpful with getting me an Uber and a terrific smile!  I wish I knew the names of the other guys who were so helpful but needless to stay every staff member there understood the art of customer service and manners, something not always found in hospitality today.

I used to bring tour groups here 20 years ago not to stay but just visit and I would explain the rich Hollywood history of the place which there is plenty of in this 1927 gem.

Stayed in a tower room and I can't believe the transition. Great furnishings and amenities, room with a great view, pool and Gym all on offer.
I had a look at other rooms including the Cabana's and some of them were even more spectacular but the thing that really made the short stay a memorable one was the excellent staff.

Heather C,1,,2016-12-31,FAMILY,2016-12-21,5,Best birthday weekend ever! ,"I can't express my satisfaction with the Roosevelt hotel or their staff enough! After booking my reservation I received an email from Allyson on behalf of guest relations. There she offered to coordinate any transportation I needed, make desired reservations, etc. Since this weekend stay was for my birthday, and so close to Thanksgivinng, I decided to take her up on her offer. I explained that we would be out of town until the week of our trip to the Roosevelt, and that I was in the middle of packing and moving houses. I gave her a quick brief on what I had hoped to plan for our weekend stay, and Allyson literally took care of the rest. She made all reservations, suggested restaurants, customized each night based on my guests (first night was spent with my husband and children, second night was with my friends) and she even upgraded my room so that my family could fit comfortably (we needed a crib, which she had waiting for us upon arrival!) As if that wasn't perfect enough, I entered my gorgeous upgraded suite and was surprised to see personalized birthday balloons with hand written notes attached to each of them. It was honestly one of the sweetest gestures ever. She even included balloons for my two children-which they loved. From there I was treated to a birthday tray of desserts later that night, and even an email from Bre checking in to make sure everything was going well. My entire birthday weekend was absolute perfection, and I honestly felt like I was the only guest who mattered to them. Even the valet guys were fabulous! I know I'll be returning to the Roosevelt-maybe I'll make it my birthday tradition! From the bottom of my heart, THANK YOU!",,,,,,,,Bre S,Director of Guest Relations,2017-01-10,"Heather C,

Our first impression was Ozzie at valet parking. He was so welcoming and friendly it just started off our experience perfect. We then go in to check in and get Sophie and she had a great smile and told me we have been upgraded a couple levels for my wife's birthday. the room was awesome, They then sent up a card to us a little later with some really nice goodies. card from Bre, Nicole and Allison. Bre Smith director of guest relations sent me emails to check on us and it was very appreciated. Since we were treated so good we decided to spend money on dinner at the hotel. We went to 25 degrees and it was so goooood. So good we went back for breakfast. The breakfast was also fantastic with a great waiter named Jesse. I am not rich by any means so a stay here is a stretch, but they made us feel just as special as anybody else and really made my wife's birthday great. Good for me. So if anybody is considering staying near the walk if fame and the other freak show stuff in Hollywood this should be your home base , because they obviously care about there guests.

kayciereyes,3,,2016-11-30,COUPLES,2016-12-16,5,"A Flawless, Magic Experience from Start to Finish.","This Thanksgiving, I stayed for one night & my experience has always been extremely positive thanks to the staff who were the REAL MVPs/STARS of this gem. 

I've been staying at the Roosevelt for 12 years, but hadn't stayed in quite some time, but the staff starting with Ozzie the Doorman made me feel like it was I was there just yesterday. The renovated rooms are spectacular, and although I am not a fan of the bath amenities (Bring FRESH back) the bathrooms were more than adequate & the hardwood floors were a much needed renovation to the rooms. The weather was great so people were still out at the pool during the winter. The key systems were down during our stay & although most people found it inconvenient, it allowed me to talk to more of the staff throughout my stay as they escorted me to my room on quite a few occasions. Among them were Donald & Dennis in Security as well as Sean the bellman. They remained calm, cool and collected & added a lot more flavor, magic and personality to my stay.

As a repeat guest, Francis the Front Desk Manager was wonderful in making my reservation happen by doing a price-match when a third party site was advertising a lower rate at the time that I was making the reservation. When I checked in, Brian at the Front Desk gave me a complimentary upgrade which was wonderful since I was bringing my boyfriend to my favorite hotel for the first time. Both Managers, Forrest & Holly  helped me throughout my stay by giving me property information as a few outlets were closed that holiday evening. Their warmth and graciousness made me feel right back at home & I never at one point felt like I was inconveniencing them. 

I utilized Tropicana Bar, 25 Degrees (their Diner) and the Gym during my stay as well, and the burgers at 25 Degrees are next level delicious and their breakfast selection was excellent. This stay was the first time that I used the Gym and found it adequate with free weights, space to stretch and strength training & cardio machines which all functioned properly and was clean & well maintained. Tropicana Bar was well staffed even when most hotels would be cutting staff due to the winter season, so the wait time for cocktails wasn't an issue. TIP: If you check out and still want to use the pool, they have a nice outdoor shower you can use to rinse off.  

Allyson - Thank you for reaching out to me after I filled out my survey regarding my stay. It's always nice to know that those things don't fall on deaf ears. 

To the Roosevelt Hotel, Thank You for adding another stamp to a such a magical stay to a passport full of wonderful memories with you. To the new General Manager, Akshay Bahl - hats off to all the wonderful hires that you have. It is quite clear that they all enjoy their jobs and have your support and trust to let them do their jobs. I am very much looking forward to my next stay.","Let the staff know your preferences ahead of time, and let them choose the best for you based on their property knowledge",,5.0,5.0,,5.0,,Bre S,Director of Guest Relations,2017-01-10,"Kayciereyes,

andybell229,1,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",2016-01-31,FAMILY,2016-12-15,5,Excellent Hotel,"This review is way over due, I  completely forgot to actually write anything so my sincere apologies to the Roosevelt team.  In December 2015/January 2016,  my wife and my two teenage girls travelled to the US for the first time. We went and stayed in Anaheim first, and did Disneyland, then went into LA and stayed at the Roosevet over the Christmas period.

Bee Smith, Director of Guest Relations had arranged all our booking and accommodation needs. When we arrived at the hotel Bre, had completely spoilt us we had a lovely room and she had left little treats for our girls.

Bre -  i'm sorry that I forgot to write this almost a year ago, but I've just seen some of the old emails and realised my mistake. Thank you so much again for all you did for my wife and I and our girls,  you really made our trip that much more enjoyable. Lovely hotel close to many of the LA attractions right in the heart of Hollywood Boulevard.

Todd S,64,,2016-12-31,SOLO,2016-12-13,2,Rooms Above Event Center,"The front desk will give you the excuse that this is a historic property and we should respect that, but will charge you modern day prices. I warn you in advance that the standard room is one of the smallest Manhattan (oops, this is Los Angeles) rooms you will ever step into. (The studio I moved to was much larger, but the shower was a micro half shower in a tiny bathroom.)  Once you emerge from the elevator, you will find you've stepped into a motel 6 with attitude. The gray frayed carpet in the hallway with paparazzi photos on the walls might suggest a Hollywood rehab facility.  All the stars being accosted or annoyed in the photos are almost a predictor of how you will feel after staying here a few days.  Most of the common areas (lobby, restaurants, bars) were booked during my 4 night stay with events.  Owning a hotel, I know these are big money makers, but you will be made to feel like an intruder when you return to your room in the evening.  The bouncers protecting the party goers physically block your entrance.   The surliness from the bartenders is unbecoming - even for LA - even in the on-site burger joint.   Do yourself a favor, take a walk through the lobby, which is beautiful, and go stay at the hotel down the street near the Kodak theater - less history, but seriously more comfort, better treatment, and simply a better property for the same money.",,,2.0,,3.0,,3.0,,,,,23
King_Joolia,39,"Chicago, Illinois",2016-12-31,COUPLES,2016-12-13,3,"Really, Roosevelt?","Ummmm.....

Location: You can't argue that Roosevelt is in the BEST location for the typical Hollywood tourism - a walk through the historical lobby lands you directly on Hollywood Blvd. Its incredibly convenient.

Room: Part of my problem with the room was my fault. I reserved the Standard King room at the lowest price point for a two day visit as a couple to LA...and this decision showed in the small space we received. The room included a canopy bed which was lovely and soft, but very large for the small space. The bathroom (which was the Roosevelt's fault) was intolerable - from us not being able to turn on the shower to standing in a puddle of water when the shower was working to water being splashed all over the floor due to the small glass pane, I really hated showering here. Its also not the quietest hotel either. I will give Roosevelt kudos for the modern feel/decor of the old tower, but I was a little unhappy with the room. 

Service: We were not in the room much and we're not needy people, so our few interactions with staff was the front desk at check-in/out and valet. Both were great, no complaints.

Policies: I have one major issue with the deposit at $150 per night: its too high. Considering that we paid only a few hundred to stay here for two days - the deposit equaled to 60-65% of the total cost of the room. I understand that its LA (I'm from a large city), this is to be expected, but it just seemed very steep for this hotel. The deposit {on top of expensive valet only parking and resort fees} adds up. (I hope others feel my pain about budgeting for trips!) 

Pool: The heated pool is fantastic!!! I recommend an early morning swim - its delightful and peaceful. I echo other reviewers who stated the pool bar is loud at night - but keep in mind, its one of their two main attractions (the other is the historic lobby).

Overall Grade: C. I just didn't love Roosevelt. The overall value of the hotel isn't worth the price for me - besides the pool and location, I was left unimpressed. I would strongly suggest paying for a larger room.",,,,,,,,,,,,12
Troy M,2,"Trafalgar, Australia",2016-11-30,FRIENDS,2016-12-12,5,Amazing Hotel even for a few drinks,A group of friends and i stopped by the Roosevelt for a few quite drinks on our travels as we had a layover in LAX on our way home to Australia and decent to after seeing the city stop and relax for a while. We went into the main entrance and sat at the bar and was served by a man named Antoine and he had to have been without a doubt THE best bartender we had experienced on the trip he was such a laugh even when dealing with 11 rowdy Australians all drinking at his bar he never missed a beat and even helped us charge phones behind the counter so we could contact family back home after our phones had died hours prior. We also went outside to the pool area and it was amazing although we didn't get to swim the poolside looked immaculately clean and the plants where terrifically placed to reveal snippets of what awaits you,,,5.0,5.0,,5.0,,Bre S,Director of Guest Relations,2016-12-13,"Troy M,

After making my reservation I was immediately contacted by guest relations. As this was my Christmas present to some friends I wanted to do something special. I asked if gifts could be delivered to their room. Bre did a great job of making sure this was taken care of. My guests were impressed with the special touch. Upon check-in they upgraded the rooms. My room was a cabana suite which had an awesome balcony that looked down on the pool. Great room for entertaining. The customer service at this hotel cannot be compared. Every person we encountered was friendly and extremely accommodating to anything we asked. Inside the hotel you forget all about the chaos in LA. Already looking forward to coming back in the summertime to enjoy the pool.   ,,,,,,,,Bre S,Director of Guest Relations,2016-12-13,"DCCR336,

The location has everything you need, there is this magic in the air, I really believe i'm the director in a movie staring me. This place is so amazing, I feel hollywood. 

The staff is amazing, they are always beyond helpful, they have always gone above and beyond and I feel like i'm treated like an A-list Celebrity, but more importantly like i'm family. VERY VERY rare in all of my Travels. 

I have to give a special shout out the my ""Hollywood Dream Team"" or atleast from what i've seen the Hotels dream team. I'm usually pretty articulate with my words as i'm a professional speaker for a living.... all I can say is I LOVE THESE TWO!!! #LOVEBREANDALLYSON 

I can't explain it, you will only know what i'm taking about when you meet them, or you will know that if you had a special stay, they were probably part or the whole Midas touch to you Oscar Winning Award feeling during your stay.

The venue was only a 5 minute ride from the hotel which was extremely convenient. The employees at the front desk were very nice and professional. The check in process took less than 5 minutes... which was great because I had just sat in LA traffic for over an hour! I was offered a bell man but declined since I only had two bags. Once entering my room I was extremely pleased at how clean everything was, housekeeping really did an amazing job!! Presentation is everything!! I was starving so I decided to go to one of their restaurants downstairs... the servers were great! Food was good too! To my surprise I was sent champagne and chocolate covered strawberries.. the gentleman who delivered them to my room was so nice, he opened and poured each of us a glass with a big smile on his face!

JocelynKC,7,"Los Angeles, California",2016-05-31,FRIENDS,2016-11-22,5,Staff was great! Loved the pool!,"We chose to stay at the Hollywood Roosevelt for a girls birthday celebration a couple months ago and had an amazing time. Our plans were to attend a concert at the nearby Greek Theatre but we also mainly planned on enjoying the hotel.

When we first arrived the front desk lady Sophie was very welcoming, checked us in quickly and answered all of our questions.  We let her know we were celebrating a birthday party and she was so nice and gave us drink tickets and some great dinner recommendations. We decided to chill by the pool until we had to get ready for our concert. We were able to comfortably lounge poolside and order food from the Tropicana Pool Café. The pool was warm, the music was fun and it was great to just tan and people watch, it had such a cool L.A. vibe to it. It felt like the place to be and it was hard to leave!

We had a group of 7 and booked two deluxe doubles and were able to get our rooms right next to each other. The rooms were beautiful and clean and the beds were super comfortable! Because we were celebrating a birthday there was champagne and cookies waiting for us once we got into the room, which was so sweet and awesome of them to do! Before we took an uber to the Greek Theatre we used our drink tickets at the bar downstairs and the bartenders were so nice and the drinks were delicious. 

The hotel itself is so unique and located right in the center of everything in Hollywood with tons of things to do within walking distance. The staff really made an effort to make our celebration special and I will definitely stay again!",,4.0,5.0,,,5.0,,Bre S,Director of Guest Relations,2016-11-30,"Jcunanan17,

Used the happy hour 330-6 at 25degrees burger bar to our advantage which looks onto Hollywood Blvd. The Tropicana pool area again fits with the Hotel vibe, so hit the water if you get half a chance.

We stayed in a King Studio Suite on the 11th floor for the first two nights of our honeymoon.  Let me give you the rundown. The staff were delightful and accommodating.  The lobby, bar, pool and room were a fever dream of old Hollywood gorgeousness. The burgers (though pricey) were sublime.  The location was tourist central, but the hotel itself was filled with insiders and was a private and quiet respite from the insanity of Hollywood Boulevard.  We only had two days before heading off to Big Sur, so the locale was perfect for getting as much in as possible, the hop on hop off tour buses pick up right across the street and there are plenty of bars, restaurants, and whacked out tourist attractions within a stones throw. We found our favorite stars on the Boulevard, we drank champagne while spying on a film premiere from our window,  we swam where Marilyn swam!  Also, the SHOWER. WAS. THE. BEST.  We stayed in 6 hotels over the course of our honeymoon and the room (including bathroom) were definitely the prettiest, but also the most comfortable and best functioning.

I booked a one-night stay here to cap off my little sisters first time in Hollywood. Before check-in the valet staff, and Rocco were fabulous, and took care of all our bags without me even asking. I was a little nervous checking in, because official check-in didn't start til 3:00,and we arrived just before 2:00. I requested a high floor when I booked the trip a few weeks ago, in hopes my little sisters could see all the sights of LA.  Our original room wasn't ready yet (understandably), but Sophie at the front desk found us an upgraded room available, featuring a stunning view of the Los Angeles skyline. I can't stress how greatly that unnecessary act was appreciated, my sisters LOVED it. And I can't say enough how enjoyable the entire staff made our brief stay, even the security gentlemen in the main lobby area were kind and helpful anytime we needed help finding a street, establishment, or part of the hotel. I will definitely be back for any other special occasions in the Hollywood area.

The issue we had was noise, from staff, from paper thin walls and other residents, from the road that round at the back of the property. This was compounded by the response to our complaint, which was to pass it on, never hear anything and then get into a bartering war at the front desk about how much we wanted off the bill.

Add to this the exorbitant fees charged for wifi (free wifi in lobby, were you get stared at by serving staff when you don't buy a drink) and for bottled water and it started to feel like an anti-customer experience.

On the upside, the rooms look fantastic, location superb and the pool area's legendary status speaks for itself.

Also, after complaining again via the hotel's official feedback system, a further discount was given and an apology made.

And he had confirmed ordering a flower arrangement for in the morning, which was also never delivered. Hotel offered breakfast vouchers as a compensation, but that does not help the completely ruined occasion.

Staff is friendly - Ozzie (spelling?) when you pull up is always on it, handling the car, the people, the luggage -- super friendly as is the rest of his team.
Front Desk staff is super nice but always seems to be understaffed with long lines. 
Pool Team is great but again understaffed - takes a very long time to get service because there aren't enough staff.  Even the cleaning crew is very friendly -- always a smile.

If you want quiet, this isn't the place for you -- it's fun and loud and busy --  great energy.  Especially poolside -- I love coming to Hollywood and checking in here for a few days and relaxing poolside and doing some Grade A people watching ---

I wanted to create a memorable Mommy/daughter Hollywood/LA experience for them. After reading hundreds of reviews I decided on the iconic Hotel Roosevelt. I couldn't have made a better choice; besides the location being exactly in the heartbeat of Hollywood, this hotel has history, glamour, personality, staff were all so nice/helpful, rooms were clean and beautiful. The mixology at the library bar is spot on and breakfast at 25 degrees is delicious. The extreme standout was BRE SMITH of guest relations. I wrote a simple email telling her that we were coming and why....she made our trip EPIC. Hotel Roosevelt and staff made two 25 year olds and their mom's have memories to live a lifetime.

I am a big fan of the Thompson Hotel chain, but this legendary hotel, while in an amazing location (across the street from the Chinese Theatre in the heart of Hollywood) is for sure their worst property.   It is big property that lacks any sort of character at all.   They nickel and dime you for everything.   I have never seem so much crap in a hotel room with price tags on it in case you want to buy their branded junk.   It felt like a super tourist Days Inn rather than a luxury property.

Rohan N,11,,2016-10-31,FRIENDS,2016-11-01,5,Very Memorable Birthday Stay !,"I have been staying at a lot of hotels recently. Mostly they have been faceless chains that although offer a consistent product I can’t think of any stay which stands out. They are all pretty much the blurred into the same room service, rooms and cold service. So when I decided to celebrate my birthday I wanted to stay somewhere different, I walked past the Hollywood Roosevelt countless times and heard a lot of good things; so I decided to say no to another faceless chain and give the Roosevelt a try. 
Best decision I have ever made! From the point you drop your car at the valet to get your room everyone at the hotel treats you like you are the only guest. The check in was super-efficient and the rooms understated but comfortable. The mini bar with pre made cocktails was a great touch and actually quite good! 

Pool:
Spent the majority of my time here and the guys at the Tropicana bar are extremely attentive and the food is great too. The oysters, grilled short rib cheese melt and truffle fries were my favourite! The pool attracted a great crowd who were very friendly with a mix of old and young!  Great to people watch and mingle with great music. There was a DJ most days from what I can remember.  

Spare Room:
Unique bar and venue with an old school bowling alley, sad that we only went here the last night and not discovered it earlier. The bar tenders are extremely knowledgeable and make great cocktails - try the Dark and Stormbay.

Room Service: Came back one night and was craving pancakes although it wasn’t on the night menu - the room service attended still made them and offered a load of sides (salted caramel sauce etc as well!) small things like this made a big difference. Other than that room service was always timely and of good quality - I particularly liked the breakfast the eggs benedict were great and mimosas delivered chilled! 
I could go on as it was truly a memorable stay; Bre in particular was amazing in ensuring this with welcome champagne ,chocolates and a birthday card in addition to having pool bed ready before we even checked in! An asset to the hotel.  The location of the hotel is great with lots of great restaurants, bars and clubs about - I recommend Katasuya , Catch and OO-Kook-Korean BBQ both nearby. 
Look no further if you are looking for a place to stay in Hollywood!",,,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,Bre S,Director of Guest Relations,2016-11-03,"Rohan N,

SpaceMtnFrontRow,7,,2016-10-31,COUPLES,2016-10-30,5,Amazing location for central Hollywood,"Firstly, the location can't be beat. From the lobby level you can walk straight out to Hollywood Blvd directly opposite the Chinese Theatre. It's also a short Uber or Lyft drive to most other sights in the area. We never waited more than a few mins for a driver to pick us up.

The hotel is a Hollywood landmark and you can feel and see the history but it's definitely been revamped and has a young vibe. We didn't checkout the bars or pool but from the guests we saw around the area and the talk of big pool parties it's obvious that they're popular.

We stayed in a king room which was a very nice size and was located facing Orange Dr. From the room we could still see the walk of fame and even the Hollywood sign but I guess the street noise would have been quieter than facing directly on to Hollywood Blvd.

The bathroom is superb considering they have to work with a small space from the original hotel layout. 

All the staff we interacted with were great, especially Juan from room service who was more than happy to provide some tasty vegan options that weren't listed on the menu.

Perfect hotel for checking out the big touristy areas of Hollywood and for those interested in Hollywood history.",,,,,,,,Bre S,Director of Guest Relations,2016-11-03,"Dasamuel,

The service is truly bar-none. From the valet ran by Ozzie Garcia to the cleaning personal. They truly have a great staff. 

We stayed in a cabana room which was really nice and beautiful inside however there's a downside with staying in a cabana.. It can get really LOUD and stay loud still 2AM. If you're a light sleeper and you go to bed early you have feel tortured. This is just a warning truly for people who this would bother however for myself and my wife it was totally fine. 

One suggestion for the hotel.. Truly for what it is there should be nice coffee machines in the rooms like nespresso's.. It would be a nice touch for such a premium hotel.

made1024,225,"Miami, Florida",2016-10-31,BUSINESS,2016-10-29,2,Probably never again!,"I HAD to stay at this hotel for a work function and while I love the history behind it and the lobby area, pool and garden area are beautiful and kept with the ""old time"" theme, this hotel did not work for me.  For starters, I checked in early and they gave me a room on the 12th floor.  The hallway was excruciatingly hot, once in my room I was claustrophobic.  The room was tiny! and I was in there alone! couldn't imagine sleeping there with 2 others.  I requested a room change later that evening and it took 4 calls to get this done because they wanted to bring the keys to the new room over to my room instead of just meeting infront of the new room or having me go to the lobby to get the key.  New room was big and comfortable, and they were nice enough to keep it at the same rate as the previous hole in the wall, however NO COFFEE MAKER in the room!! for crying out loud even holiday inn has coffee makers in the room! Strike 3 for me (small rooms, hot hallways, no coffee maker). I ordered coffee which room service told me was ""complimentary"" since it was 530 am, funny that I had to sign a receipt for $4 service charge to bring coffee to me room, so essentially it was not complimentary.  The floor in the bathroom seemed dirty so I wiped it with some toilet paper and it wasn't dirty it was just stained from not properly cleaning it.  The small velvet couch in my bedroom was stained with marks that seemed to be bodily fluids, so I didn't go anywhere near that one!  The hallways reeked of marijuana smell, day and night it was just unbelievable.  Maybe it was just someone on that floor that spent the entire weekend high but it was quite uncomfortable given that there is no A/C in the hallways just an open window by the elevators.  Valet parking is a whooping $46 per day and you can't overnight park in the public parking across the street, at least that is what I was told.  One night my coworker asked for an ice bucket at the front desk and they said they could get it for him for a FEE! Everything in this place had a ""fee"" attached to it. I do have to say the bed, pillows and AC in the room were excellent.  The pool and garden areas are also very pretty, but don't order food there bc there is a ""fee"" ie; a $16 salad on the menu ended up costing a coworker $31 bc she had it by the pool.  I just thought it was insane all around.  It is definitely in a great location since you are on Hollywood Blvd and directly across the Chinese Theater, Dolby Theater and has stores all around, but I'd rather drive.",a deluxe room at this hotel is the size of a normal room at any other hotel,,2.0,5.0,5.0,,,,,,,140
Chris F,104,"Unley, Australia",2016-10-31,FRIENDS,2016-10-28,5,right in the heart of Hollywood,"Location was great, and everything was great. Except for a noisy night club near the pool area. I was travelling with a mate for the Desert Trip weekend. We had 2 rooms which we paid extra for to be near the pool. This was recommended by another Trip advisor reviewer. But it seems the night club goes until 2am and is at ground level with the cabana rooms. The patrons from the night club seem to still hang around the pool area until 4 am and forget that there is 40 plus cabana rooms nearby. Maybe the staff should get all party goers to disperse after 2am and keep the peace and quiet we paid for. Don't get a room near the ice machine as it is really noisy when the ice hits the bottom of the steel ice buckets provided. We were unhappy with this night club noise every night, so we made a complaint to the manager because we were returning after the weekend for another 5 nights which was already paid for in full. We were upgraded to a suite in the main building. Everything else was 10/10.",DONT  get a room near the pool,,5.0,,5.0,4.0,,Bre S,Director of Guest Relations,2016-11-03,"Chris F,

adamjon1,6,"Gold Coast, Australia",2016-10-31,FRIENDS,2016-10-28,2,"Was ok, but not worth the money! ","This was a let down to what we were expecting. The young guy on the front desk lacked personality or any kind of enthusiasm. I have better service from someone who worked at McDonald's. Like someone else has said on here, unless you're famous you're treated like a peasant. The guy on the front counter clearly didn't like us. We were not told about anything that was happening at the hotel during our stay, the guests checking in next to us were being explained about a pool party, and performance in a restaurant and so on. You have to pay for wifi, even though the guests next to us were given it complimentary. We were told by this same guy that late check out was $300, yet the next day someone else told us it was $150. 
The room was ok, large and had a nice view. Bathroom was updated and had a large shower with an odd shower head. The bed was a double bed, (looked even smaller cos the room was so big) was uncomfortable to sleep next to my partner as I felt I was going to fall off. 
Nothing outstanding here for the money. Oh and then we were charged $100 for parking and again got pretty poor service from the valet. Had to put our bags in ourself and waited a while for the car.... which was literally 2 spaces away from where we were standing...??? Maybe train your staff and change the beds and I'd consider staying again for half the price. ",,,,,,,,,,,,1

Audra S,14,,2016-10-31,SOLO,2016-10-25,5,"Great valet, front desk and bellman staff","I was an LA resident for over 10 years, but came back to visit family and friends. I'm very familiar with the property and the same goes for most LA hotels. For the location and quality, you can't beat the price. The location is great for tourists or someone who wants to have central access to Downtown, Beverly Hills and the Valley. If it's available, spend a little extra to have a poolside room. It's much more spacious and who doesn't want to look out to palm tress? 

I work in hospitality (to no knowledge of their staff) and being that I do I love to give special acknowledgement where deserved. Thank you to the valet team for your patience with me taking forever to unload, front desk for being so personable and professional and the bellman for his great energy. They were the only staff members I interacted with, but although I never met housekeeping my room was cleaned well so a special mention to them as well. 

If you feel like indulging grab a bite at 25 Degree's, their 24 hour restaurant. It's a great place for a post night out meal and the truffle fries are to die for.

04684,36,,2016-10-31,COUPLES,2016-10-25,4,A Beautiful Old Hotel,"We liked the hotel.  The reason we chose it was because of it's proximity to the tours.  It was great for that - however, not a great location for restaurants or other fun.  The hotel itself is kind of weird, with reception in the basement in the back of the hotel...there is no one at either of the two main entrances.  Security was at the main entrance one night, but none the other two nights we were there.  Anyone from the street, which was alive with ""street people"" could come in.  When I hopped off the elevator one morning to grab coffee (no coffee pots in rooms, how did I miss that) there was a young woman with ""all her belongings"" helping herself to the coffee, and she scurried off when she saw me...other than the old Chinese Theatre and the new inside shops and restaurants next door, there isn't much to do in the general area of the hotel.  The hop on - hop off bus loads almost next door, and so that was good.  And we were pleasantly surprised to find Sammy Haggar's Cabo Wabo Cantina inside the new mall across the street.  The food there was good.  The tequila was better.  The salsa was the best.  We tried to eat at the pool cafe but found the menu very narrow, and the main restaurant was very expensive for what seemed to be fairly plain.  I gave the hotel 4 stars because they gave us an upgrade and a bottle of champagne for our anniversary...otherwise, it would have been a 3.  The room was nicely updated - but the bathroom was ridiculously small - the toilet only barely fit between the wall and the sink and I could barely fit on it.

demsaboj,1,"Melbourne, Australia",2016-10-31,COUPLES,2016-10-23,1,A very disappointing end to our honeymoon,"Not sure where to begin. Upon arrival we were greeted well by reception and even given free wifi (we were astounded that you even had to pay for this considering it's free everywhere else). The guy who brought us our luggage was lovely too. That's about all that was good about this place.. we can't believe we prepaid & had to spend 6 nights here. If you're a 'nobody', you will surely not forget it while staying here. Staff around the pool area are pretentious and rude to no end. Went out to the pool on the 3rd day & was told to take a day bed by one of the waitresses. I was then approached by the pool reception girl & told to get off as I did not have a reservation and was not on the waiting list? Meanwhile every good looking hipster from the street was taking a seat with their friends. The way she spoke to me was demeaning and appalling given I'm a paying guest. It was hard to get served at any hour of the day. Once we started spending however the waitresses would come to us more frequently. We haven't had one descent nights sleep as every single night there has been people raging outside our room (we stayed in a Cabana room but not facing the pool). On one of the nights I literally thought a woman was being attacked as she was screaming and making THAT MUCH NOISE down our hallway. Other nights we had a bunch of guys banging on our door at 3.30am just for fun! Walks are paper thin. The smell of marijuana is constant and mixes in well with the dusty old carpets in the hallways. Considering there are children at the pool area I would think staff would be more vigilant about people openly smoking weed at the pool. The cleaners did a very sub par job, on occasion only replenishing us with one towel, no replenishment of toilet paper and leaving dirty soaked cleaning sponges on the bathroom floor as well as their bobby pins. Despite it being hot in LA, our outdoor bed was saturated when we arrived and it stayed that way for the next 6 days, filthy and covered in dirt and dust and wet towels (not ours). They also don't know how to tread quietly in the very early AM through the hallways, slamming doors and cluttering with people's room service that's left outside their doors. On one occasion a cleaner came into our room despite a do not disturb sign and us telling her we didn't need any services. The absolute icing on the cake however.. on the last day we decided to extend our check out by 6 hours. $150! We then went out up the street and when we returned were once again greeted by rude pool reception girl & some other guy who demanded to see our room key so that we could enter the corridor to our room??? We had been there for 6 nights!? When we told them we were guests & simply going to our room and not to the pool party that was to the left of the corridors they demanded that we needed to get a stamp on our arm? Like we're at a bloody club & not guests at a hotel!? We then returned to our room to find they had checked us out anyway & we couldn't get into our room. Despite the fact that this place is a rip off for what you get (small bathroom, crap shower pressure & sofa seats that had liquid and pen all over them) its staff need to learn how to treat people!! Not just celebrities etc, normal people! We have spent our last day here in our room because we genuinely feel uncomfortable being anywhere else in this hotel. Will never stay again and will never recommend to anyone. Unfortunately this has been the worst hotel we have ever stayed in, literally. A very sad end to our honey moon. I understand that it's iconic and a hot spot etc but advertise the type of rooms on your site for gods sake! (E.g if you stay in a cabana room don't expect to sleep). People like us from Australia had no idea what we were getting ourselves in to. If you're after a crazy night, have loads of cash and look good.. by all means go for it, otherwise don't bother.",,,,,,,,,,,,13

It's too dark in decor and as such feels slightly gloomy, certainly not the old Hollywood glamour it claima to possess!  The bedroom was dark and gloomy also.   I'm sure that's not what they were aiming for but it's what it felt like to me.  The food in the restaurant was seriously average.  The burger bar was ok.  I got really annoyed when as a paying guest was told after waiting for the elevator to arrive for some time that I couldn't get in it as it was being used for guests to an event upstairs.  Perez Hilton then got in the elevator and we were left standing waiting!  Seriously uncool!!

Thee hotel is practically across the road from the Chinese Theatre and puts you right into the action.

My only real problem (and it's relatively small) is the lack of coffee facilities in the room. I woke up in the morning and wanted to make a coffee not walk to the coffee shop outside the building (which isn't the first thing you want to do in the morning).","If you stay in the Cabanas, try to get one on the side of the pool, otherwise its a bit of a trek.",,5.0,,5.0,5.0,,Bre S,Director of Guest Relations,2016-11-03,"Pete L,

Thank you for taking the time to leave this review and share your feedback. I'm glad to hear that you thoroughly enjoyed your time with us for the most part, and I apologize for any inconvenience that you experienced due to the coffee... or lack thereof. We have complimentary coffee by the pool and elevators from 6-9AM, but I understand that is not always the most convenient hours of operation. Anytime you plan to stay with us in the future, please reach out and ask for me directly. I would be happy to ensure that you have a coffee pot in your room.

She was incredible. Also Richard at the front desk was so lovely and helpful. He felt like an old friend and nothing was ever too much of an ask and always happy to help us with any queries we had.

Matt D,2,,2016-10-31,COUPLES,2016-10-17,2,Not great,"We were really excited to stay in this hotel. Arriving we were stunned, extremely beautiful hotel in a great location! Staff on the check in desk were really friendly. First impressions of our room were that it was beautiful, we were excited.

Unfortunately things went downhill from here. The view from the room was the back of a sign, couldn't see anything. Taking a look around the room there was so much stuff you had to pay for that you barely had enough space for your own things, everything was ridiculously expensive.

TV remote barely worked and difficult to not scold yourself on the taps and showers.

Wifi was not free and cost $15 per day for the slowest speed, the whole thing felt like an app drowning in in-app purchases, such a shame.

There was free wifi in the lobby which was extremely slow. The icing on the cake was when we were sat on a bench in the lobby and asked if we were guests, we said we were and were then told ""they don't like it when you sit here"" and told to move on. There were no signs or barriers indicating this and we saw many people sitting there over the next few days. 

Such promise but very disappointing overall. 2 stars for the interior and the location.",,,,,,,,,,,,2
Danaeg,140,"Melbourne, Australia",2016-10-31,BUSINESS,2016-10-17,3,Mix of the old and the beautiful and the very loud and obnoxious,"I have mixed feelings about this one. We checked in and as we were business customers we were checked into the 12th floor of the Roosevelt tower. The old part of the hotel is very historic, very dark, and moody. The rooms were relatively clean, however dusty, but bed was comfortable. After seeing the pool area the next day, we asked for a change to a cabana room, and a lovely manager called Marlon changed us with no issues and discounted our upgrade charges. The cabana rooms are more stylish than the tower and right next to the pool. We felt like we were in an Elvis movie. But thats really where the fun ceased. We had no idea that cabana rooms were the 'party' rooms, and that by 'upgrading' to these rooms one shouldn't expect any sleep. The bar music is played extremely loudly from 10am right through to 2am, and the double glazing is not sufficient to block any noise. There were no earplugs supplied also. We got over this and thought ""hey this is Hollywood"", however on two of our 6 nights we had neighbour guests partying very loudly until 6 am. We felt a bit embarassed to say anything, so chose to stay out late every night rather than come back to our room before early morning so we could get a few hours of sleep. The food at the pool bar was very tasty however very expensive. This hotel really is a tourist trap, i think you should consider staying here only if you are willing to forgo sleep and party the night away. It's an expensive way to party though!",only stay here if you want to spend heaps of money and have no sleep,,4.0,,,4.0,4.0,,,,,114

rattat,43,"Calgary, Canada",2016-08-31,COUPLES,2016-10-13,1,These thieves will steal your personal items!,"I am absolutely and utterly disgusted by this hotel. My husband and I made the BIGGEST mistake staying at this location in August for our first wedding anniversary. We had a Camry rental and spent 2 nights 3 days at this hotel. We valeted our car - because they forced us to. I would be more than happy to park my own vehicle, but it was not an option. Upon picking it up, we noticed that two pairs of sunglasses were missing from the center console of our rental. We talked to management, security and head of valet. They shut us up that day because I was very upset and causing a scene. The security assured us they would do an investigation, review the tapes. However, the security footage only records where they take the car and the first three floors of parking. Security advised us to file a police report which we did. We wasted our entire day dealing with this. The management of the hotel did NOTHING except tell us that they would wait for the investigation. The valet manager said he couldn't do anything until the investigation went through. They assured us they would give us an answer in 24-48 hours. After countless calls and emails, I heard back from the original security officer and he simply said nothing was found in the security footage - of course you couldn't see anything! A thief would not pull up in front of the cameras and steal our items. 

In the email he said a manage from valet call us and follow up. Can you guess it? NO ONE CALLED. I called and emailed back requesting someone to follow up and no one has. So this is my outlet. DO NOT trust this hotel. DO NOT trust this valet. Do not waste your money here because they will steal your personal items and then say its your fault. The valet manager said, ""you shouldn't leave personal items like a wallet or purse in your car."" Thanks buddy, We left sunglasses in the car that we wear when it is sunny and we are driving. 

Please do yourself a favour, DO NOT stay here. Go somewhere else. I will continue to share my experience with anyone who is willing to read it.

Hotel Roosevelt, thanks for ruining my anniversary, ruining my trip, ruining my entire experience. Thanks for the anxiety and stress. You should be ashamed of yourselves.",,,1.0,,,,,Sebastian K,Front Office Manager,2016-10-17,"Dear rattat,

We truly do apologize for the experience you had with us. Regardless, of the occasion this should have been handled very differently; we will be following up with our valet company about proper handling of guest claims and follow up times. Additionally, I wish we had escalated this situation internally and handled the issue more directly ourselves as this was the last thing you needed to have to deal with during your stay with us, especially during your anniversary celebration. I do want to close this issue out for you and restore your faith in The Hollywood Roosevelt and have reached out to you via email to resolve this.
Once again, our sincerest apologies that we did not handle this in a timely and appropriate manner as well as the experience itself but we will strive to make this right.

Lovely hotel, nice quirky design with lots to shout about including the spare room where the retro wooden 2 lane bowling alley is & they serve amazing cocktails. Bedrooms are well designed with lovely large comfy bed, nice soaps etc. Rooms are small for what u pay & our view was moderate (looking into walk of fame but overlooking rooves of building below and outdoor car lot). Bath a little small & hard to use shower without scalding yourself until you get used to it. The burger bar they rave about is just ok nothing spectacular. This hotel would be brilliant & reasonable value for money if it were in a different location - for where it is it's too classy & over priced. What I meal by this is the type of person who wants to stay here will not want to walk along the road to any of the shops of restaurants locally - they're rubbish & very tacky, in fact it's quite a scruffy area surrounding it & that spoils what the hotel creates. Along with the very expensive $46 dollar/night valet parking for guests!) This hotel would be much better placed in Santa Monica or Beverley hills but they are both driving distance.

The hotel itself is OK and the room is OK, but the pool party did live up to what was expected. Was really busy and good young crowd. The area is on hollywood blvd which is really touristy/tacky too (I prefer staying on sunset blvd). I wouldn't stay here again unless I really wanted to go to that pool party again.",,,4.0,4.0,,,4.0,,,,,65

If you have a chance get a cabana room by the pool - nothing like walking out of the room onto the pool deck and jumping on a giant inflatable Swan! 

The Library bar in lobby is epic as well as the restaurant! We had an excellent brunch at 25 Degrees also in the hotel. YOU MUST visit the spare room (2nd floor bar) with bowling lanes!

My husband and I have stayed several times in a cabana suite next to the pool, comfortable lounge chairs, amazing pool side wait staff and delicious lunches. The dinners at ""25 Degrees"" and ""Public Kitchen and Bar"" were so good! They offer traditional American faire and a lot of healthy options.

The rooms, although small, were immaculate & well stocked. The pool is definitely an amazingly picturesque icon, with this hotel having so much history. The main desk for check in can be a challenge to locate if you enter via the front doors on Hollywood Blvd as they are located on the ground floor (below the Lobby on the street entrance). Staff are very helpful & there's nothing they can't do, just ask! There is a no alcohol rule, so you are not permitted to bring alcohol onto the premises, but if you have duty free or purchased goods, they will store it for you. We found this strange (being Aussies), but can also see it reduces issues on premises & also boosts the economy of the hotel & local business. If you're using public transport, the Metro is just across the street & safe to use during daylight. Hollywood blvd itself is safe to use anytime if you stick to the glitz & glam parts. This hotel is definitely amazing, & the price tag is surprisingly good when you consider where & what it has to offer. ",,,,,,,,Bre S,Director of Guest Relations,2016-10-03,"Amanda S,

David K,47,"San Francisco, California",2016-09-30,COUPLES,2016-09-26,5,Right Where You Want To Be...,"I have been spending time in LA  for decades, and constantly try to find the best hotel for the situation.

After a few exciting trips and many disappointments, The Hollywood Roosevelt is the place for me and my friends.

The location is very central for fun, and I have realize staying by the beach is not as fun as staying in Hollywood, and driving to the beach by day, no matter what anyone tells you.

My wife and I had a reservation for just one night on a Saturday. As we approached the front desk, we were politely greeted by Francis Badia, who took excellent care of us, and after many hotels on this trip that were half as nice, with twice the attitude - I felt at home. As a business owner in the service industry myself, Francis is an incredibly hard to find employee these days. I hope the hotel management is well aware of this.

The rooms have been updated lately, and I can tell you that they put the Viceroy, Mondrian, W, Standard, and Ace Hotel rooms to shame.

The pool is awesome here, despite the dreadful pool boys who work there. They could learn  a thing or two from Francis. Matter of fact, aside from the Valet's sometimes being overly stretched out, or the pool boys who take out not making it in the industry, on the guests - this hotel is perfect.

The only comparable hotel that is fun without an overly stuffy vibe is the Chateau Marmont. At double the price, I will stick to the Roosevelt for my future good times.

PS. The bed is one of the absolute most comfortable I have ever been in. My woke up saying the same.",It&#39;s a little more mellow away from the pool if you want a quiet room.,,4.0,5.0,,,5.0,Bre S,Director of Guest Relations,2016-10-03,"David K,

McNiks,190,"Melbourne, Australia",2016-09-30,FAMILY,2016-09-26,4,Comfortable,"Enjoyed our stay at the Roosevelt. We were situated in a Tower room that was quiet and private. Rooms are stylishly decorated, clean and well maintained. The bathroom was absolutely tiny though and as a family of 4 proved to be a challenge. We were unlucky enough to be in a room with an over bath shower (a personal hate of mine). The shower had weak water pressure which made it difficult to wash my hair. It also looked a little worse for wear - looked more like it had been 'refreshed' rather than renovated. Housekeeping were efficient, beds very comfortable and all staff we came across were lovely and helpful. We were celebrating a special occasion and were pleasantly surprised when some delicious goodies arrived at our room! Overall we felt very comfortable at the Roosevelt and would consider returning in the future.

KenzBenz15,88,"Doha, Qatar",2016-05-31,FAMILY,2016-09-20,4,Cool and historic hotel in the heart of hollywood,"My husband and I stayed at this hotel with our 10 month old daughter for 4 nights, at the end of a california road trip vacation. On the positive side, the hotel is cool, stylish and historic, and you really get a taste of old hollywood glamour through the decor and interior. The rooms are spacious and the decor was really nice. Bathrooms are tiled floor to ceiling, they don't have bathtubs but huge showers. 
On the negative side, we were disturbed by noise every night but the last, due to an extremely noisy generator or AC or similar on the roof, and the fact that we were on the top floor just beneath the Penthouse suite. It also caused vibrations that we felt through the bed, so, it was quite disturbing, especially with a baby to consider. One night there was a party in the PH which also caused a lot of disturbance. For this reason i advise families to ask for rooms on the lower levels. In addition, like most hotels in the area the valet is very expensive - we used a car park down the road for much cheaper. Finally - if you're looking for a hotel that you can just step out of and walk the streets and soak in the atmosphere, consider this one carefully - personally, I was surprised by the run-down state of hollywood and the high number of homeless, drugged up, people around.",Avoid top floor rooms due to noise from generator and/or penthouse parties,4.0,4.0,,,,5.0,Bre S,Director of Guest Relations,2016-09-26,"KenzBenz15,

The hotel is located directly on Hollywood Boulevarde directly across from Graumans Chinese Theatre, so it is in the middle of everything. Right from the word go everything was wonderful.  The room was comfortable.  Unknown to us our travel agent had advised the hotel that this was our 35th anniversary trip, so there was a lovely tray of chocolates awaiting us in the room. The reception staff were extremely helpful in enabling us to arrange our connection to a difficult airport shuttle company.
If you need to find where things are in the surrounding area go no further than the car valets, especially Ozzie. These guys know all the ins and outs.
We would definitely recommend this hotel to all our friends.",,,5.0,,5.0,5.0,,Bre S,Director of Guest Relations,2016-09-26,"Dstubbs2016,

bwco,1734,New Jersey,2016-09-30,COUPLES,2016-09-17,3,"Fantastic hotel, however I did not feel safe walking outside of the hotel at night","We stayed here for a few days this month. My wife and I do a lot of traveling, and we have never felt so welcome by any hotel as we did here. The staff is the most friendly and helpful we have ever seen. The hotel is immaculate and perfectly maintained. 

The reason I am only giving it 3 stars, is that I did not feel safe walking outside at night. I walked outside at 6 am several days and saw homeless people sleeping on the sidewalk near the hotel. I saw questionable characters walking nearby the hotel. As compared to New York City, there is a minimal police presence in this touristy area. I know the hotel cannot control these things, but the hotel owes it to its guests to provide some security. The checkin is in the back of the hotel, not facing Hollywod Blvd, so there is no one at the Hollywood Blvd, side.  Only once, on a Friday night, did I see someone, who may have been hotel security, at the front door. We paid over $400 per night, and if I am paying that amount, I expect to feel safe when I walk outside the hotel. There needs to be some type of security for the guests on a 24/7 basis.",,3.0,5.0,,,4.0,,Bre S,Director of Guest Relations,2016-10-03,"Bwco,

Thank you for taking the time to leave this review. We are constantly working to improve our customer experience, and feedback like this helps us do so. I'm sorry if at any point you did not feel safe in the area surrounding the hotel, but I assure you that we have security on staff 24/7, as well as constant camera review, making sure our guests are safe both inside and outside of the building. We do everything we can to make sure our security measures don't impede on the guest experience, and if you felt that there was a lack of security watching over you during your stay, I promise it was only visually.

Tippygunn,16,,2016-09-30,FRIENDS,2016-09-15,5,Great stay at the Hollywood Roosevelt,"On a whim my friend and I reserved a room at the Hollywood Roosevelt and it was so worth it! We were welcomed by the valets staff and the check in process was very quick. Our luggage was delivered so fast and the bellman/valet was charming and helpful. We started off with drinks at the Public Kitchen bar and Greg was awesome and made wonderful drinks. Later we had appetizers at the Public Kitchen which were pretty good. After going to the Pantages Theatre to see a musical we ended our night at The Library - one of the bars in the hotel. It is a charming little room where the bartenders make any drink you want based on your likes. They have fresh ingredients, wonderful service and a very cool atmosphere. Ask for David - his drinks were incredible and very creative.

We stayed on a Friday night so the pool area was the party zone with music until 2am. We ordered room service which was delivered promptly by a very friendly staffer - even though it was 1:30am!

The next day we had brunch at the poolside Tropicana Café - very yummy!!

Every single staff person we encountered was helpful and friendly.

The building is quite old but has been cared for very well and is quite beautiful. There is an old Hollywood feel to the place yet is it very modern. We stayed in a ""Cabana Room"" which was smaller than expected however it had everything we needed. The hotel does not offer free Wi-Fi in the rooms which is a bit of a bummer considering the cost however, since we were only staying one night, it wasn't too much of a bother. I'm not entirely sure I would stay here with a family but it is situated in a good spot on Hollywood Blvd - located very close to the TCL Theater (where the hand and foot prints of the stars are located).

Overall it was a wonderful experience and, even though we were only there for 24 hours, it felt like a true weekend get away. My friend and I agree - we would definitely go back to the Hollywood Roosevelt!",Cabana Rooms are near the pool party area which are subject to loud music until the early hours of the morning.,,5.0,,,4.0,5.0,Bre S,Director of Guest Relations,2016-09-26,"Tippygunn,

Being from NYC, our hotel standards are pretty high and the Roosevelt again exceeded all expectations. The hotel is super classy, clean and in a great location.  Rooms were spacious and ours even had views of the Hollywood sign.

Hotel staff was even more impressive - especially Rocco and Ozzy who work the valet - extremely helpful and friendly throughout our entire stay.  Also had a great experience with an event we held at the hotel pool with the assistance of Maria, a member of the events staff.  She helped us plan every detail and it turned out to be a fantastic party!

The room was a good size for the city the bathroom was the small but was something expected for the historic hotel. The bathroom had looked updated but there was a separation of the tub and the wall and chipping on the tub. Maybe the separation was overlooked at the time and only had gotten worse? 

The bars in the historic lobby are a must. The Library Bar was great if you like to try to new drinks. There is no menu but the mixologists just need a few things from you, preferred liquor, sweet vs. not sweet and you can let them take it from there. We were not disappointed from our concoctions. With no menu there are no prices listed which means the drinks are not cheap. If you want cheap this isn't a good spot for you but if you want laid back not overly crowded it's worth it to check it out. ",,,,,,,,Bre S,Director of Guest Relations,2016-09-09,"Heather H,

Newly renovated rooms are pleasant and comfortable. Great location for Hollywood.  Only complaint is parking costs are exorbitant, and should be disclosed.  It probably makes sense to use public transportation or rideshare rather than park here.  If you do need to park, you can leave your car overnight across the street in the famous complex for a fraction of the cost.",,,3.0,4.0,,4.0,,Bre S,Director of Guest Relations,2016-09-09,"Lgca11,

Nicki D,2,"New South Wales, Australia",2015-12-31,FAMILY,2016-09-02,5,Amazing first time family stay will be back again Hollywood Roosevelt is the place to stay,"A bit late to review but better late than never :) 
We stayed at the Roosevelt for 5 nights in December 2015 checking in on Christmas Day 
After we booked this hotel I had read reviews and some things people were saying I was a little worried like the lifts Were really really slow and rooms were small bathrooms as well but so not an issue at all for us but I suppose everyone has their different priorities.
No problems with the lifts
Room was amazing 
Bathroom as well 
And noisy
And quiet I'm sure in summer it would be a bit noisy but hey your in Hollywood amongst it  would you want it any other way i know I wouldn't :)
well let's start with Bree she was so amazing to us as it was our first time traveling to LA and we decided to stay at the Roosevelt because it looked super cool the position and had seen it in movies before and we so made the right decision.
We traveled as a family of 2 adults and 2 children aged 7 and 9 
we arrived Christmas Day after a long flight from Australia we were able to check in early in the morning and Bree had also arranged something special for the kids when we arrived to our room.
Room was amazing we stayed in a double deluxe room plenty of room for us also the shower was massive and the kids enjoyed looking out the window at night checking out all the lights and action.
We had Christmas lunch downstairs in the restaurant once again amazing 
Staff was very friendly my husband wanted to hang in there every night very cool decor.
Would definitely recommend it and will stay hear again at the drop af a hat just wrighting this review brings a smile to my face thinking of the awesome time we had hear at this hotel it felt like home.
Hop on hop off bus right across the road ,Chinese theatre,LALA land across the street for night time snacks and a little tea and coffee shop as well.
I can't say enough to about this place but I'm sure if you stayed hear as well you too would have an amazing stay as well.

By contacting the hotel in advance I reserved the the double deluxe room and was able to snag the room with 2 bathrooms, which I must say came in very handy.  The hotel is located on Hollywood Blvd which reminds me of Time Square and its conveniently right across the street from Madam Tussards and a number of restaurants are close by.   I reached out to Bre Smith prior to my arrival and she was very helpful and even followed up with me by email to ensure I checked in ok.

I'm sorry that your experience here with us was not all that it could have been. We are a historic property, so all of our rooms differ in size, shape, and location within the hotel.

AliciaA90028,2,"Melbourne, Australia",2016-08-31,FRIENDS,2016-08-30,5,Iconic hotel with legendary customer service,"I just got home from a wonderful summer holiday at the Roosevelt Hotel. I cannot thank Bre Smith enough for helping me secure a booking during the in demand summer period. I was accompanied by one of my best friends on this trip and on arrival we were met with an incredible room with a view of Hollywood Blvd, champagne and the sweetest welcome note in the world which was the best thing to walk into after a 20 hour flight.

We checked out for a day trip and rechecked back in a couple days later to another incredible room overlooking the pool which we later spent a lot of time in.
I can't commend the staff enough for their friendliness. Everywhere you go in the hotel you are met with helpful and kind faces. Whether it be the sweet housekeeping ladies asking how your day is going, to the attentive doormen asking if you need help with your shopping or the pool attendants making sure you have everything you need and putting you in the prime spot for sun baking.
My friend that I was travelling with is a travel agent and had some work questions about this wonderful establishment that we love and asked Bre if we could somehow have a proper tour which Bre arranged straight away with the lovely and informative Justine.
Justine showed us the infamous Gable suite which we had only read about in our quest for knowing more about our favourite hotel and had never dreamed of stepping foot in. It was like instantly being transported back to that time that is so neatly preserved on the top floor. We were also lucky enough to go up on the roof right behind that huge iconic sign which was really surreal. The views were absolutely breathtaking. 
We were also lucky enough to see the infamous Marilyn suite which was really special to us and we are now going to save up and treat ourselves to a night in it on our next visit. 
The staff really and truly go above and beyond for their guests and we were really grateful for an insider peek into some hidden gems in the hotel and it has only made us fall even more in love with it.
I really cannot wait to get back there and I will not stay anywhere else in LA. It's truly my wonderland filled with the sweetest staff and always an absolute delight to visit.",,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,,Bre S,Director of Guest Relations,2016-09-09,"AliciaA90028,

Thank you for taking the time to leave this review. Learning how we can better improve our guest experience is invaluable to us. On weekends, especially during the summer months, I know it can be quite loud. I apologize for this. We do our best to separate the people looking to party from those who are here for a good night of sleep, but there are times we are unable to accommodate everyone. It sounds like you were not accommodate properly, and for that I truly apologize for that. As summer comes to an end, and fall is upon us, I would love the chance to make it up to you.

Jasmine at the front desk was super friendly and courteous. I was less so after an awful day of travel. But, the room upgrade (Thanks Bre!) was much appreciated and started the vacation off right. The room was wonderful: spacious& clean with hip/modern amenities. And it had a great view of both Hollywood Blvd. and DTLA (Room 909). I immediately made my way for the Lobby Bar in the historic hotel lobby. Bartender, Tiffany, was also super friendly, professional, and made a quality cocktail. During my stay I also enjoyed breakfast at the 24-hour restaurant, 25 Degrees. Solid breakfast and burger menu. Good service. Spent every morning at the pool reading the paper and having a drink. The pool gets crowded early when the sun is out. But, great, relaxing spot.

CaseyP808,32,"Naples, Florida",2016-08-31,SOLO,2016-08-26,4,Nice for a party weekend ,"I booked a last minute 1 night stay for a stopover in LA to visit a friend. I normally stay at sunset tower but got a good deal on a room here so decided to give it a try. Renovations and new decor are cool and the bed was very comfortable with nice linens. I enjoyed the afternoon at the beautiful pool area and  the location was convenient for touristy things, lobby very pretty. 

Overall, I had a positive experience but I wouldn't personally stay here again for the following reasons: 
- Room I got was annoyingly small (can't open closet and bathroom doors at the same time or have either open if you're in the hallway or want to open the room door, just aggravating with luggage!) on the 3rd floor with a dingy view of a rooftop. Bathroom didn't have enough places to put toiletries down, one tiny shelf and a pedestal sink. They actually placed the tissue box on the toilet tank - doesn't that indicate maybe you need to add some shelving?!
- Renovations still don't make it a luxury hotel in my opinion so I would not pay their regular rates (I was quoted $499 per night by the hotel when I booked, got a lower rate on another site).
- WiFi fees. Nickel and diming at $15 a day, just build it into the room price, everyone has a smart phone they want to connect...
- Noise! My room had DJ music bumping from the pool area when I went to bed at midnight. Also you can hear water running upstairs and loud AC noise, unavoidable in an older building like this so it didn't bother me, but again, not ok for a luxury hotel. 
- My room wasn't that clean - hair and dust on floors and in corners. 
- Had to fight for a pool chaise - annoying that they were all claimed and none of the attendants offered to help. I had to lap around until I noticed one with a dirty towel but no stuff on it and asked if I could sit down. No one came to offer me a fresh towel or take my drink order. Again, fine for me, for price paid but would expect more for $500 a night.

If you're coming for a short stay to go out and party in Hollywood this would probably fit your needs perfectly! If you are expecting a luxury experience, I wouldn't recommend. ",,,,,,,,,,,,51

I love the old Hollywood feel.  We have stayed in the Cabana Balcony, Cabana Poolside, The Marilyn Suite and Gable & Lombard Suite.  We love the Cabanas because they are around the pool and near the Tropicana.  We love being able to walk out of our room & be right in the middle of the action.  Surprisingly there was never a time it disturbed us.  They have done a great job making the rooms feel private.  Because of the comfortable patio, I would say the poolside is my favorite.  We loved the Marilyn Suite but the balcony wasn't really furnished.  The Gable & Lombard Suite was a must try for us.  We laid poolside looking up at that roof terrace too many times.  The suite was beautiful but needs some major TLC.  The paint looks like it lived through a lot of fun parties.  It could be much better with some sprucing up but really needs a full make over.  The roof terrace was not furnished but they brought us some chaise lounges.  We spend more time there than anywhere else.  The views are spectacular.  We literally spend an entire day up there moving the chairs around getting different views.  Public Restaurant & Bar is fantastic.  We at least go once every visit.  Our favorite place to have our first and last cocktail of the night is the Library Bar.  I love cocktails with fresh fruits & herbs rather than syrups.  It's a great place to meet friends, lounge on the comfortable sofas and drink a Pimms Cup while taking in the grandeur & beauty of the room.  25 degrees.... Not my fav.  The food is okay but we had a streak of rude staff that makes it less appealing.  I would go with room service first.  It's 24 hours by the way!!  The location on Hollywood Boulevard is also something we enjoy.  We have taken many late night walks we would have never taken if we weren't right on the Boulevard.

The location is perfect, as it is right on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and just a few blocks down from the Dolby Theater. Another amazing aspect was the In N Out Burger three blocks from the hotel, which also did not disappoint.

The hotel staff were all so kind, from the smiling bellman, to the super pleasant front desk team, who also gave great suggestions for dinner during my time there.

I wasn't able to check out all of the bars on property (there are 8!) but I did get to enjoy some drinks at the Spare Room. I highly recommend the 'You're Killin Me Smalls' it was quite delicious. Also this lounge has a two lane bowling alley!

It was packed crowded with club goers as we pulled up at 11PM on a Friday - seemed appropriate for LA and Hollywood Blvd. The lobby was also overflowing from the hotel club with wildly dressed clubbers and I really felt like I just stepped into an LA party pretty cool!! Rooms are small, yet very modern (and updated, as it is an old building), clean and comfortable. Don't remember if it was perfectly quiet, but I think is decently sound proofed, as the party goes on late. The party at the hotel pool the next afternoon was also in full swing by 1 PM.

PhoenixL,11,,2016-06-30,COUPLES,2016-08-22,5,Hooray for The Hollywood Roosevelt!,"7 years after getting married my husband and I finally got away on our honeymoon, to California. It was a special trip and we enjoyed every minute of it. Although we had carefully planned almost every part of our vacation together, I did not realize that my husband had something extra up his sleeve. 

After a drive down the coast, we were going to end the trip with 3 days in LA, concluding with a movie premiere at the TLC Chinese theater. While we were researching possible accommodations, I realized that the Hollywood Roosevelt was just across the street from the theatre and daydreamed about staying there. I'm a huge movie fan and it is the quintessential Hollywood hotel. All the golden era stars had stayed there. The first Academy Awards were held there! It has its own Walk of Fame star!

That said, we were on a budget, so I put my daydreams aside and we chose a lovely boutique hotel about 10 minutes away.

The day of the premiere my husband revealed that he had arranged for us to spend our last night at the Roosevelt! He had worked with Bre Smith, director of guest relations, to have our luggage picked up from the other hotel and moved to the Roosevelt without me even knowing. I was flabbergasted. I couldn't quite believe it until we opened the door to our room and saw all our things there.

But that was just the first of many surprises. Bre had arranged for us to receive a stunning room overlooking the Chinese theatre. The Hollywood sign (and the iconic Hollywood Roosevelt sign) were all in view. 

The room was breathtaking - at once chic and timeless, with a four poster bed, desk and chairs, plus Spanish-style barn-doors to provide privacy between the washroom, bedroom and hallway. Roomy and stylish, it was pure elegance.

To top it all off, a bottle of champagne and a plate of macarons and chocolates were waiting to welcome us, with an equally sweet note from Bre. 

The hotel and Bre's amazing attention to detail gave us a fantastic experience - one worthy of classic Hollywood, and one that made our honeymoon worth the wait. 

Go see for yourself what a beautiful, historic hotel this is, in the heart of Hollywood.

Thank you Bre for helping my husband make this an extra-special occasion.",,,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,Bre S,Director of Guest Relations,2016-08-29,"PhoenixL,

I'm so glad that we were all able to come together and pull off the surprise, which sounds like it went over quite well. I can't take all the credit myself; Mark, our Bell Captain, and Javier Pesqueira, one of our Front Desk Managers, both assisted in not only pulling off the surprise, but making sure all the accommodations were set. 

We loved having you, and were happy to be a part of such a fun story. We hope to see you and your husband again soon. Anytime you want to book with us in the future, please reach out and ask to speak with me directly. I would be more than happy to ensure more amazing memories are to be made here at The Hollywood Roosevelt.

Most of the hotels we have stayed in have been large and modern. This one was a bit different and we liked it a lot.

This is a hotel that has a lot of history and lots of interesting decorations and features.

We stayed in a 1 bedroom suite, which was great for a family of four, plenty of space.  The food and service in the restaurant was excellent. The location is perfect for anyone wishing to explore all that Hollywood has to offer.

Sorting out the affairs of a relative dying from Alzheimer's is unbearably stressful and if at all possible I stay at the Roosevelt when I'm in town. Even though it's situated in one of the busiest intersections in the world I always manage to sleep like the dead. That deep rest allows me to tackle whatever business I have to and gives me something to look forward to after a trying day. The new barn doors are a brilliant idea- the room was so quiet I didn't even need ear plugs.  Housekeeping is great and quick. ,,,,,,,,Bre S,Director of Guest Relations,2016-08-22,"skeletonkeys555,

princesspink72,5,"Boston, Massachusetts",2016-08-31,FAMILY,2016-08-19,5,Another Great Stay at the Hollywood Roosevelt,"We had stayed at the Roosevelt a couple times in the last 15 years on our visits to Hollywood.  This is the first time we saw it renovated.  I have to say I like the old Roosevelt.  The check in is now downstairs and not in the beautiful lobby.  It seemed to be a small area for check in and lacked the grandeur of before.  The person who checked us in was great.  She was efficient and aimed to please.  After check in you have to go down a few stairs to the elevators.  I had a mobility scooter and the only option was to use a small lift they installed that took me down the 3-4 stair length.  It was very difficult to get the scooter in there.  If I had a larger one it would not have fit.  It was a bit embarrassing to have to cram myself and scooter in there as they tried to close the half door.  After that, I just went out the front door of the hotel and around the corner to the valet. We had a King Suite.  The suite is large with a huge living/dining room area with a full size dining table and huge couch.  The bedroom is separate with a king size canopy bed. The entrance way into the suite is quite small.  Two people have to do a dance to get around each other. No room again for a scooter. The hallway was so small you couldn't turn the scooter to even get it into the living room or bedroom.  I am not complaining about any of the scooter issues.  I just want anyone else using mobility aids to know what it was like.  The living room and bedroom had great views overlooking Hollywood Blvd.  It was beautiful lit up at night and surprisingly not loud at all considering all the activity down below at all hours.  The bathroom was a bit small and not a lot of space to lay out toiletries.  The shower was great though.  Lots of room with a marble bench seat.  My only complaint about the room was the strong smell of fresh paint and the way they had the tv mounted on the wall in the bedroom.  The pole of the canopy bed blocked the view if you were on the right side of the bed.  You had to move all the way over to the left but if there was someone else on that side you couldn't move over enough still to see without the darn pole there.  Room service was expensive, but expected I guess.  There is a great coffee shop right outside the hotel on the corner that had everything so we went there each morning to get coffee and feed the kids.  There are 2 restaurants in the hotel but we didn't get a chance to try them although the menus looked good.  My last comment is about the valet parking. There is a charge per night of $24.  There is about 4-5 handicap parking spots in the parking lot.  I had wanted to park there myself since we had to load and unload a scooter and/or wheelchair.  It was easier than pulling up to the valet and having another car pulled up right behind blocking access to the liftgate.  When we arrived we were allowed to just park ourselves no problem.  We went out later and came back and went to self park again.  The night valet manager came running over as I was getting out asking what we were doing and proceeded to hold my door so I wouldn't open it too far near the car next to me.  There was plenty of room and no danger of hitting it.  He then says we can't self park because they are liable. He was very rude in my opinion. None of the cars parked in the handicap spaces had placards except mine. So after a bit of discussion I got tired and just gave them the keys.  When I came out the next day they had moved my car out of handicap and still insisted I needed to wait for it even though I could see it in the parking lot.  I was not disputing paying the daily parking fee. I expected to pay it even if I parked myself.  I just didn't want to load my equipment in the valet line.  All in all we had a good stay.  Everyone else we encountered there was nice and willing to help.  We would stay there again since we do love the location. It really is a nice hotel with a lot of history.",Ask for a room overlooking Hollywood Blvd if you want a great view.,4.0,4.0,,,,5.0,,,,,2

For 24 hours. ,"The room couldn't be faulted (even if a little small). When we arrived there was a couple extravagantly kissing in the car port. We couldn't get past and none of the 10 valets standing next to them asked them to move to one side, even when we pulled right up to them. After about a minute of awkwardness we crept past, only for a valet to tell us we couldn't Park in the space we'd found because they needed to park it (which was fine just not sure why none of them came and told us that when we were parked right next to the 10 of them whilst we waited for the couple to stop kissing.) hospitality felt a little cold on welcome. We were then informed that parking cost 46 dollars which was extortionate when we were only spending around 12 hours overnight in the hotel. The valet charges you that amount, and then simply drives your car into the multi storey next door if it isn't flash enough for their car park in front of the hotel (giving you a long wait when you come to collecting it). Water in the room was between 6 and 10 dollars. We were scared to touch the shampoo as it seemed like everything else incurred a charge. Over all, the room was nice, but beware, the hotel is aimed at super rich who don't care if they have to pay 25 dollars for an omelette.",,,,,,,,,,,,0

Astro K,42,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",2016-07-31,NONE,2016-08-12,2,Family holidays,"The place is all about location. It is on Hollywood boulevard on the walk of fame. It is convenient especially if you want to go out in some of the trendy restaurants and clubs in the neighborhood. 
Otherwise, the hotel is old. In some of the room, the ac makes some much noise that it is impossible to leave it on at night. In other rooms, it is the plumbing that makes a terrible noise. 
We booked 3 rooms including one ""bungalow"" by the pool. 
While it is nice to be closed to the pool, one cannot enjoy the terrace or the pool during the week-end because of the private parties taking place. The DJ is good though but if you want to rest or if you have young children, then it is definitely not the place to be. 
Avoid any room which ends with 19 as you will be closed to the elevator and to the ice distributor room; if you add the noise from the ac and / or the plumbing then it will spoil your stay. 
The mini bar is good with a wide range of products. 
The menu from the room service is not bad either. The croque-monsieur and the burger are actually quite nice. 
The staff is nice and friendly but lack training.

Lisa Kridos Edgington,7,"Woodland, California",2016-08-31,FAMILY,2016-08-10,5,The Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel gets 5 Stars!! I would give it 10 stars if I could!!,"The hotel and the service is first rate. The rooms are large and spacious and the service is impeccable. We had our daughter's wedding there and it was magical. The Blossom Room is amazing and our wedding coordinators at the hotel Ana Maria Graves and Claire Morris were on top of everything. The food, the service, the attention to detail was first rate. Robert the banquet manager was on top of everything. There was never a need that was not served with a smile by the staff. Ana Maria Graves was with us throughout the whole process answering questions, providing great suggestions and making sure we had the best wedding ever. It was effortless and beautiful. All I can say is stay at The Hollywood Roosevet and if you want to have an event you will never forget, do it at The Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel with Ana Maria and Claire. I could go on forever - weddings are supposed to be so stressful but Ana Maria and Claire took out all the stress. Great choices for appetizers, the entree and desserts were five star dining.

TJP-Scottsdale,104,"Scottsdale, Arizona",2016-08-31,FAMILY,2016-08-07,5,Awesome Hollywood Classic - Highly Recommend,"Reviewing a 2-night stay @ Hollywood Roosevelt - overall outstanding experience - awesome location (caddy-corner to Chinese Theater - equivalent of Times Square in Hollywood - if you're looking for a Hollywood experience - this is THE place to stay. Also within 10 minutes of Universal Studios - which drove much of our decision to stay/try The Roosevelt - it's the nicest hotel this close to Universal.  The Roosevelt is a Hollywood classic - it's super clean, super modern, but still retains it's old Hollywood Charm (and I don't mean charm or retro like lip-stick on a pig - but more like truly stepping back in time).  And while many classics rest on their laurels, the staff @ Roosevelt really step it up - from valet, to front desk, to housekeeping, and bars & restaurants - everyone is super friendly and extremely accommodating. Room quality - furnishings, bedding, cleanliness, etc. all A+.  And there's a crazy cool vibe all the time - with a great lobby bar, popular restaurants, wedding's going on, etc.  Quick example of good vibe - on Friday night they projected the Olympic Opening Ceremony on a massive screen in the lobby - tons of guests watching, hanging out, having drinks & deserts - great scene.  We were on a real quick family trip (with an 8-year old), so unfortunately didn't get to hang in any of the night-time bars or the pool - but I can bet those are a cool scene too.  This being said, I would not hesitate to stay here with kids - yea it's a trendy adult-oriented hotel, but plenty of kids around - and nothing of concern.  Of any criticism, I would say the bathrooms are small - clean & high quality fixtures - but small.  We had a king suite - fairly large with a separate bedroom, living room with large pull-out couch, and dining room - a great room - but even still the bathroom was small.  But a small compromise for all the other positives that the Hollywood Roosevelt delivers.  Highly recommend this high-quality hotel for an in-town Hollywood Experience.",King Suite - Awesome Room - Spacious with Great Views of Chinese Theater,5.0,5.0,,5.0,,,Bre S,Director of Guest Relations,2016-08-18,"TJP-Scottsdale,

Brent H,97,"Goldsboro, North Carolina",2016-07-31,FAMILY,2016-08-07,5,1st Vacation to Los Angeles ,"I love old hotels and history. When visiting LA my family wanted to stay at the historic Hollywood Roosevelt. The room we stayed in was 506. We stayed in a double queen  room and the mattresses was very comfortable. The room area was spacious enough for a family of 4 that included a 15 yr old son and a 12 yr old daughter. The TV was hung on the wall and the HD quality was awesome. The bathroom was nice and the shower pressure was nice. Air conditioning was very good. The room offered snacks and a wet bar however the snacks and drinks were very expensive. Offered amenities like a robe, earplugs, condoms. Hard to explain to kids what the condoms were for. Lol.  The bar area downstairs was quaint and dimly lit for comfort and anonymity. The hotel had a restaurant that my family did not use. The pool area was nice and secure. You needed a wristband from the front desk to get into the pool. Had a host checking wristbands. You needed your room key to operate the elevator to the floor you are staying on for safety. The Staff was very helpful and the bell hops and door men were polite and quick to help. Hollywood Roosevelt is in the middle of Hollywood Blvd. There was a CVS close by for snacks, drinks and other items you might have left home. Local restaurants were up and down the boulevard.  Across the road from the Chinese Theatre, Dolby Theater and Wax Museum. When we stayed in Hollywood Roosevelt I could imagine old Hollywood. The Oscars were held here and also Shirley Temple learned to tap dance on the steps of the hotel. Really Really nice!",,,,,,,,Bre S,Director of Guest Relations,2016-08-18,"Brent,

Ero40,263,,2015-11-30,FRIENDS,2016-08-06,2,A bit disappointing,"I was looking forward to staying her because of the history of the hotel.  I was very disappointed  to see the room we had was probably the smallest room I've ever stayed  in. Given that this hotel I always thought was meant to be grand I found it very overrated. The room was so basic that you didn't even have toiletries in the bathroom rather a generic bottle used for multiple guest. No internet in the rooms unless you pay. You have to go down to the lobby area and this is where I had the main issue. They were filming something in the hotel and there were people everywhere for what looked like a casting call. I walked out of the lifts to find people everywhere,  I had to push my way through to get out. Later in the evening they were trying to get up the lift to the floors with no swipe card. I didn't feel safe. I would have thought security would have been around. As there was no where in the lobby for me to sit and people in other spots in the hotel, I went I to the big bar area which is where you really see the Hollywood glamour in the decor, of the golden Hollywood days. My issue here was that non hotel guests were walking in and out and some were approaching guests and to be honest I have never felt so unsafe in a hotel. My issue is that given the Hollywood location is becoming more seedy these days then there should be some security.
The next morning I walked out of the lift to see last nights room service plates in the exit to the lobby area and still more people there for the casting call. 

The next day we were travelling to Vegas and wanted to see if we could leave a bag at the hotel. We were happy to pay an amount, but had done this in other hotels in the past with no issues. The staff member was great and said this would not be a problem at all. Next morning when we went to leave our bag it was a problem, we were told that they weren't sure if they would do it. After a while they agreed. 

On a good note the pool area is amazing, lovely location and since staying here I've been excited to see afterparties for the award shows and movie premieres host here, makes you realise that it is somewhere special to stay. They serve coffee by the pool in the mornings. It's a beautiful location.

The location is excellent if you want or need to be near the heart of Hollywood or the theatres. If you're going to the jimmy Kimmel show it's a perfect location. 
I have to acknowledge that the reception staff were very helpful when I was asking a question about a location I was going to. 

I'll probably staff here again for the right price but I certainly wouldn't pay high prices given the last experience I had.",,2.0,2.0,,,,2.0,,,,,103

From our amazingly spacious room (on the quite serene 9th floor) to the birthday and anniversary treats that greeted us upon check-in - we were treated like Hollywood Royalty by the friendly and efficient staff.

Don't miss a visit to the Spare Room bar (appropriate attire required) or the double burger by the Tropicana pool.  Yes, you are within walking distance or a quick cap to all the fun - but just people watching by the pool was entertainment enough.  And if only they sold the playlist of music that serenades you as you lounge poolside!

The employees here are so friendly, too. I love the Tropicana Bar and the smaller adjacent Garden Bar. It's exciting when there is a party on the weekends or even the night swimming parties are great too. Drinks and food can get a bit pricey, but the atmosphere is always fun.

The hotel is in the thick of Hollywood so there was lots to do within walking distance, wear comfortable shoes.  The front desk is actually in what seems like the back of the hotel.  I told them prior to arriving that it was Mario's birthday.  When we arrived the gave us a complimentary room upgrade.  We had a very spacious room facing away from the busy street.  There really aren't any views because of the location so we mostly had a parking lot view, no complaints-it was quiet.  I should mention that I had an amazing burger from 25 Degrees, the restaurant in the hotel.  Huge, juicy, blue cheese, fresh brioche bun...ah, want one now!  We had drinks poolside at 2:00am.  It was fun to be able to continue on at the Tropicana bar at that hour, mellow vibe & good music.

Anita S,30,,2015-08-31,SOLO,2016-07-30,5,"Excellent location, close to everything","I stayed Juky last year so his review is a little late. 

I had a king room and it was tiny (32sqm). I was travelling solo so it was ok for one person. I think it would be too cosy for 2 people. The bed was heavenly and so comfortable. There was a big tv with all the channels which was great. The bathroom , while modern and clean, wAs tiny. I could stretch my arms and touch the front wall and back wall. 

It was a good base to see Hollywood as it is close to everything. I didn't use the pool as I was too busy exploring everyday. It's a safe hotel and has a really nice sitting area / bar downstairs. 

It could be noisy at night because you are right on the Main Street. 

Unfortunately on my last night I had a do not disturb sign on my door and some kids (teenagers) thought it would be funny to knock on my door in the early hours of the morning. I told the girl upon checkout but she didn't seem too nonplussed. I guess it's the type of hotel that attracts kids to Hollywood for a fun night out but they were lucky I wasn't an angry 6 foot 3 psycho 😳

At the checkout there was a charge on my room from the mini bar for something I didn't use but it was rectified.  I booked a super shuttle to lax and it was late turning up so the guy at the front desk called them for me to find out what was happening even though it was busy at the desk. As I waited outside he he came out to tell me what had happened with the shuttle. This was really good customer service.

Mwellaby,187,"Vancouver, Canada",2016-07-31,BUSINESS,2016-07-26,3,Truly an overpriced 3 star hotel and experience,"I have to say my trip started out on the wrong foot with them putting me on a lower floor versus the quiet higher floor I requested. View of ventilation shafts wasn't exciting either.

Check in process was smooth as they wouldn't give me the room I requested and had no choices. Expensive King suite upper floor! 😡 definitely way overpriced!

This is definitely not a hotel for a family trip, avoid his hotel if it's a family stay you're looking for, this is definitely a party scene hotel and music and noise till at least 2am. Great for a party or stag.

The rooms say they are renovated, but not sure which year, as they definitely need to be updated sooner than later and washroom is ridiculously small and tight if you are with a spouse or girlfriend they won't work!

The TV is so far away from the bed you would need binoculars to watch a movie.

As well, it's says non smoking hotel, but definitely not the case at all! Hallway smelled of marijuana each day and night on our floor!! And I mean seriously smelled so much I thought I might get high. 

The pool is poorly run and management shakes you down for a chair by the pool. They said you can't reserve a seat but yet every morning I showed up all seats were reserved despite the pool being empty (partyers can't wake up before noon). You have to be forceful to get a seat by the pool, which is why I went there and paid big bucks in the first place. Also many locals have deals with staff and reserve loungers and make hotel guests put on waiting lists all the time. Completely unprofessional and unacceptable for the money I paid! 

Food service was horrible the first day and even getting a menu was a big challenge, but got better when the weekend crew showed up and an amazing Australian named Miranda knew how to hustle and serve in a timely manner. Food is good as well and so were the drinks.

There was never a concierge on duty, however front desk staff were awesome and made good suggestions and reservations and arrangements, kudos for that! Also front desk Manager Marlon was very helpful to make up for any issues encountered previously.

Pool is clean and well maintained.

I wouldn't recommend this hotel, especially for the price it was very bad value and overall the hotel is not in good shape. 

Fun place to party if you can pay off pool boys to give you a lounger amongst all the empty ""reserved"" loungers, that was a complete disappointment and sham. ",,,,,,,,Sebastian K,Front Office Manager,2016-08-29,"mwellaby,

Thank you for taking the time to share your experience. We wish it had not been such a up and down experience for you. The hotel was renovated in 2015 and while there are certain challenges with renovating a historic building (certain rooms do have smaller than expect bathrooms, but we have plenty of room options to balance it out) we are proud of the room product. We wish you come back and join us on a future stay and we will be sure to impress you with the room experience. Throughout the summer we do host promoted pool parties on the weekends and accommodate all guests as best we can, with weekdays and the morning into the early afternoon being hotel guest preferred.

PMMNewYork,47,"London, United Kingdom",2016-07-31,FAMILY,2016-07-25,4,Great but busy & loud stay in the heart of Hollywood,"The hotel is full of history and has a wonderful old-school Hollywood vibe.  It is located right on busy Hollywood Blvd. across from the Chinese Theatre & the Dolby Theatre. The hotel pool is huge and lovely. Although Booking.com recommends a deluxe room with two Queen beds for a family of 4, the room was far too small for the 4 of us.  The staff takes the show as they are all very helpful and lovely.  The valet staff, bell staff and the front desk staff are all incredibly helpful, welcoming and professional.  We complained about the noise outside our bedroom as people were congregating by the elevators/lifts and they changed our room. 

Be aware that the hotel pool hosts parties and other events, so the vibe of the hotel changes dramatically once the party attendees arrive. If you're there to enjoy a party scene, then its perfect.  If you want your hotel to be a place to relax once you get back from a busy day of sight-seeing, this hotel may not be ideal.  This area of Hollywood looks quite tired and abandoned during the day and is incredibly busy in the evening.  It like staying in the middle of times square or piccadilly circus.

Justine in Guest Relations treated us to a room upgrade and some goodies as it is my Mum's birthday. She also organised and made the necessary reservations for tours around LA.
Other reception staff are polite and helpful.
Our room view is not great but as it is the back of the hotel it is quiet and there is no traffic or party noise whilst we sleep.
We have 2 extremely comfortable double beds. The aircon is great and effective. The bathroom is small and yet still has a bath tub which I am pleased about as I prefer baths to showers. 
There is free safety deposit box, iron and board with plenty of drawers and hanging space.
The tv has a number of channels - news, sport, dramas, comedy etc.
There is complimentary wifi in the lobby.
I look forward to using the inviting pool later in the week.
The best thing about the hotel for me is the location - Hop On Hop Off bus immediately outside, dozens of restaurants and coffee shops all around, CVS for groceries and other essentials, many major attractions on your doorstep.

Debcmann,2,"Davis, California",2016-07-31,NONE,2016-07-18,2,WISH I HAD LOVED IT,"We stayed here for three nights.  We had two double beds for my two teenage girls, my husband and me.  The beds were literally the best thing about this hotel.  They were phenomenally comfortable.  The pillows too were amazing.  We all slept so so well despite the small beds.  We had a large room with a view of the Hollywood sign and Hollywood boulevard.  The fridge was stocked full of every drink anyone could want.  However, a small bottle of water would set you back $10 dollars.
The bathroom was just weird.  The toilet was the first thing one encountered upon entering and there was no lock on the door.  It was awkward and quite strange.  The shower was huge but the water pressure was completely inadequate.  It took what seemed like forever to get the shampoo rinsed out of my hair.
The room was quite nice and very clean.  There was a desk and couch and upholstered chair.  The beds though had wooden frame which protruded at the foot of the bed.  My daughter and I both stubbed our toes and hit our shins against them because of how much they protrude past the foot of the bed.
I would say that all staff we encountered were very accommodating, especially the guys who tended to the cars and luggage. 
The hotel itself is quite something to see.  There is obviously a lot of history there and the architecture is quite impressive.
Now for the not so good.  I was very surprised at the clientele at this hotel given the high price of rooms.  There were several times when my daughters and I were in an elevator with folks I would venture to guess made a living dealing drugs.  I would not allow my 17 and 15 year old to take the elevator alone which is something I would not ordinarily have a problem with.  The same kind of guest could be found anywhere in the hotel, especially the pool area.
On the one occasion that we actually had time to visit the pool and take a swim, there was a HUGE  party taking place.  The music was so loud I could not converse with my husband.  And once again, the clientele were less than desirable  Most were intoxicated and scantly clad.  I was shocked and so glad that my daughters were not with us at that time.  How was a hotel guest expected to enjoy the pool with this kind of despicable party taking place???
We were told by hotel personelle that the party was nearly over.  When we returned some time later with my daughters to swim, the pool was closed.  Apparently they close it down at 7pm which seems very early for a summers evening.  It doesn't even get dark here until close to 9
For the $400 dollars a night I certainly expected a much more classy hotel.  Its a shame they have allowed it to decline so sharply.  On our last night there we returned to our room via the elevator which reeked of marijuana. Perhaps a change in management could bring this beautiful hotel back to what is should be.  But as it stands now, I would certainly not return.",,,,,,,,Sebastian K,Front Office Manager,2016-07-24,"Debcmann,
Thank you for taking the time to leave this review. Learning how we can better improve our guest experience is invaluable to us. While I am thrilled that you enjoyed the beds so much, and were comfortable while you were here, there are clearly some inconveniences that you experienced during your time with us, and for that I sincerely apologize.

I am happy to hear that you enjoyed the history embodied in our architecture and décor, but I apologize for the impracticality which came along with it. We are a historic property, so many of our rooms differ in size, shape, and location within the building. Each bedroom, bathroom, and closet are shaped differently, and if the shape of your bathroom was not up to par for you, again I apologize. I’m sure there is a room that has the perfect bathroom for you and your family, but it does not sound like that is the room we gave you, which is something that I will look into planning better with my staff.

Our hotel has always been known for it’s nightlife and pool parties, more so over the summer than any other season. While we do our best to accommodate our guests before anyone else, we do understand that the parties are not everybody’s cup of tea, and we do what we can to make up for any inconveniences in other ways. 

I understand that you did not feel that your time with us was worth the money you spent to be here, and that is the very opposite of how we hope our guests leave here feeling. I am confident that we can make it up to you should you choose to stay with us again, but I am completely understanding if that is no longer an option. If it is, please reach out to the hotel and ask for me directly, I would be more than happy to help you plan your next stay so that you are in the right room, with the right bathroom, at the right price, on the right weekend for you and your family.

Sksksksksksk,3,"Nagoya, Japan",2016-07-31,COUPLES,2016-07-18,5,Amazing guest relations,"The hotel is charming with an amazing historic lobby and beautifully and interestingly renovated rooms.  And it is perfectly located for our needs, being just 1 mile from the Hollywood Bowl.  But what really made our stay was the extra effort of the guest relations staff.  I called and asked for some help with dinner reservations, and they took that request and went above and beyond, finding us a perfect dinner spot but also setting us up with a beautiful suite and some special treats to help make my husband's birthday celebration special. And then kept in contact with me over the next few days before and during our stay to make sure everything went well!  I've never seen anything quite like it!  A special thanks to Bre and Allyson for making our stay just perfect.",,,5.0,,5.0,5.0,,Bre S,Director of Guest Relations,2016-08-04,"Sksksksksksk,

AnotherUnitedKingdom,208,"London, United Kingdom",2016-07-31,BUSINESS,2016-07-18,3,Boutique Tower Of Terror?,"Was supposed to stay here for 2 whole weeks, managed only 1. This is not a business hotel or a resort hotel for that matter IMHO. You’re staying here to hang out by the pool or be central to the hotspots of Hollywood. It’s essentially a place to be seen, have industry events, parties or all of those at the same time. It’s dated, retro and a little battered around the edges.
Check in was a little chaotic (lots of stairs in the reception area) as the girl on the desk struggled with calls, other employees etc. Positives; the rooms have been refurbed. They’re modern urban décor is fine (grey walls, huge bed, armchair, rolling doors). But they are randomly sized – so be specific at check in. I moved rooms, asked for bigger but got given smaller, higher and quieter! So gave up. Didn’t have a tub in either room (LA has no water!) and there’s little counter space in the bathrooms but otherwise clean and modern. Bed was comfy. Big desk with integrated powerpoints. Noisy aircon in one room. But whisper quiet in the second. But they have opening windows so you have options! Used the laundry – excellent. Didn’t try room service. Used the fitness room – which has squeaky and antiquated cross trainers and one weights bench. 
Negatives; the entire place preserves it’s Hollywood glamour schtick by being super gloomy and DARK. The lobby is essentially a public space right off Hollywood Boulevard with limited hotel staff and small bar. But pitch black. With numerous walk ins taking pictures and leaving .Actually overheard one group abandon a meeting as they couldn’t see anything. Everywhere else is dark too. The whole vibe is akin to Disney’s Tower Of Terror. The elevators have keycard security but once one person has tapped a button – all other floors are accessible. Not great 
The pool is not a super relaxing place to sunbathe either – think dated Motel. Bar service was good. Food ok. Drinks strong. But the place closed randomly every night for events (it’s heavy on the industry/premiere action here). Some of these are LOUD. There are earplugs in the rooms. Never a good sign. If you have a cabana room – good luck, get some Bose headphones! The ‘Spare Room’ upstairs in the lobby has a bowling lane and great décor. But it’s loud (the balls slamming the wood!) and the theme night we wandered into was weird (horrid cocktails too). Kudos to the staff who calmly escorted a drunk girl out and looked after her on the hall floor.
Can’t actually fault the place on amenities but I can’t recall a hotel where I have felt ill at ease/uncomfortable in public spaces and not been able to find a quiet corner to have a call or meeting. 
Location – it’s prime for the tourist sites and 10-15mins from Studio City, 20 from the beach (use Ubers! NOT cabs). But it’s essentially Times Square with added palm trees. There’s an IHop and In&Out round the back if you want some easy cheap eats. Otherwise there’s a CVS across the street (very handy) and the H&H centre and the strip are close by but everything seemed to be shady/crazy busy or close by 10pm.","Go higher, ask how big the room is!",,3.0,,,3.0,4.0,Sebastian K,Front Office Manager,2016-08-29,"AnotherUnitedKingdom,

Mathew L L,14,,2016-06-30,SOLO,2016-07-15,5,Can't wait to go back!,"I recently got back from staying ten nights at the Roosevelt and had such a great time. I was staying in Los Angeles on my own and my whole experience made the Roosevelt feel like home. 

I had such a warm welcome from Richard and had been given an upgrade to a king room. The room was great; modern, big, bright, clean with a huge comfy bed and walk in closet. I had a view from the 12th floor of the walk of fame and Hollywood sign where I could see all the premieres that were going on. 

The staff were all really helpful, especially Javier who I had being emailing prior to arrival and who took the time to slip a free shake voucher under my door one night as a kind welcome gesture. The air conditioning in my room froze and broke, however by the time I had returned to my room the leak had been cleaned, reception and maintenance had been informed and had begun to fix it and an alternative room (which wasn't needed) had already been arranged in case I wanted to move before I even knew it had broken. The customear service is brilliant! 

The rest of the hotel is beautiful, I didn't get chance to have a pool day but the pool area looked comfortable and relaxing. The location couldn't be better either, being across the road from such major landmarks and the main tours and tour buses with various taxi ranks too. 

I had breakfast most mornings in the 25 Degrees restaurant which was reasonably priced and delicious with a varied menu. I always had a warm welcome. 

The only criticisms I could find were that my room got a little dusty during my stay as I was there 10 nights and the Lounge was quite overpriced. The Tropicana charged $21 for a mojito which I thought was a little steep, especially when you can get a nicer one at the Hard Rock Cafe across the road for about $14. The water pressure in my room was also a bit poor, however this wasn't really a problem and I put it down to the fact that I was on the highest floor and it is an old building. 

I would recommend this hotel to anybody! Excellent customer service, clean, modern and comfortable rooms and in a brilliant location. Its not far from the airport either; I took a Super Shuttle which cost me around $30 round trip. I will definitely be staying here again the next time I visit Los Angeles!",,,5.0,5.0,,,4.0,Bre S,Director of Guest Relations,2016-08-04,"Matthew,

Matt S,20,"Lisbon, Portugal",2016-07-31,BUSINESS,2016-07-14,4,$25 Dollar Coffee? Insane!,"Really like the Hollywood Roosevelt. It's an icon which has withstood the test of time and the architecture and scenery (the pool in particular) is tops. Rooms are always nice and clean and they routinely upgrade if available. But this AM I arose early and didn't feel like walking around the corner to get coffee. So I called room service. Pot of coffee and some skim milk. No food. Not a banana. Not a muffin. Not a poached egg or piece of toast. Nothing. Just a pot of coffee, which as with all hotel coffee is that mediocre Bunn or equivalent brand/flavor -- nothing to write home about but good old fashioned high test coffee to get the motor running. The charge was $25. I shook my head and laughed and the poor room service delivery guy was just embarrassed at the outrage. $25 for coffee. Wow. 

So by all means stay at this very good hotel, but walk around the corner for coffee and save yourself $20 plus some.

Abe D,3,"Boston, Massachusetts",2016-06-30,BUSINESS,2016-07-13,5,Hollywood Roosevelt is Amazing,"2nd time staying at this historic hotel and they gave me the same corner room (217) as last year.  This made me so comfortable after a 6 hour flight and being so far from home. 

The staff was amazing, everyone from Sebastian who secured our bags when we were trying to locate a nearby venue for a client event, to Justine who left us fruit and water because she knew that work business trips tend to be long nights of indulging on rich, delicious food. And Bre was the best! She wrote a spectacularly crafted handwritten note with a round of drinks attached that was happily accepted at any of the restaurants on the premises.

I was able to order room service by the pool and move to a table with no problem so that I could join a friend who was visiting.  And I still can't believe how warm the water was I got in the pool. I am not used to that, being from the east. Haha!

They were shooting Showtime's ""Roadies"" during our stay and the staff was very informative and upfront about them invading the lobby. It was cool to see because it brought me back to my days of being on a set and it was a bonus perk to have it so close to our stay. We even met some of the cast who were absolutely friendly.

GypsyLovingSoul,133,,2016-06-30,FAMILY,2016-07-13,5,3nights - Location Location Location,"Ok so I will start off with the bad points first 

We arrived to the hotel a little before 3PM after a long day of travelling to find out our room wasn't ready. We had requested a Studio Double as their was 3 adults staying in the room. I was told they only have 5 of this room type and they could give us a King with a rollaway or downgrade us if we wanted to check in then and there. Of course there was no way I was taking a downgrade or having a King with a rollaway after booking and paying months in advance for a Studio Double. When I was asked how long it was going to be I got ""I don't know"". So we were given vouchers to have a drink while we waited and would be given breakfast for the following morning. We didn't end up getting our keys till 5:30 - not impressed at all especially with the limited time we had in LA. We also couldn't enjoy the pool area as it was full of non-hotel guests enjoying a DJ they put on over the weekend. We were then also informed Disney had booked out the entire pool area 1 day while we were there so the pool couldn't be used then either. 

I had also requested a late check-out as our flight wasn't till 10PM at night & was informed the latest would be 2PM. I asked again during our stay if there was any chance to pay a little bit extra so we could relax & refresh before heading to the Airport. I was told no and we now needed to be checked out by 1PM due to filming, which I advised no I wouldn't be checking out till 2 as advised at check-in. After checking out of our room, I went out shopping while family stayed behind. Turns out the room was available & my family were able to go back up and stay in the room till 5:30pm. Not happy with being lied to by a certain staff member. 

Good Points - Room was huge & amazing - the beds little small for 2 adults, they should of put 2 queens in the room. Bathroom amenities are gorgeous. Studio Double has 2 bathrooms which is a fantastic bonus.

ericaa28,43,,2016-06-30,NONE,2016-07-05,4,Nice place..,"We stayed here from 6/27-7/1. We had the double deluxe room and it was quote spacious.  Our room faced the left side of the walk of fame, which was cool, you could see every store you may or may not need right from the window.( CVS, Subway, Pizza,Tours). The room had 2 flat screen TV mounted, a desk & a table area with a couch and chair. What I did learn from the previous reviews was there would be no dressers- crazy right?  But it really wasn't.  Instead they had these cubby things in the closet where you could store your clothes- whatever we didn't hang, we put in the cubby.
The shower was to die FOR! It was a huge walk in shower with 2 shower heads- you just wanted to live in there. Also due to the size of the room, it had 2 thermostats which was cool, as we literally kept one side of the room cooler than the other. Check in was seamless, my husband and son visited the heated pool and loved it.  We ordered room service one night- no issues there. Upon check in we received a 25$ food and bev credit which we applied to the room svc order. 2 things I didn't like-  1) they charge daily for parking- which was silly to me, I mean where else would we park for 4 days, although you could come and go as you pleased- its just an added cost that didn't need to happen- IMO.  2) not enough mirrors or vanity space.- I'm not vain by any means (smiling) but usually there are 2 vanity areas, so at least if someone is in the shower, you can do your makeup else where and not hog the bathroom. Other than that, The lobby is gorgeous, very "" old Hollywood"" the room was spacious, loved the farm doors that closed off the bathroom area, and  room door, and loved the 2 TV's. The location is exquisite if you are doing all things LA- very centrally located, right on the walk of fame.  While there we did Disneyland, Universal Hollywood VIP tour, Legoland Hotel & park and visited a friend in Bev Hills.- of all those places, Legoland was the farthest, and Universal was the closest, but still centrally located to say the least. Would I stay here again YES, does the charge for parking suck yes, but it was still a great time.",,,,,,,,Bre S,Director of Guest Relations,2016-07-15,"Erica,

I'm sorry about the charge for parking, it is a business decision, and we do everything we can to keep the price down for our guests.  I hope we are able to see you again soon.

It is right on the Walk of Fame and very close to a lot of tourist attractions. The grounds for the hotel are amazing and the pool and various nightclubs are a lot of fun. I know everything in LA is expensive, but this hotel could really work on its prices. I paid a good amount of money for a hotel room, only to arrive and be put in a box facing a wall.

So much so, that when I ran out I emailed the hotel as I couldn't find a supplier in Australia and wanted contact details of the supplier so I could contact them directly. Unfortunately the hotel,was unable to give me those details but very kindly have offered to send me some of the product! What an excellent outcome! It just goes to show that some hotels continue to care for their guests - even a year on!

Lynn B,47,"Cornwall, United Kingdom",2016-07-31,FAMILY,2016-07-02,4,In the centre of Hollywood ,"Staff here go the extra mile for their guests , everyone is so friendly, Shaun who showed us to the room and brought our luggage was really informative , we were tired as had arrived in from UK and he sorted us a dinner reservation and a tour for the next day. Really helpful. If you are looking for a modern hotel with those amenities that come as standard in a newer hotel , then this is probably not for you, it's has and old and traditional feel about it , with a small pool, which I have to say is managed superbly , a pool attendant seats you and so there fore there are no annoying towels left on sunbeds that are not being  used. Leaving plenty of seats available what ever time you arrive. Pool bar and food service was also very good with a lovely atmosphere , they do let non guests in, and it seems to be a popular hang out for any wannabe in LaLa land which may be a little off outing to regular guests just wanting to unwind at the pool. It was interesting to watch to say the least!!! Rooms are okay , beds are very comfy but unusually windows are whited so you can't see out , light comes through but I would prefer to see what ever may be out there if I am honest. Bathrooms are small but again remembering this is an iconic hotel 100 years old I guess this reflects its era. But I would suggest some bathroom hooks to hang wet towels etc would be a good addition. It's a bustling place with a party feel , I can't say that made a difference to our stay and there was no noise coming into the rooms and we were on a low floor. The 25 degrees restaurant serves the most awesome burgers and your should defiantly try one of you are staying here! 
I would of liked tea and coffee facilities in the room, rather than the Endless branded goods and water at $6 a bottle!  Found the addition of male contraception on the tray to purchase amusing ! 
The two bedded rooms are not suitable in my opinion for more than 2 adults to share , maybe one child could share with an adult but the beds  are small and we were traveling and three adults so in fact booked another room once we saw the size of the beds. Probably 4ft wide in uk we would say it's a small double at best. Reception were very helpful at sorting this. We purchased the wifi which has been really reliable, we give this for free in our hotel in the U.K. However I would rather pay $15 a day then not have it at all! 
The hotel is a great location right in the middle of the strip, you can walk to many restaurants , shops and amusements , pick ups are easy for yours etc. I used erc car service while we were here for private tours and would defiantly recommend them as an alternative to the main stream tours and taxis. 
All in all a varied but very enjoyable stay in Hollywood , I would probably return here but I think at my age now I may look to stay further out at Santa Monica or Beverly Hills and visit into Hollywood. ",,,,,,,,Bre S,Director of Guest Relations,2016-07-15,"Lynn,

It is a place to see and be seen, but unlike many 'hip' hotels, this is a reputation carried since the first Academy Awards was held in its banquet halls and Ms. Monroe was captured lounging poolside.  Located on Hollywood Boulevard, it is central to most theaters, clubs and upscale dining offered in Hollywood.  The hotel itself is a testament to old Hollywood style with striking Spanish Colonial architecture, elegant, over-sized conversation areas and low lighting invites nostalgia for Hollywood's Golden Era.  Poolside rooms are contemporary in style and look out to the lush palm-lined Tropicana pool, a true sanctuary to the boulevard beyond the hotel.  A lively day and night scene is available weekends at Tropicana Pool/Bar with hotel guests receiving priority of coveted poolside seating.","If you are staying for the weekend/night scene, choose a poolside room.

minkycee,51,"Los Angeles, California",2016-06-30,BUSINESS,2016-06-28,5,Exceeded expectations,"When I lived in LA, I avoided the Hollywood/Highland area due to the crowds and traffic. I ended up at The Roosevelt for 4 nights for business and it exceeded my expectations.

Check-in was swift, luggage arrived to my room quickly, the junior suite was spacious and well-appointed with an unusually large bathroom. During my stay there, the service was excellent. And frankly, I was surprised. As a historic property in the middle of a tourist-heavy area, the staff don't necessarily have to be service-oriented -- the hotel would have great business anyway, is what I thought. But everyone from the bellman to the housekeeper to the valets were friendly, quick to offer assistance and to inquire about our stay. Especially the valets. The friendliness of the valets somewhat offsets the painfully expensive $42 (plus tax) overnight parking fee.
Special thanks to Mike B. and Rocko for being helpful with their suggestions and friendly to my son.

Let's go over the basics: There's not a better location if you're trying to stay in Hollywood.  You're steps away from TCL, Hollywood & Highland (and it's Metro station), El Capitan, with dining and nightlife options all around.  

Check in was a breeze, and I was pleasantly surprised when the desk agent recognized me walking up and greeted me by name. I'm not sure if the hotel utilizes a loyalty program, keeps track of who stays when, or (my guess) makes a conscious effort to give every guest a Hollywood experience, but when I got to my room (809) I found this spacious, modernly appointed space with plenty of room to move and an unbeatable view of Hollywood Blvd.  On the desk, light refreshments and a hand written note from Bre Smith, the hotel's Director of Guest Services.

IngridHA1973,321,"Coral Gables, Florida",2016-06-30,FAMILY,2016-06-23,4,The best location in Hollywood!,"It will all based on what are your plans during your visit to the city.  We stayed two times before, always in the Hollywood area and we wouldn't pick any other area for the entertainment of it. Firs time we stayed and the Luxe Hotel and the second time at the Lowes Hotel.  I have always watched the Roosevelt from afar and always wanted to stay here.  This was our time. A lot of perseverance and patience looking for the best prices, gave us the opportunity this time. When you look into the hotels you have to always calculate not only the prices, the taxes, any extras such as parking and breakfast.  And then the reviews, of course.
There are no bad reviews of the hotel other than the noise for the pool parties and pool complains in general.  And they are true to an extent.
The valet parking is $42 per night and there are not self parking options at the hotel, but there is one parking right across the street over Orange St ($20 overnight but not in and out privileges) and there is another one 2 blocks away for $15 overnight, no in/out.  But honestly nothing beat the location of this hotel. If you are planning to go to Rodeo Drive, Beverly Hills, the Hollywood Sign, etc etc...you will need a car and driving on pick rush hour (or any other time - it is always rush time in LA) it is a nightmare. It can take you 1 hour to drive 5 miles.  So nights are better spend on Hollywood with so many movie theaters, museums, shopping, nightlife...so many opportunities to see famous people on movie premiers, etc.
The hotel has a different event daily: either a party by the pool, a wedding, a movie been filmed at the lobby...hey...it is hollywood after all...but we love it.
It is glamour and old fashioned Hollywood.
The check in was around noon and moved to two beds for 2 adults and one kid with no extra charge.  Sebastian at the front desk was informative and very pleasant to deal with. Thank you Sebastian! No surprises and all at the table from the beginning.  I would have loved to have a room with a view but I didn't request one, so no complaints.  The rooms with two beds are full size and those are kind of small for two persons (even my young daughter and skinny me), something to think about for next time.  I read rave reviews about the pool cabanas but couldn't afford one.
The rooms are simple but modern and very well maintained. The beds are like clouds and very easy to fall asleep into (regardless the size).
I found no coffee at the lobby as mentioned on some reviews and we were early birds, so I really don't know where there was offered.  I knew about the pool scene on the weekends, then it didn't bother me at all and first two days were for sightseeing, no time for the pool.  The second day we went to the pool around 2.30pm and there was a reservation list for the chair/beds around the pool. It seems to be that they allow people that are not staying at the hotel in the pool area, and we ended up waiting over two hours sitting on the hot stone by the pool - when every single chair was rapidly occupied by the people next to it (without respecting any waiting list) and frustrated I directed my concern to the hostess, we finally got one chair for the three of us.  We ordered some finger foods at the bar, which tasted AMAZING, some drinks...and finally relax by the pool.  Next morning (Tuesday) I decided to be smarter and I woke up at 9am and went straight to the pool (again, I saw no complimentary coffee anywhere).  This time there were some chairs available (like 10%) so I picked one and started relaxing...We spent almost all day by the pool and that is - as I read in another review - an Oasis in the back of the hotel...another world, excellent...
They gave us a late check out, much appreciated due to our 9.30PM flight and we enjoyed every last second of it.

RUIWEN78,110,"Singapore, Singapore",2016-06-30,COUPLES,2016-06-23,3,"Great Location, Historic Venue yet Underwhelmed","First of all, we got a welcome email from the manager before we arrived which was nice. He said ""Should you require assistance to plan anything while you are staying with us, please email us at reservations@thehollywoodroosevelt.com."" I emailed to ask a couple of questions and did not get a reply at all...even when I checked in. If they did not mean it, they should not offer it. We were staying for a night only as we were flying into LA after a 10 hour flight and we wanted to break our onward journey to Vegas. My partner is a huge film buff and I thought it would be nice to stay in such a historic hotel for our wedding anniversary. The hotel building was nice and the historic spaces was fun to check out but we did not have to be guests to access those areas. The location is the best thing for us as it's literally a stone's throw from the main Hollywood attractions. We had the queen superior room which was nicely furnished. We appreciated the roomy closet for our suitcases. For the price of the room, we expected amenities like toothbrushes & toothpaste which was not available. In this day and age, $15 for a day of wifi is also very steep - although free wifi is available in the lobby. Again, for the price of the room, you would think that wifi would be complimentary. It's a nice hotel and we enjoyed our short stay. We would have given a higher rating if it was more value for money. Good for the novelty and we encourage others to try it for that but it wouldn't be our choice again if we came back to LA.",,,3.0,4.0,,,4.0,,,,,70

Debbie_28_60,51,"Wollongong, Australia",2016-06-30,FAMILY,2016-06-22,5,Great location and vibe!,"I recently stayed at the Roosevelt with my adult daughter for 4 nights at the conclusion of our road trip down the west coast of America and could not be happier. 
The welcome we received and assistance from the valets, we've never used a valet before and the front desk was outstanding. Everyone was extremely helpful and friendly. 
Our room was on the 3rd floor and facing the Chinese theatre, which meant even on Saturday night our room was quiet. 
On Saturday we visited the pool area and Derek was very friendly and arranged lounges for us and the wait staff were very friendly and attentive. 
The location meant we could walk to most places or it was a short Uber ride to a few of the restaurants we wanted to visit. Even Disneyland and Universal were  reasonable drives away. 
On our final day the hotel was very busy with filming and a movie premier across the street but the staff were still very attentive to our needs. 
Overall we could not be happier with our stay and would definitely recommend and hopefully one day return. ",,,,,,,,Bre S,Director of Guest Relations,2016-06-24,"Debbie,

I stayed here with 2 girlfriends In deluxe room there was plenty of room for the 3 of us.  The pool area had a fun a vibe and we enjoyed our afternoon cocktails by the pool.

The food from the Tropicana bar was brilliant and great service.

From the moment you check in the staff and service is out of this world. Check in was easy and quick. Having problems with our previous accommodations, pulling up at The Hollywood Roosevelt was a great sigh of relief. After a hectic day we enjoyed a drink at the Spare Room and we ended our night there every night after. Bags were taken to the room promptly. The room and the washroom were very chic. Very comfortable beds and just the ambiance and the rich history of the hotel is perfect. Only one suggestion we had is to offer free WiFi to guests in the rooms. We were in town for LA Pride and the Tropicana Cafe as well as the pool is a must-see. We attended a pool party for Pride on one of the days and let me tell you, it doesn't get anymore LA then one of those pool parties.

June H,123,"Las Vegas, Nevada",2016-06-30,COUPLES,2016-06-20,4,Historic Hollywood,"First trip to Hollywood for a black tie wedding (offsite). Hotel offered discounted rate for wedding guests.  2 night stay.

Easy access off Hollywood Blvd. Upon arrival we discovered there is no self parking. Valet is $45/day.  Mildly inconvenient, long wait during peak times, we were almost late to our event. 

Hotel staff friendly. No wait at checkin. We had a king room on the 11th floor, offered an upgrade but we declined. Elevators functional with no long wait. 

This is a historic hotel so we weren't quite sure how ""historic."" We found the room well appointed and comfortable. Air conditioning struggled a bit at times. We had a view of downtown LA and could see the BLVD from our room.  

Bathroom did not lack amenities but rain shower head had minimal pressure. Half glass shower enclosure (no privacy) and no real ventilation meant getting ready one at a time.  There was a fridge in room but it's stocked by the hotel. 

We missed housekeeping after the first night; even after being away from the room for hours, no one came by or called, but we didn't request it either. 

The Walk of Fame is literally right outside the hotel, with the TLC Chinese Theatre right across the street. Ideal location. We did not utilize the pool or the restaurants. 

This is a gorgeous, upscale hotel. We really couldn't have picked a better place to stay for our first trip to Hollywood. Will stay again. ",,,,,,,,Bre S,Director of Guest Relations,2016-06-24,"June,

Thank you for taking the time to leave this fantastic, detailed review of our property. As you mentioned, we are a historic property, so many of our rooms differ in size and shape.

I would be happy to make sure your next stay with us is even more enjoyable than this past one, and that we get you out to the pool and some of our outlets.

I've been to many amazing hotels across the world and to experience such hospitality in my own backyard, LA, is pretty awesome.  It started with my greeting and check-in where I was upgraded to a King Suite.  It was a huge corner room, with a separate living/dining room with views of the Chinese Theater on Hollywood Blvd.  

I was there on a business trip and heard from a few of the women in my group that they were upgraded as well.  On so many of my business trips, I'm passed by for the perks, which I've noticed are often given to the men I'm traveling with.  I've never said anything, but I've taken note.  Kudos to the Hollywood Roosevelt for knowing the value of female travelers!!)

Unfortunately, on the first night there was a huge party going on (I think outside of the hotel) but I was unable to sleep.  The staff did everything they could to remedy it, including finding me a new room.  I want to especially thank Francis, the Front Desk Manager, for the nice note and free drink tickets under my door the next morning...classy!

Cobadii,35,"Tuggerah, Australia",2016-06-30,SOLO,2016-06-14,4,You feel important staying here ,"I'd been obsessed with the Roosevelt for years due to its rich Hollywood history so when I knew I would be in LA, I had to book it. It was the most expensive hotel I've ever stayed in. Due to this I thought they would include complimentary wifi, but it was $15 for 24hrs or $30 for 48hrs. This was a little disappointing. I arrived via an uber to the entrance on Hollywood Boulevard, there were workers packing down an event and I had no idea where I was going. I assumed there would be a bell hop or concierge to direct me to the front desk. I had to ask a bar man where to go. It ws very confusing at first. The check in staff were lovely. The room was SO much smaller than I imagined. When booking the room you're told the sq ft of the room but I had no idea what a 'foot' was so I was a little shocked. It didn't end up mattering anyway as I was hardly in the room. The bed was SO SO SO comfortable. The decor and bathroom was very modern. I had a drink at the spare room and the library. Super expensive but 2 of the best cocktails I'd ever had so happy to spend the money. A very unique experience that I'm glad I had. The staff were always lovely with any and all enquiries I had. The location is absolutely perfect. I would definitely stay here again if there was a good deal. ",,,,,,,,Bre S,Director of Guest Relations,2016-06-16,"Cobadii,

The history behind it is what drew me to this hotel and it did not disappoint in that respect. It was exactly as I had imagined it would be- dimly lit foyer and bar area, photos of past celebrity guests and the odd ghost story or two. 

Our room itself (1206) was the average size you would expect, but I did find the bathroom to be quite small.  The bed was comfortable and made for a good night's sleep. The hotel is located right on the main strip of Hollywood Boulevard, which made it a good base for exploring the main strip.

The Red Line metro station is just down the road and this takes you straight to Universal City, perfect for a day out at Universal Studios.

DLLu,11,"Melbourne, Australia",2016-06-30,COUPLES,2016-06-13,4,"Pool, bed, food, location","I was lucky to get an international deal online that reduce the room costs, however with the bad exchange rates between AUD & USD, it is still quite steep. I initially booked for 3 nights, had something came up and cancelled it to 2 nights but eventually needed to increase back to 3 but couldn't as my selected room type wasn't available and a one down type cost way more than a room at W hotel. 

What was amazing? 
The pool and the set up around the pool. The water is warm to step in which I like. Noted that not everyone would like that. Bar service is good. The food served is good too. It was similar to the room service menu which is equally good with healthy superfood options. Quality current trending foods that are healthy and delicious.

The bed is really comfy with 4 pillows and warm quilt. Good room temperature controls too. 

Location is good if you want to be situated near the Chinese theatre, some basic shopping and walk of fame. Unfortunately there isn't too many interesting food outlets/restaurants around the hotel. But the usual subways, and coffee bean(which I don't mind) is around the corner. With that said, the food in the hotel is amazing and so is the bar next to the lobby exit of the hotel.

Down side is that both nights I stayed had movie premieres and the lobby exit isn't accessible which is a slight inconvenience as my partner needed accessibility. On the up side, I did spot one celebrity as I exit the lift to my room level. 

Room service could be hard to get thru but front desk was readily contactable. They waived off room delivery fees because of the wait to get service. 

Also, I tried requesting for a kettle and it took 4 attempts/request to get one but we eventually got there!

Generally, my stay was pleasant. The pool was my highlight. ",,,,,,,,Bre S,Director of Guest Relations,2016-06-16,"DLLu,

I'm so glad that you were able to find some silver linings and make the most out of your trip.

I am happy to know that you enjoyed the pool area so much, we are very proud of the Tropicana Bar and Cafe. Anytime you plan to be stateside again, and want to come visit the hotel, please reach out and ask for me before hand, so I can help you plan a trip where there are no premieres, and possibly some online packages or deals that will bring the price down a bit.

Courtney P,32,"New York City, New York",2016-05-31,FRIENDS,2016-06-13,2,Extremely let down ,"I can't state how underwhelmed I am by this hotel. My sister and I stayed for a night while driving through CA. Reception was friendly while we checked in and delivered our bags. The renovations show and our room was just modern and trendy enough. We enjoyed the photos by all of the elevators. 

But once we started getting settled in things slowly went downhill. They cram the fridge full of overpriced drinks in addition to the already stocked bar. So don't plan on putting your own bottle of water in there. I've seen overpriced water in hotels but $10 for a bottle of Evian was impressive.  

We went to the pool to relax but it was anything but since the Laguna Hills crowd was arguing over how to split their bill for 45 mins next to us. It took forever to get someone who could take my order for a single drink and they never returned with the water that they offered us. 
 
The bathroom is tiny and the shower has that European style with the open door so water splashes all over the bathroom. You can tell they recognize this problem bc the shower head is facing inward but even still the floor is a huge puddle afterward in spite of a strategically placed bath mat. Oh and the water pressure is horrible. 

As we we getting ready for our dinner at their restaurant Public we wanted coffee. But realized for all of the snacks and drinks available there was no coffee or coffee maker. Really?! This was a shock but we called and were informed coffee is served in the morning by the elevators and so they would have some sent up.  Literally over an hour later just as we were walking out for our dinner did they deliver a kuerig machine. Fine, we would just make our own coffee in the morning. 

We went to the Spare Room and it was a dude heavy crowd with a bad hip hop vibe made worse by the nasty bar tender. The Library bar was better but still wasn't blowing our minds. 

Next morning around 9:30 I went in search of some now badly needed coffee but it wasn't by any elevator in the place. No, after 9 they make you walk to the pool for coffee. Again, really? I was up before 10 and they've almost stopped serving coffee already? Finally get some coffee from the pool  area and the coffee is cold. Not iced just cold. 

Whatever we say to ourselves lets get out of here. We check out and opt to have the bill emailed to us. We never get it. We call and have them resend it. Now we receive it but they've charged us for double the drinks by the pool. After I call they can't explain the discrepancy and are ""looking into it and will get back"" to us. Such a pain for something that shouldn't have been an issue. They literally aren't getting anything right here for a place that should have high service and standards. Guess that's what we get for choosing this location over somewhere West Beverly Hills. ",,,,,,,,Sebastian K,Front Office Manager,2016-07-10,"Dear Ms. Courteny P,

When you have breakfast in the 24 degrees at 7:30 you will probably be next to partygoers who are still awake. It seems to have a pool party every day and every cabana seems to have a private party going. It might not be a great place to stay if you're on a business trip and the location is right in the middle of the silliest part of LA, but... It surely is a lot of fun.

I'm so happy to hear that you had fun during your stay to our hotel. I would also like to thank you for taking the time to leave this review, it means the world to us. While we do our best to cater to all different types of clientele, the pool during a summer weekend is definitely a party atmosphere. Our rooms in our tower are much quieter, and business-friendly, but it sounds like you were here for the party, so I'm thrilled you were able to jump right in. Just know that no matter what it is that you're here for, we have the right room for you. We hope to see you again soon.

TheWanderrr,72,Bahrain,2016-05-31,FRIENDS,2016-06-10,4,"It was a pleasant stay but ""your welcome"" wears off quickly.","Arriving at the Hollywood Roosevelt one immediately  in a way is seduced with the glamorous surroundings. once you enter the hotel it has  a very rich   Gothic atmosphere that  carries and makes you feel the history and lore of the structure, I would be lying if I didn't say it felt eerie, almost as if the place was hiding a secret. 

Reception check in was  efficient yet impersonal and cold.  the room was styled in a  retro and antiquated manner which I found charming and we had a partial view of the Hollywood hills which was spectacular  and windows were large enough to allow ample sunlight that brightened up the room pleasantly , overall the room was quite relaxing over our six night stay. 

Storage space was an issue, however, we accommodated this by just living out of our suticases, bathroom was small but serviceable

You're in the middle Hollywood so the location has to be a a big plus both in terms of driving and end of day activities with two historic theaters (chinese and El Capitan)  a mere couple of steps away .  ample food options around and the hustle and bustle of the Hollywood Boulevard at your doorstep. the sunset strip is a cool thirty minute walk away and the area seemed safe overall with a few homeless people around, but you just have to put your thinking cap on and not fall prey for regular tourist traps.

Now one of the biggest advantages to me was parking, because in close proximity of the hotel was   the Hollywood and Highland center which has a huge underground park, that allowed for overnight parking for 15$ and this saved us quite alot of money had we elected to use the Hotel's valet for  40$ not including tip. 

However,  please research in advance for any premieres occurring durig your stay because the whole area goes into lock down and traffic is a pain. Alice in Wondelrand 2 premiered during our stay and due to the after party being held in the hotel, normal rooms guests had to  use another  entrance but it wasn't really a big deal to me but I can see how others might take this negatively because the hotel doesn't compensate or makeup for this inconvenience to guests, instead we are made to feel like its our fault for intruding! 

overall though, the hotel was a great experience, however, due to the high room price I can't justify staying here again especially since los angeles is rich with options.  In general if you're fascinated with this hotel and its history then you must  experience  it, but if you want to use it as a long term base in LA then there are plenty of other options that are better value for your bucks. 

regardless, it was a pleasant stay but ""your welcome"" wears off quickly.","Key Tip for guests with cars, Hollywood highland underground parking lot is minutes away and much cheaper to use than relying on the hotel.",,3.0,4.0,,4.0,,Bre S,Director of Guest Relations,2016-06-16,"TheWanderrr,

I had lived around from the Roosevelt for many years and found myself there often for various events, activities and food/drinks. It was a no brainer where I would stay that last night.

I booked a cabana room overlooking the Tropicana pool with my girlfriend. The room was amazing. Just as nice and well designed as I had imagined. Waking up and having coffee sitting on our balcony was a great way to start my last day.

Plus the location is great. We decided to check in and head out for the evening. There was so many activities and food/drinks/nightlife within close walking distance. Getting home was no problem either.

Everyone that I encountered, from the front desk during check-in, bartenders, valet staff and the lady who helped during check-out were extremely friendly and helpful.

From the first email where I contacted Bre she was on top of everything for helping pull off a surprise trip to LA. Her response time is super quick, she's detail oriented and a complete asset to the hotel and such a great person to deal with. Being that I work in a customer facing role day in day out I was blown away by her killer service skills. So kudos Bre you really made the stay for us something we will forward on to our friends heading that way. 

From the minute we arrived even our bell staff was so friendly and welcoming. The room was spacious and had everything we needed for the little amount of time we spent there. The pool is amazing and a great way to spend an afternoon chilling in the sun. Just make sure you get a spot early on the hot days. They fill up quick. Location is easy to navigate to pretty much anywhere depending on your plans for your stay. Uber is the way to go it's quick and cheap to get around.

kmkinger,5,,2016-06-30,FRIENDS,2016-06-06,5,Amazing one night only.....,"Our group came in for one night, Saturday-Sunday, to go see a show at the Hollywood Bowl. The Hollywood Bowl is about a 15 minute walk from the hotel --- better off walking btw as a cab takes longer bc of traffic and you'll get there much faster by walking. 

We flew in Saturday morning, knowing full well our room would not be ready - check in is at 3pm - so we dropped off our stuff and took off for brunch. When we came back, the girl at the front desk (I think her name started with an A, Aria, Anya?) was great and we were able to get in our room shortly after 12:30PM. 

We had a poolside cabana room which literally opens up right into the pool area - super convenient if you are there to have a pool party and be right in all of the action. This is not a quiet room so if you're looking for a romantic holiday with peace and quiet, or even kids, a tower room might be a better option. Definitely better for a girls/guys/party weekend. Especially late night -- the music bumped until about 2am. They do provide ear plugs in the room and it did not bother us, but is a reality if you book this room you have to be ok with. 

The room was great, comfortable, clean, and guest services was very accommodating the entire short stay.

haleysicle,16,"Dunn Center, North Dakota",2016-05-31,FRIENDS,2016-06-01,3,Mediocre Experience - Pros & Cons!,"My friend and I stayed Thursday/Friday/Saturday night in a Superior Double Room on the fourth floor. We chose this hotel because of its historical significance and location. This hotel also got great reviews on Trip Advisor, Expedia, and Oyster. I would not choose to stay at this hotel again - for me this experience was more of a ""well now I can say I've done that!"" type. Here are the pros and cons:

PROS:
-Location. You walk out the door and are literally in the middle of Hollywood. El Capitan, TCL Chinese Theater, Walk of Fame, Starline Bus Tours, Ripley's, Dolby Theater, and more are all within 10 minutes walking distance. 
-Room furnishings. The beds, linens, bathroom amenities, TV, furniture are all awesome. Very comfortable stay. Large LG TV with HBO. I also want to mention that it was surprisingly quiet in our room! We barely heard a thing coming from upstairs, outside, or in the hallway.
-Hotel beauty and historical significance. This is a gorgeous hotel - inside and out. Worth seeing even if you aren't staying here.
-Restaurant - 25 degrees. Ate breakfast here and also had dinner and cocktails. Both meals were absolutely delicious and reasonably priced. It was my birthday and our waiter even went out of his way to sing Happy Birthday and brought out ice cream. The bill for two cheeseburgers, shared order of fries, and three cocktails was about $130 including tip. Highly recommend eating here even if you are not a guest at the hotel.

CONS:
-Cleanliness. By far the most irritating... The hotel is just not clean. Elevators are nasty, hallways are nasty. Our bathroom floor was disgusting. The bathroom door had dried streaks of liquid all down the inside and I'm not even going to try and guess what it was.
-Elevator situation. Extremely slow elevators and on Friday night, one of them (there are only two) was broken. Being on the fourth floor, we decided to take the stairs. Let me warn you right now - DO NOT TAKE THE STAIRS. First of all, I don't think they had been cleaned - ever. Doors leading to other floors were either locked or had broken handles. Very confusing trying to actually get out of the stairwell without setting any alarms off. We eventually had to exit the stairwell through a staff door, navigate more stairs, and come out by the security shed. 
-Price tag. It just isn't worth it. Even though our room was nice, it was very cramped. The bathroom is extremely tiny. Beds are only full size. Sure it's boutique, but if you visit the lobby, bar, and restaurant - you're really not missing anything by choosing to spend the night elsewhere.

Other minor details:
Hotel offered free wifi. The staff is very pleasant. Valet service is fast. Room service was great. Public bar cocktails were reasonable. Minibar is stocked with everything you could ever want.",,2.0,4.0,5.0,,,,Bre S,Director of Guest Relations,2016-06-04,"Haley,

Thank you for taking the time to leave this review. Learning how we can better improve our guest experience is invaluable to us. I do apologize for any inconvenience you may have experienced due to the elevators, or just simply the fact that we are a historical property, and not everything runs as fluidly as we would like it too. I understand that cleanliness was a problem during your stay, but I can assure you that is out of the norm for us. Given another chance, I'm sure we could turn around your opinion on our property. If you feel like giving it a shot, and staying with us again, please reach out and ask for me directly so that I can help ensure your next stay blows this past one out of the water.

AngelaJeanne,82,,2016-03-31,FRIENDS,2016-05-31,4,Glamorous Rock n Roll Hollywood Hotel,"My two friends and I booked this hotel while seeing a concert at the nearby Hollywood Bowl. We had 2 rooms and an adjoining large room with a couch and dining room table; all overlooked Hollywood Blvd. The place was cool, old, with lots of young people and people in leather checking in. As it turned out, Disney's Alice Through the Looking Glass was premiering down the street, and the after-party was in the hotel lobby area. This was exciting and fun, but also a pain because we could not enter the party nor access the lobby area or bar (because of the private function). Our rooms were decked out in a cool, hip, clean, style and comfortable beds. The views were terrific. We drank in the large bar where the bartender was friendly. The restaurant connected to the Roosevelt had a good breakfast menu and was designed in keeping with the old Hollywood meets modern rock-n-roll vibe.

You can't help but be excited as you walk down down Hollywood Boulevard, the stars that seem so familiar, the lights and the warm air... From the moment you walk in, it's old Hollywood glamour with a modern edge of luxury.  The beautiful smell as you arrive in the lobby, it's as if the fountain was flowing with Tom Ford cologne.  When I mentioned it was our Honeymoon, we were instantly, kindly upgraded to a Cabana room!  We were warned it would get loud (it did), due to the pool parties but went for it anyway.  

The room was stunning.  Light, airy and mid-century modern but everything did have a price, as a previous reviewer has noted.  Eye-watering mini-bar prices but it's to be expected really.  The balcony had a good view of the pool and we enjoyed a nice breakfast outside, complete with resident Squirrel.  We had a look around the hotel-looked in at the famous ball room where the first Oscars were held but were hurried away.  There is definitely a feeling in the main part of the hotel, I'm not sure if it's haunted but theres something... We sampled the Library bar-no menu, you just tell them what you like.  Cool.  Spotted Charlie Sheen, along with his armed bodyguard.  We enjoyed a burger in the grill, very good along with my first taste of Blue moon.  The Bananas foster is huge and very strong too.  

If you like to feel right in the heart of Hollywood, there's no better place to stay.  I would hire a car next time I'm in L.A it's not great for Public transport.  I recommend the Hollywood museum and Mel's diner which is a 5 minute walk from the hotel too.",Cabana rooms are loud,3.0,5.0,3.0,,,,Bre S,Director of Guest Relations,2016-06-04,"Ktth83,

As this was a holiday weekend the room rates were very fair. Not sure We get the $350++ for a bottle of Veuve Clicquot poolside during the day ,but Piper Heidsieck was $120++ ,so we could live with that.

Captain_J_Spaulding,302,"Miami, Florida",2016-05-31,COUPLES,2016-05-29,4,"Nice Place, Old Hollywood Charm, Good Location... Just Don't Touch Anything","We stayed 5 nights at the Roosevelt recently, using it as a base of operations while exploring Los Angeles since the location is between the Downtown area and beaches at Venice and Santa Monica.  The hotel still evokes the golden glamor days of Old Hollywood, though the surrounding area… eh, not so much.  The staff – at the front desk and in the valet parking - was very friendly and helpful during our stay.  The room itself, billed as a “Superior Room” with a king bed (booked at $339/night and ended at a cost of about $400.00/night with taxes), was very spacious, while the bathroom was also decent-sized and mostly clean (some wear on the floors and the sliding door that separated it from the room had some streaks).  

The TA rating gets knocked down a bit because of several issues but I’ll just note a few that were most obvious and annoying.  First, the level of commercialism that overwhelms on Hollywood Boulevard seemed to seep into the room:  Where most hotels might have a refrigerator/mini-bar or some snacks and leave it at that, here there was a refrigerator (with drinks), snacks and a bar – nothing “mini” about it.  There were some fair-sized bottles of wine, gin, whiskey, tequila, etc. which seemed to go beyond the “convenience” factor and edged into the “Lost Weekend” factor.  A large bottle of water was offered for $10.00 and a smaller one was a mere $6.00 (or you can go to a fine restaurant and have one served to you for the same price).  There were sealed flip-flops with the hotel logo that you normally might find for complimentary use during a stay but they remained sealed due to a $20.00 price tag which implied to me (maybe incorrectly?) that they would be charged to the room if opened.  There was free WiFi only in the lobby (and most Starbucks) but not in this room, unless you added $15.00/day.  Evidently $400/day (actually more like $450/day since we had overnight parking charges also) is not enough to provide free internet access.  It might not bother you and maybe these issues seem trivial, but I’ve stayed in places where I’ve paid one third as much and resorts where I paid three times as much, and I’ve received many more extras than what is offered here.  And let’s be clear:  This is no resort.  

All in all I would still recommend a stay at the Hollywood Roosevelt based on the staff, charm and location.  Just be wary that your room cost/night doesn’t inadvertently double or – if you’re really thirsty – triple.",,3.0,5.0,,,,4.0,Bre S,Director of Guest Relations,2016-06-04,"Captain_J_Spaulding,

stevewb1,19,"Orlando, Florida",2016-05-31,FRIENDS,2016-05-27,5,Old Hollywood Made New,"This hotel is a piece of classic Hollywood history and you can feel the glamour all about but by no means does that mean stodgy.  The fittings and fixtures are all top notch.  Just the right blend of old and new.  Rooms (at least the suites and adjoining) are spacious, fresh, and welcoming.  It felt more like a residence than a hotel.
The location can not be beat and if you're considering a base for a show at the Hollywood Bowl (another fantastic classic that must be experienced in a lifetime) then the Roosevelt is the place to be.
Lounges and restaurants are top notch and just right.  
Surprisingly for LA (and California), I found the value to be strong.
The cherry on top were the employees.  Genuinely interested in providing the best experience and they did - from the front desk, to valet, to the service staff.  A true delight.
Couple sampling history with great accommodations, attentive service, perfect location, and reasonable price (for what your provided), I believe the Roosevelt must be your ""go-to"" stay in Hollywood - if not all of LA.

Outspokentraveler,203,"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",2016-05-31,COUPLES,2016-05-26,3,Once a Hollywood Gem Now a 3-Star Boozey Boutique,"This is a sad story. Stayed here five years ago. Once a grand old hotel, the Hollywood Roosevelt, home of the first Academy Awards, has becomes a noisy, booze-culture, overdone and under-delivered, hotel.

The rooms had been redone a dull grey with red strip in the center of the corridor walls. We felt like it was a re-painted battleship. No artwork in the room. 

The desk was full of exotic and classic boozes. The Blue J Walker to Maker's and that odd-shaped Skull vodka. And a box of condoms. 

The welcome letter -- I included it -- was nice enough but hen pointed out if you lose your key or cannot get in your room, use one of the black hall phones on each floor. Clearly, this is the ""too-drunk-can't-find-my-key"" note, which shows it happens a lot. Not good. 

Menu promised 24/7 coffee and drinks to room; we had to leave at 6 am and tried to arrange for 5 am coffee and was told that service was not available. 

Last, if you stay, ask for a room facing front; the back has a pool and loud, obnoxious music until 2 am many nights of the week; it kept us awake on the 11th floor. We complained and they moved us. Still, it was obnoxious.

Christopher R,24,,2016-05-31,SOLO,2016-05-25,5,Hip Hollywood Haven,"The Roosevelt really has a lot going for it. It's an amazing historic old building that has wonderfully updated and well-appointed rooms. The rooms have character, but meet all modern expectations with great in room bar, comfortable beds, excellent individually controllable HVA/C, quality TV/cable, and even Davines toiletries. The hotel also manages to feel very resort like despite being right on Hollywood Blvd. The Tropicana Pool is very relaxing during the day and often a fun party scene at night. Public is a great fine dining spot. The lobby bar makes some great cocktails, but is low key and accessible. The Spare Room is open late and has all kinds of games and of course, a couple bowling lanes. Finally, 25 Degrees is a great 24 hour burger/breakfast joint...super convenient. While the hotel is very Hollywood hip it has a welcoming vibe for all guests. All of the hotel and restaurant staff are super friendly and professional. Everyone I dealt with from check-in to housekeeping to valet to servers were great. I'm often skeptical of glowing reviews with no negative comments. But, my entire stay really was wonderful. If I were to offer one criticism...the prices at the Tropicana for poolside chair service seem a bit steep with the additional fees.

The history (one of the ballrooms here is the site of the very first Academy Awards in 1927, and Marilyn Monroe had some risque early photos taken by the gorgeous pool), the lovely staff, the beautiful lobby areas and hidden-in-the-corner little bar areas are wonderful.

nanami224,38,"London, United Kingdom",2016-05-31,SOLO,2016-05-11,5,"Wow, what an amazing place","I travelled alone to LA for the weekend and stayed in the Roosevelt. I was blown away. I've stayed in many hotels in different countries but this hotel is a very unique, amazing experience. 

I was wondering before I went why there were some negative reviews. Now I understand because some people might not know what to expect when going there. 

So here is a little advice: If you want a quiet family holiday or want to go to bed at 10pm on a weekend this might be the wrong place for you. There are many nice, quiet hotels in LA that will match what you are looking for but the Roosevelt is not one of them. 

The Hollywood Roosevelt is a place where you stay up all night and enjoy cocktails at the most amazing pool surrounded by huge palm trees. I got a cabana right by the pool on the second floor and there was music until 2am every night but that was perfectly fine because this was the reason I chose this hotel. You can spend the mornings relaxing by the pool with relaxing house music and the nicest hotel staff that will bring you drinks. 

The room was super clean with beautiful interior and a great, comfy bed. The bathroom amenities were just amazing. Of course any drinks and food where not free but I think  this is ok for a hotel like this. If you don't want to spend a fortune on a bottle of water just grab one downstairs in the cvs. It is really not that hard to avoid extra costs. My room in the cabana building had a huge balcony with a stunning view of the pool and the hotel. 

The room service and food was excellent. I ordered breakfast one morning and it arrived very fast. The hotel has many restaurants and bars you can try out, all of them are great, I liked the Spare Room very much and the burger place. Of course they are pricey but the standard of the food and drinks in very high. 

The location of the hotel is very convenient for tourists that want to see Hollywood because it is in the heart of Hollywood. You walk out the door and there it is. I wasn't too keen on exploring Hollywood but it is a good jump off point for other areas of LA. It is easy to avoid the tourist crowds by hopping into an Uber. What impressed me was that the hotel doesn't feel touristy at all. It somehow managed to keep the atmosphere historic, classy and hip.

The hotel staff was simply amazing. Everyone was so kind and friendly. I would come back here anytime. It has been such a great experience. I wish I stayed a bit longer.",If you don&#39;t mind music until 2am go for a balcony room in the cabana house!,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,,Bre S,Director of Guest Relations,2016-05-14,"Marina,

WOW! Thank you so much for leaving this excellent and detailed review. While we do have a room for everyone (big, small, quiet, loud, connecting, etc.) our pool area is certainly a lively scene. Being that lively is exactly what you were looking for, I'm so glad you enjoyed your stay here so much. We wish you could have stayed longer, too. We hope we see you again the next time you are in town.

It is positioned right on Hollywood Blvd, across the road from the Walk Of Fame, Chinese theatre etc. The hotel has kept its old look and feel in the common areas. The rooms are more modern and updated. We were in room 939 which was right at the end of the hall, which made it pretty quiet. The room was small compared to your average hotel room but very comfortable, tiny bathroom as well but it serves it's purpose. The in-room drinks and snacks are pretty expensive, but there is a CVS across the road if need be. The weather was cold when we visited so we didn't get to use the pool, but we did eat at the restaurant, 25 Degrees, at the front of the hotel. Highly recommend it!

It is also only about three blocks from an IN & OUT Burger. The hotel has private parking which is provided at a premium charge, but there are no other overnight parking garages within a mile of the hotel.
For the price, the rooms are very clean and comfortable and provide the traveler with a bird's eye view, if you are lucky, of the Hollywood area.
No need to worry about where to eat, because of the restaurants located withing the building and across the street, in the mall area. If you want to live dangerously, there are street vendors, who serve up a tasty dish.
The desk and parking attendants are very helpful and friendly. If you need information about the hotel or local destinations or a good restaurant, do not hesitate to ask. Make sure you ask about the history of the hotel and the guests who refuse to check out.

sarastar43,1,"Boston, Massachusetts",2016-04-30,BUSINESS,2016-05-02,5,great hotel,"I was in LA for three days in April for a conference, which reserved a block of rooms at the Hollywood Roosevelt at a discounted rate. The rate was for a room with a king bed, and when I checked in they apparently only had king rooms left by the pool, so the staff offered me a choice of that location, or a room in the tower with two double beds, which was both larger and quieter. The manager also gave me three breakfast vouchers for the 'inconvenience' of changing my room type, which was very nice, especially since it wasn't a problem for me at all - as a single traveler I didn't particularly need a king bed, and I had to be up early for the conference each day so quiet was definitely a priority.
The room was lovely and just as quiet as promised, and the breakfast was very tasty. It was also great to be able to store my luggage after I checked out, since we had conference sessions through the afternoon that day.
The only slightly annoying thing is the shower design - it's glassed in halfway, which made it really difficult to turn on without getting wet because you basically have to stand in the shower to reach the controls, and once you are in the shower it was hard to avoid getting water all over the floor. You do also have to pay for wifi in the rooms, but it wasn't particularly expensive and it worked well.","higher in the tower is better for quiet, rooms by the pool good for socializing",,5.0,,,5.0,5.0,Bre S,Director of Guest Relations,2016-05-08,"Sara,

Arrived at 0100 to be awoken at 6:15am by workers repairing an air conditioning unit a few rooms down.  The room was tiny, but fine for just me, but then because it was so tiny I could hear the maids at 8:00am slamming doors in the hallway, instead of opening them and propping them open then closing them silently when they left, especially since they started so early.  Then the next day, I see a charge for $10.90 in addition to my regular room charges come through on my credit card.  I call to find out what it was, and apparently they charged me for a 1l. bottle of Evian.  Before I checked in I had already gone to Von's to buy a case of 6 for the weekend for 9.99 for the entire case.

Thank you for you review, and I truly apologize that your stay with us was anything less than stellar, especially after such built up anticipation. We are a historic property, so our entry level rooms can be unique, but our second and third tier rooms quickly double in size. Renovating our property so that it can keep up with the times without losing it's historical elements has been a challenge, and I am sorry if you felt that you were on the lesser end of any compromise that we have had to make. As for the sound disturbances, I will speak to our staff in hopes that this does not happen again. We would love to see you again, and should you choose to stay with us, please reach out and ask to speak with me directly so that I can ensure your next stay with us lives up to your thirty year wait.

The greatness comes from the building itself, as soon as you walk in from Hollywood Boulevard the central lobby strikes you as a very cool place, the rooms were a little small, but did have a comfy bed and the bathroom was amazing. The not so great unfortunately was how the hotel was run. Front desk was ok, no problems there, but felt as though I was having to watch out from being conned from the £10.00 bottle water on the bedstands and charges for wifi. Then having to deal to the gruff presence of security of other functions in the hotel it was a litte over the top.

Booking directly via their website we found an international promotion rate which seemed very reasonable for a hotel right in Hollywood.

We arrived slightly before check-in but this was not a problem and the check-in staff quickly changed our room so we could have one that was immediately available. They also very kindly upgraded us. We didn't expect either of these things but coming straight off a long flight from the UK, it was a lovely surprise and really appreciated! 

The room was modern, spacious and had a great view of the Hollywood Walk of Fame. We could also see the Hollywood sign from our window. We were celebrating our wedding anniversary so the hotel surprised us with some beautiful deserts in our room and some complimentary water. We were only staying one night but it felt like even so, the Hollywood Roosevelt wanted to make sure we enjoyed every minute of our stay.

We went to the burger restaurant that night, 25 Degrees (reviewed separately) and could not fault it. 

All in all a fantastic hotel to stay in if you're looking for somewhere in Hollywood. Would love to stay again.",We were on the 11th floor which had great views over Hollywood.,,5.0,,,5.0,4.0,Bre S,Director of Guest Relations,2016-04-29,"Stuart & Laura,

ekyloh20140804,65,"Hong Kong, China",2016-03-31,FRIENDS,2016-04-26,3,A bit disappointed,"The hotel located at the middle of Hollywood Blvd, just opposite to the China Cinema, Dolby Cinema, and Madame Tussauds Museum. You can find very nice restaurants along the Hollywood Blvd and inside the China Cinema. 5 mins. walk to the Hollywood Highland Metro Station.
We spent three nights at the Studio Room. The room that the staff first arranged for us was at 2/F, with a big air-conditioning tower outside the window which was very noisy. After negotiated with another staff, they agreed to arrange another room located at 5/F which faced the Hollywood Street and was very nice. Due to this inconvenience caused, the Hotel also gave us two Breakfast coupons at ""25 degree"" restaurant as compensation and we really appreciated that. The breakfast was delicious and the staff there were really very friendly and professional.
However, the air-conditioner inside the room made a lot of noise whenever it turned on. It was quite annoying. 
Besides, on the third day during our stay, there was a party held at the Rooftop. A lot of guests (not hotel guests) came. There was a very long line queuing for the two elevators (which were very small and moved slowly). Some of the hotel guests did not want to wait or already waited for quite a long time that they chose to use the staircases. This was quite disappointing because the hotel staff did not show up and help. It would be good if they could ask the guests to queue into two lines, one for the hotel guests, and another for the guests who join the party, and they can use different elevator.
At the morning after we checked out, no one helped us to handle the baggage. There were about 5 to 6 steps between the Front Desk (Lobby) and the drop-off area. If you do not have baggage with you, that's fine. But if you are with your baggage, you definitely need someone to help.
Generally speaking, the hotel is located at a very good location, some of the staff were nice and helpful, but not all.","High floor, definitely!",3.0,3.0,,5.0,,,Sebastian K,Front Office Manager,2016-04-28,"Dear ekyloh20140804,

Thank you for sharing your experience with us, all feedback is invaluable to us as we improve the hotel each and every day. We are glad to say that with feedback like yours we have implement a new protocol for managing the elevators during extremely busy times that I believe would make you proud of how we handle it. As for the luggage assistance, being a historic hotel we are tied with a structure that is not always the best for our guests experience however that is were the staff is normally incredibly responsive with assisting. I am sorry we did not offer the assistance you needed and were not posted up to help you up the stairs.

I was in a junior suite; a lovely room but with one small but important downside - the sink in the bathroom. It was not possible to (a) adjust the water temperature or (b) fill the sink, on account of a fixed grate over the plug hole (and no plug in any case). All of which meant that a wet shave was impossible.

An item of mine was broken while in the care of this hotels staff and although I was promised many times over that this item would be replaced and that they would remain in contact well ... none of the above has ever happened, I have had to initiate every conversation and follow up regarding this and not once have I been contacted to rectify their hotels mistake and to follow through with there promise of the replacement item. Here we are 8 months later, no replacement, no iniated contact from them, mounting frustration from me and a growing phone bill they still pass around me around and point fingers EVERY TIME WITH NO ACTION TO FULFILL THEIR PROMISE OF A REPLACEMENT.  The managers I have spoken to are worse then the staff who initially broke my item. 

I am disgusted that a hotel which is praised so highly treats their customers the way I have been treated from the time I checked in until this very day.

This is a very cool hotel with loads of historical features. We stayed in a Cabana room around the pool on the second floor and loved the view of the pool, people watching and super cool tunes played throughout the day and night. The room itself was a good size and had everything we needed. Be careful not to open the Evian next to your bed though, it will cost you $6 US a pop! We found a convenience store close by and bought a few supplies including our own beers and water for a quarter of the price. It was a central location and although completely fine, a little touristy right on the Hollywood walk of fame.

The check-in area is fairly small and drab to be honest, its not particularly impressive, located at the back of the hotel, below the street ground level.  I began to think maybe I had over-hyped this place and would enviably be disappointed.

The check-in staff was very very friendly and helpful.  They let us check-in early, which was really appreciated.   We were told loads about the hotel amenities and bars etc., it was all a lot to take in.  We were allocated room 739.  The receptionist said it was a nice room, and located on a corner of the hotel so only had one adjoining room.

The room was fairly small, perfectly formed, but I was a bit under-whelmed.   The shower room was very small and you struggled for space to dry, outside of the shower., there wasn’t even adequate room to place your toiletries around the sink.       The room was decorated in a basic style with dark wood furniture, which I felt even made the room feel even smaller.  The room was adequate, but when paying $300 plus a night, I was expecting more and better.   Also we discovered wifi was chargeable to guests, $15 a day, but free to people in the downstairs bar.  This is probably my biggest complaint of my stay.  Charging for wifi, when paying $300 plus a night I think is totally unacceptable.  This made you feel like you weren’t staying in luxury hotel, but somewhere more budget where they were trying to re-coup every penny out of of guests. 

We checked out the pool area which was lovely, and did have a luxury classic feel about it.  Similarly the hotel lobby, and Public bar area were lovely, atmospheric and full of charm.  However most evenings, we found the chesterfield sofas in the lobby, had reserved signs on the tables, so you couldn’t actually sit there.  The location is in a fairly touristy part of LA, and we were getting cabs each night into West Hollywood to go out for dinner and drinks etc.

Our stay was fairy uneventful until our 3rd night.  On out 3rd day, the lobby was been re-arranged and closed off.  We found out it was the venue for the wrap party for American Idol.  On that night all the hotel bars etc were closed off.  The security staff treated us in an applauding manner when trying to get into the hotel and shouted at us.  The event wasn’t been held in a private function room, but the main lobby of the hotel, which was off-limits.   We complained to reception who said the manager would be in, in the morning.  In the morning, the manager was very apologetic and said the security wasn’t the hotels own, but brought in by American Idol.  We were given drinks vouchers and $100 credit to spend in the hotel.  This wasn’t much when you considered you much per night we were paying to stay.  

We left with mixed views, although the hotel staff was v helpful friendly etc, apologetic etc, we didn’t feel very welcome in the hotel given the American Idol incident, and that our custom/ hotel experience wasn’t important.   We choose the hotel due to its amenities, bars etc, but as we learnt we weren’t free to use these.  I’m not sure if the hotel is used regularly for private functions which close off many of the public areas.  The rooms are small, although the pool area is lovely and a destination in its own right. Overall I felt the hotel was over-priced for the experience we had, particularly when wifi is chargeable!!!!!",,2.0,4.0,,,3.0,,Kevin B,General Manager,2016-04-23,"Dear Ian C,
Thank you for your review, and your feedback provided.  I am happy to hear that the staff was engaging, and that we did attempt remedy the situation.

The interior is ok, and very old ""Hollywood"".  Spare, but clean interior in the rooms, but the rooms are small and the bathrooms very small.  With that said, we were unfortunate enough to be there when a wedding was being held.  The wedding party stayed up for 2 days straight, screaming, yelling, running down the halls, slamming doors and were completely out of control.  We complained at least 5 times to the night staff and they would send security up.  The party would shut up while security was there, but they minute they left, it would start up again.  One time they ran down the hallway, pounding on every door, yelling obscenities.  I can't understand why they weren't evicted on the spot.  

Everything after that was not worth mentioning.  The trip was ruined and I will never make the mistake of staying there again.",Don&#39;t stay here!,,1.0,,4.0,,3.0,Kevin B,General Manager,2016-04-23,"Dear AlohaLadyHonolulu,

As to the size of the room we are a historic property, and our entry level rooms can be unique, however our second and third tier rooms actually start to double in size for those who value space as a key component.  Please do reach out to me directly should you wish to return, and I am sure that we can regain your faith in The Hollywood Roosevelt.

The hotel is situated right along the walk of fame and would be perfect for a family traveling with kids, or first timers who want to do all the touristy things like we did. 

The hotel has everything you need.. A gym, 24hr room service and a pool. 
The rooms are on the smaller side especially the bathroom, but if it's a short stay or you're not planning to be in them for very long then they are fine. 

All the staff at the hotel are really professional and friendly, they even went out of their way to surprise us with an anniversary and birthday gift, they are what makes the hotel.

Trish M,5,,2016-04-30,FRIENDS,2016-04-16,2,"Perfect Location if you are invited to a premier, but I was not!!","Hotel is beautiful, check in went seamlessly, and room was very nice but only had a view of the back parking lot.  I should have gotten a clue about the hotel traffic by the earplugs they provide on your nightstands.
The first day we weren't allowed in the lobby, lobby bar, and lobby elevators were shut down while they prepared for a TV show premier party.  We had to go down a set of stairs to the garage level and take that elevator to our floor. A little inconvenient but doable.
The night of the premier, we weren't even allowed to enter into the front door of the hotel. We were told we had to walk around the block to the back entrance to get to our elevators.  Really!!!!!
I was a paying customer (almost 400.00 per night) and I had to use the back entrance so the celebrities wouldn't be inconvenienced by our presence.
When I complained, they told me this was a last minute booking and they were sorry. This was in no way a last minute booking because they were doing the same thing the day we left for another premier. They offered me a $100 credit toward my bill and sent up chocolates with a note from the manager, which was nice but I was still angry.
If you only want to rent your rooms to famous people good luck, because I will not be back nor will I recommend anyone to your hotel.
It would pay them to be more",,,1.0,3.0,5.0,,,Kevin B,General Manager,2016-04-23,"Dear Trish M,

My apologies for the troubles caused with one of our Hollywood Premiers.  We do require that the public spaces be accessible until such an event starts, and stops.  The hotel does have alternative access to all guest areas for when such an event is taking place, and I apologize as this is a standard to offer to our guests.  One of our unique aspects about The Hollywood Roosevelt is that we have up to 8 other outlets in the hotel open when the lobby is being used for such a large Premier, and again I apologize if these alternatives were not presented.  
Please do let me know if you would like to speak further about your stay.  I am also happy to assist with any future bookings for when you return to Hollywood, as I am sure that we can regain your faith in the property.

djh1,6371,"Melbourne, Australia",2016-01-31,FAMILY,2016-04-14,4,Hollywood Glamour in the Heart of Hollywood,"The Roosevelt is a beautifully renovated hotel, right in the heart of Hollywood.  It would usually be too expensive for us for a family trip, but we were offered a 30% international discount while booking on line, which brought it well into our budget.  In fact it ended up much cheaper than if we had stayed at the Best Western Sunset Plaza, which is where we stayed last time.

We had three rooms booked for us, our son and the family that we travelled with.  We had requested high floor rooms with views.  The other two rooms met these criteria, but I was disappointed with ours, which was very small and overlooked Hollywood High rather than the Hollywood Sign which was our preference.  I called the front desk and they happily swapped us to a far nicer room on a much higher floor, with the exact view we wanted.  While this was much appreciated, I can’t work out why they didn’t simply put us in the better room in the first place.

The rooms had everything required except tea and coffee making facilities and wine glasses.  We love to buy a bottle of wine and have it in our room before dinner and I have never stayed in a hotel that didn’t provide wine glasses before.  We got around this by buying drinks at the bar and bringing the glasses back to our rooms.  Tea and coffee was provided in the lobby and by the pool up until 10.00am.  While this is okay, I really like to be able to make a coffee in our room before needing to get dressed.  The coffee was also served in paper cups, this seems to be a US thing, particularly in California.  It is a shame as nothing tastes good from a paper cup!

There was a vast array of items to purchase in the rooms.  All of them were ridiculously expensive, such as rubber thongs for $20, bottles of water for $7.  We didn’t even look at the mini bar prices, I imagine they would have been horrendous.

The hotel has a number of bars and restaurants.  We had drinks in pretty well all of them, and ate dinner in 25 Degrees, the burger restaurant that also serves breakfast.  We had eaten at 25 Degrees on our last trip and loved it.  It was still just as good, fantastic burgers and chips.  The breakfast menu was the most expensive of any of the many breakfast menus we had had during our almost four week trip.  We decided to eat there the first morning as we had a private tour and were in a hurry, the plan was to find somewhere cheaper the other days.  The food however was fabulous!  All eight of us thoroughly enjoyed the variety of breakfast options we chose, so we ended up eating there every morning.  We didn’t mind the cost for the great quality.

We had one day where something was being filmed in the lobby, which meant that we couldn’t use the area.  It was only during the day though and we were out sightseeing all day so it wasn’t a problem.  By the time we returned in time for dinner, the lobby was available again.

All in all, if you can get a good rate, I recommend staying at the Roosevelt.  Just bring your own wine glasses, water etc and you will thoroughly enjoy it.",High floors are quieter and have better views.,,4.0,4.0,5.0,,,Bre S,Director of Guest Relations,2016-04-30,"I'm so glad that you were able to take advantage of one of our promotional discounts, and that you all enjoyed your stay with us.

The room was fabulous, great location. The hotel had a Tai Cruz conference on for 3 of the 4 days we stayed, which appeared to be the main focus of the hotel during this time and caused snarl ups at the valet. Worth checking before you stay what functions they have scheduled.

My main issue was being charged for wifi, its 2016 and is provided free with a cup of coffee so why are hotels still charging for it? You can stand in the main lobby and receive it free - not easy to do with hundreds of Tai Cruz delegates in the area. I complained to reception who were uninterested in my issue. At checkout I was asked how my stay was and I raised it again, the gent I spoke to really didn't care and ignored everything I said and handed me my bill.

There was a Game of Thrones party in the lobby (reading other reviews, sounds like this kind of thing happens often). So we were sent around back to the rear entrance. Not the end of the world, but not very welcoming. 

I live in NYC so when I travel, my favorite part of staying in hotels is having space. The standard rooms here are small and the bathrooms are a joke. There is a sink but no counter space at all. If you like having space to do your hair or makeup, stay somewhere else. 

On top of the room being on the small side, it is LOUD and the bed wasn't comfortable in my opinion.

Andrew M,9,"Bracknell, United Kingdom",2016-04-30,FAMILY,2016-04-11,1,Off limits Hotel,"We stayed a night in April which coincided with the American Idols final. In short this meant that the hotel was pretty much shut down to the guests, the historic lobby was off limits and also being sent away from the front entrance as we HAD to use the rear. Other challenges include room not be available on time and wifi that costs $15.95 a day

On the positive side the shower was very nice, the room was ok but the other happenings left us feeling a little sour. Communication from the hotel on what was happening was non existent which didn't really help matters.",Stay in another hotel,,,,,,,Kevin B,General Manager,2016-04-23,"Dear Andrew M,

My apologies for the troubles caused with one of our Hollywood Premiers.  We do require that the public spaces be accessible until such an event starts, and stops.  The hotel does have alternative access to all guest areas for when such an event is taking place, and I apologize as this is a standard to offer to our guests.  One of our unique aspects about The Hollywood Roosevelt is that we have up to 8 other outlets in the hotel open when the lobby is being used for such a large Premier, and again I apologize if these alternatives were not presented.  
Please do let me know if you would like to speak further about your stay.  I am also happy to assist with any future bookings for when you return to Hollywood, as I am sure that we can regain your faith in the property.
Thank you,

We ordered four cappuccino, 15-20min later they bring us latte-looking cappuccinos in cups. I asked for new once which took at least 20 more minutes. To my surprise we receive a check with the amount of $39.24. Including: SVC CHRG 15%, Trop admin FEE 1.50 and tax $3. So disappointing. You'd think that after we got wrong coffees and extra waiting they could approach the situation differently. No more coffee for my friends!",,,,,,,,Kevin B,General Manager,2016-04-23,"Dear Monalisalegend,
My apologies for your poor experience. We have specific presentations being that Tropicana is surrounding our pool, and we do not use glass or china for safety, however our standards were clearly not followed in this situation.  It sounds like we failed to deliver on service, and I apologize for this.  We are gearing up for pool season now, and I am confident that a totally different experience would be received for when you wish to return.

David N,5,"Marietta, Georgia",2016-04-30,FAMILY,2016-04-03,2,Not for families and non smokers,"The Good:
- Great location for tourists
- Cabana suite next to the pool, convenient and pretty cool during the day
- Good food poolside, DJ poolside
- Friendly staff
- Decent pool and exercise room

The Bad:
- SMOKING EVERYWHERE, in the eating area by the pool and all around the pool, haven't been subjected to this much smoke since I was a kid in the 70s and 80s (I thought California was supposed to be healthy - NOT here, bring a gas mask)

- The coolness of the poolside Cabana Suite disappears at night when partying continues way past 2am - couldn't sleep either night of our stay

- Dark room, even during the day (staff had offered to bring another light but never even replaced the blown bulbs - still would have been pretty dark anyway)

- Large pool, but told throwing a ball with my son (even a beach ball) was unsafe and against the rules - but SMOKING POOLSIDE AND IN THE POOL was OK. SERIOUSLY?!

The Bottom line:
If the hotel became non smoking or had designated smoking areas away from public areas and cut the noise off at midnight we would go back.  If you are a smoker in your 20s or enjoy enough second hand smoke to give you cancer over a weekend stay this is the place for you.  Families with kids - look elsewhere.",,4.0,3.0,,5.0,,,Kevin B,General Manager,2016-04-23,"Dear David N,

jdmiller83,421,"Sydney, Australia",2015-12-31,COUPLES,2016-04-02,5,THE place to stay in Hollywood and probably even LA!,"My wife and stayed here for 4 nights in late December and had a fantastic time.  This place is just the bomb.  The history and iconography of the place alone is impressive, but the hotel is so much more than just that.  

Upon arrival, the staff could not have been friendlier or more helpful. Maps, directions, details and some free wifi for our stay were just the start before we headed to our room.  

The room is big enough, not too small, but certainly not overly spacious.  There was more than enough room for the both of us to co-exist for our time here thankfully!  Our room overlooked the Hollywood strip, so a great place to gaze out in wonder.  

The rooms are decked out in modern furnishings, a little dark with the decor and sporadic lighting, but it all worked together to create a very 'Hollywood' feel. 

The Roosevelt is in the best location for a newbie to Hollywood and LA like we were.  It's very close to the major pick ups for tours, not too far from Universal Studios, and for those wanting to enjoy some Hollywood action on screen, you can throw a rock at TCL Graumann's theatre.  Take a walk along the Hollywood walk of fame right outside your door. 

In summer I can only imagine the hive of activity around the pool. Being winter, and an unseasonably cold one at that, we didn't get to experience all that the pool had to offer, but what a great place to hang out on a cabana in the summer time.  

We were given a couple of free drink vouchers upon arrival, and where you use these is really up to you. There are several bars in the hotel.  All have their charm, although by far my favourite one was the one that included a 2 lane ten pin bowling alley.  Whilst we went sight unseen on the celebrity front, all of the bars are known haunts for celebrities, so keep your eyes out!

It truly is a wonderful hotel experience, and I'd highly recommend a visit here no matter the season.  Happy travels.",Ask for the best room for a view - the higher the better.,,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,Bre S,Director of Guest Relations,2016-04-30,"Wow! Thank you for such a wonderful review.

From the moment I walked in, my breath was taken away! The architecture and style of this hotel is so welcoming. There is no lack of beauty and interesting sights to look at. 

The big lobby makes you feel like you are in a Nostalgic era with the long drapes hanging from ceiling to floor, the gorgeous Chandelier, the water fountain, to the beautifully painted ceiling and fine faux walls.

The Roosevelt Hotel is truly a place to stay when visiting Hollywood! If you can't stay, to at least come and see. Outside by the Valet, you can take your photo with a statue of Charlie Chaplin, or wander down and take a peek at Beacher's Madhouse.

They have free Wifi and complimentary coffee and tea service strategically located throughout the hotel until 10 a.m. each morning.

kent19,428,"Mumbai, India",2016-03-31,COUPLES,2016-03-30,4,"Historic Hotel, old world charm lobby with small rooms","Firstly, the hotel is located very conveniently at Hollywood Walk of Fame and nothing is too far from here. You have the Star Line Tours buses starting from across the street, numerous restaurants around to whet your hunger pangs, a metro station few meters away or even when you want to walk & spot your favorite stars on the Walk of Fame - well, its right there, as soon as you step out of the Hotel. 
The historic lobby is charming no doubt and their restaurants have a special buzz in the evenings for sure. 

However, the rooms are quite small. We had asked for a higher floor room and we got one on the 4th floor, overlooking a huge bill board (certainly not high enough)! Anyway, we really did not spend that much time in the room, well, who would when you are in LA. A lot of amenities in the room is up for sale, even slippers ! We would have expected atleast those as complimentary for the price they command for their rooms! (Not the fancy flip-flops which they place for sale but atleast the use & throw types). 
And why no shower gels in the bathrooms (we got them at the Campton Place, San Francisco) - here they place just thin strips of soap. Had to also request for a shower cap which was not pre-placed. 
The housekeeping lady on our floor did a good job of cleaning the room except for one day when she was replaced by a guy. 

The complimentary tea/coffee set up in the lobby, with to-go paper cups was certainly appreciated. Wish they would have a similar set up in the afternoon too.

Once we pulled in to valet though they took over, took care of the car, took care of the luggage and made us feel like royalty. 

The room view was amazing- we could see the Hollywood Sign from one window and right down the Blvd. from the other window.  The room was so clean and comfy I wished we could stay longer.

The room seemed dangerously tiny---I kept worrying I would break a toe on the poster bed. Large amounts of very visible dust along the floorboards—dirty sink---dingy towels. 

Nothing was free—wifi in room was extra. No cups or drinking glasses in the room --- water in room was $7-10/bottle. No coffee maker or tea--NOTHING! There was rose scented lotion in a tiny cheap plastic bottle but no deodorant or razors or any nice extras at all—no designer touches such as fancy folded towels or luxury soaps. This being Hollywood, there were, however, condoms. 

Elevator was very scary---glitchy every time I used it. I suppose the atmosphere is ok if you like “venerable,” very dark, and pictures of Hollywood stars obviously traumatized by paparazzi. 

No business facilities at all!!!!---they offered to have me email my document (which was on a very private subject) to the hotel and they would print out a few pages only. No photocopier available. They had two very public computers for guest use, but you had to stand to use them. Wifi in lobby was correctly labeled by the hotel as ""tortoise"" speed---this was useless and inexcusable when La Quinta for $70/night has high speed!

In addition, the wait for a reserved room was very long. Guests arriving at 6 pm still had to wait over an hour for their reserved room to be vacated---I witnessed one guest screaming repeatedly that he had bought the most expensive room in the hotel just so he would get great service, but was made to wait over one hour in the lobby for the previous guest to vacate and for the room to be cleaned. I waited about 1 ½ hour for mine---though promised a phone call on my cell when ready, I never got the notification. 

Hotel does not offer shuttle to airport. Tried to get a private airport shuttle, but front desk staff said they were not allowed to even talk to me about private shuttles and they could not help me arrange one.

Just in contrast, the next night I spent $80/night at Travelodge, and I enjoyed it much, much more.

If you are a tourist or business traveler thinking you will splurge on a luxury experience and get work done, you will be in for a grave disappointment.",,,,,,,,Sebastian K,Front Office Manager,2016-04-28,"Dear DenC_10,

We wanted to apologize for failing to meet the standards you had for us and express that we do try to accommodate all types of travelers from the business traveler to the leisure traveler. 

While, we don't offer some of the services a La Quinta Inn or Travellodge offer in the room these are all available upon request. We do also hope you were able to make your way to some of our top rate food and beverage outlets and to Tropicana Pool and Cafe that has been a central part of Hollywood for over 50 years.

We do hope to see you again and want to ensure you get a true Roosevelt experience. For that next stay please reach out to me directly and I will ensure we meet your standards.

Eric C,1,,2016-03-31,BUSINESS,2016-03-26,5,Can't beat this hotel and its service,"I spend about 1.5-2 months total out of the year in LA for business and have tried nearly every hotel in the city. This is by far the best hotel with the best service. The mix of crazy, sexy and cool is apparent in its rich Hollywood history, sheik design by Yabu Pushelberg, and constant stream of celebrity clientele and beautiful patrons at its various bars and world-famous pool. At the same time, the tower rooms and suites are well appointed for business travel with large sprawling desks and comfortable chairs. Despite being right on boisterous Hollywood Blvd, the rooms in the tower are fairly quiet, and the low-key rear valet entrance makes everyone feel like a VIP upon entering, and allows you to avoid Hollywood altogether if you want. The hotels greatest asset, however, is its amazing staff led by their incomparable Director of Guest Relations, BRE SMITH. They know your name, anticipate your needs, can assist with nearly anything you want to do in LA, and perform everything with a warm smile and courteous demeanor. You know they will go well out of their way to make your stay the very best possible hospitality experience. And Bre makes herself surprisingly accessible and responsive as the director if there's ever anything you need. As someone who travels for work more than half a year and stays at dozens of hotels around the country, the Roosevelt is the top hotel stay, and the one I look forward to the most. Highly recommended.",,,,,,,,,,,,0
Evan M,38,"Jog Road, Florida",2016-03-31,COUPLES,2016-03-26,3,"Great location, but don't' pack too much since no place to unpack clothes","My wife and I stayed here for the first part of our 9 night California vacation. We had a wedding downtown, but decided to stay here due to the location instead of staying with the other wedding guests in a downtown hotel. I will start with the positives. The location is great. You are in the heart of Hollywood. A lot of tourists, reminded me of being in Times Square. Other positive, the room was clean and a good size. The big negative for us was having to live out of our suitcase while staying here for 4 nights. I have never been to a hotel that did not have a dresser or any drawer space at all. When I booked this hotel I joined the Iprefer program. I was not familiar with the Iprefer hotel program at the time of booking. I learned that one of the perks of joining was a room upgrade upon availability. When checking in I asked if an upgrade was available. I was told nothing was available during my stay, however if I wanted to pay $30.00 more per night I could be upgraded. I declined. So much for the Iprefer benefits. When we got to the room and started to unpack our suitcases, we noticed we had no where to store our clothes. The night stands couldn't even fit socks. I went downstairs to the front desk and asked if there was a room with a dresser or drawer space available in the hotel. The gentleman working at the front desk checked but was not aware of any rooms offering a dresser, so he asked his manager if anything could be done. The manager told him we can be moved to a larger suite, where we would be very happy. When he asked his manager, right in front of me, if the move to a suite was complimentary, the manager told him, "" oh no, it's available for $50.00 night."" I declined, but what upset me was when I checked in the suite was $30.00 more per night, and now it was $50.00 night?? Also I felt it was unprofessional of the manager to offer a suite and in front of me say oh no it's not complimentary, it is $50.00 more per night. I didn't need a larger room, I just didn't need a place to store my clothes. We ended up just living out of our suitcases for our stay, but when you pack for a 9 night vacation, that is not ideal. But, if you are planning to stay here for a night or two, it's a nice place to stay, although the Loews right across the street would probably be my choice if I come back to Hollywood.",Hotel overlooking Hollywood Blvd allows you to see iconic Hollywood sign,3.0,3.0,,,,5.0,,,,,7

The hotel has beautiful common areas, especially the historic lobby and the pool.  It was surprisingly quite at night--we didn't have any issue with noise at night even with one room facing Hollywood boulevard. Valet parking while not cheap was very fast and convenient.  There's not a huge amount to do within walking distance so be prepared to drive for most sight-seeking, but it is exciting to have Hollywood ""stars"" on the sidewalk right in front of the hotel and the place they hold the academy awards just a block or so away.  Altogether a good experience.  Tip:  join iPrefer, and book through them.

The staff were very accommodating when we arrived early morning from our flight from Australia. They went out of their way to get a room available for us, although we were much earlier than check in time.
The room themselves are very clean, with modern décor. We had a King Suite, which contains two rooms. The lounge area is a great addition, with a large dining table, and sitting room. This room also contains a sofa bed that you can get made up on request if required. The bedroom is nicely decorated, and has a lovely four poster king bed. The bed is very comfortable. Our room looked out over Hollywood Blvd, Hollywood hills with the Hollywood sign in the background. I LOVE the outlook of this room, my favourite thing to do is open the window and look at all that’s going on in Hollywood.
 
The location is perfect, central to everything. There is free tea and coffee in the lobby in the mornings in the lobby, along with free Wi-Fi in the lobby. Wi-Fi is paid in the room, but has reasonable rates and packages when staying for longer periods. Room service menu is good, and food is delicious and nicely presented.

ilovetostaycation,49,,2016-03-31,FAMILY,2016-03-23,4,Excellent rooms-not exactly a family hotel,"I love the interior of the hotel room. It's gorgeous. The shower doesn't have a tub, but it's a totally separate room from the toilet. It's spacious, and well designed. There is a walk in closet and a secretary table that keeps all the liquor, a complete mini bar. 

It wasn't noisy, but I guessed it could be if there's an event nearby because you can hear sirens wailing from the room, they provide ear plugs! Downside is everything comes with a price. The water, the slippers, etc. there's no free coffee or tea in room either. 

But while I loved the room, the lobby isn't very impressive. It's small and dark. The doors leading up to it doesn't look anything like a grand hotel either. And it was pretty dark everywhere, bad lighting. I guess thats how some people like it, especially if you're the partying kind. But when you're with your kids, it makes it kind of uncomfortable. 

If you're a couple, great. If not, it's too pricey for a family vacation. 

Location is great. A 3-minute walk to the Chinese theater, Dolby theater where the Oscars are held and the walk of fame. Also where most tours start when you're taking one. 

Staff are very friendly and courteous. Wi fi access is not free, unless you upgrade to specific rooms.

Food in the hotel was wonderful and the service was first rate and friendly without being invasive.

My company had our annual outing there last night and it was awesome! We pre-arranged a historic tour of the property and it made the night super special. Jasmine was our tour host and she did an awesome job. She took us to every nook and cranny in the hotel and gave us great stories and history. We saw the Blossom Ballroom where the first Academy Awards were held, we saw the suite where Marilyn Monroe stayed and got her start, we saw their beautiful pool and newly opened outdoor bar and lounge by the pool (super cool for a party) and more. 

We had our outing upstairs in the ""Spare Room"" with two bowling lanes. We had specialty cocktails made in their unique bar downstairs and we ate a lot of great food and sampled many of their unique cocktails on their bar menu. They have some serious good drinks and very unique ingredients.

I should say I also hosted my high school reunion at the Roosevelt and worked with Ernie and he made that night super special for our guest count of over 300! 

Bre is the Director of Guest Relations and she took really special care of us making me look great in front of my colleagues. (Thanks Bre!)

Mary C,184,"Dallas, Texas",2015-10-31,COUPLES,2016-03-01,2,Not worth the price.,"I'm going back and fourth between a 2 and a 3 rating because of this place. My boyfriend and I came here for Halloween and his friend booked us a room at this place. And as you know, this hotel is a classic and it's well known around Hollywood.

According to people who come here, it's supposed to be popular among celebrities and this is the place to go to ""hook up with hot chicks."" Of course, my boyfriend didn't choose this place because he was already with a hot chick (Ha, WHAT. That's me. ;) ) But don't get your hopes up, you guys. I started to realize that after being at this hotel, this hotel is mainly booked by men. My guess is that the girls show up, thinking that they want to be an actress or some sort in Hollywood, think that the guys are producers and therefore; hook up with them. I may be wrong... But that is definitely what I've noticed.

Anyway, when we arrived the parking is valet and it wasn't crowded when we came by but of course it was crowded the day of Halloween because they were throwing a huge, overly priced party. This hotel was smack down in the middle of Hollywood and it was almost the center of everything. You could see the streets and you can see everything that was going on this day. The service was nice and the staff was helpful and informative.

Other than the customer service, the location, and how the hotel was set up... There were quite a bit of cons. First off... The bathroom didn't have a lock. It was like a sliding door that should've been on the closet, not the bathroom. I think my boyfriend got self-conscious when I was walking past the door. The shower didn't have an entire coverage. It was just like half a glass covering the shower and so a lot of the water was getting out and started covering the bathroom floor. The place was dusty (I'm very clean and detail-oriented). The place looked old and needed to be renovated, but that's predicted considering it is an older hotel. The canopy bed that we had, looked really nice and was comfortable, but was somewhat dirty. I think I found dog fur on the body pillow (tossed it to the side), and there was some sort of black stain on my boyfriend's pillow (tossed that to the side, too).

I wish I knew how the pool looked, but unfortunately the pool deck was covered by a whole bunch of chairs and whatnot due to the party. Another thing, the walls are extremely thin. I was able to hear the people across the hall partying and you can smell the marijuana everywhere.

I've stayed at better hotels. This hotel is not worth the price.",,,4.0,3.0,,2.0,,,,,,44

If you want to bask in all that history, book a stay. I have stayed there a few times over the years. It's always a fun experience.

The history of the hotel along with it being a popular location for films and TV shows makes this place quite tempting to stay at. I stayed 4 nights in early Feb and experienced 2 room categories.
For the first two nights I stayed in a Superior Double Room.
At 300 square feet the room was a decent size for 2 adults. The leather seater, wooden table and big LCD TV was a nice touch as was the timber floors instead of the overly used carpet. I'm a big fan of Timber floors! Bathroom was very spacious as was the shower offering both the traditional fixed shower head and a movable one. 
For my last 2 days I moved into a Studio Double Room. Very impressive to say the least! Spacious (500 Square Feet) room, the décor and furnishings were similar to the Superior Double Room however we were treated to 2 bathrooms, 2 LCD Screens, a nicer street view of Hollywood. A much more comfortable experience for 2 adults.
The facilities at the hotel are what you would expect from one with such a great reputation as the Roosevelt. A pool in the centre courtyard of the hotel is flanked by a nice Bar called the ‘Tropicana’. A more intimate bar is also available right next door for those wanting a bit more privacy as well. I managed to soak in the Roosevelt atmosphere by sitting by poolside with a beer and great L.A weather. The in house Night Club ‘Teddy’s’ is also a feature of the hotel, unfortunately it was closed for renovations during our stay. For guests wanting to host big functions, the ball room at the hotel can cater for big events, a fun fact that we discovered was that the very first Academy Awards was hosted at the Roosevelt ball room! We noticed it was booked for a Bar Mitzvah on our second night at the hotel.
I also managed to experience some of the hotel's core offerings such as 'the Spare Room' which holds 2 bowling alleys and a cocktail bar! Amazing little place.
I also spent one evening in the hotel's fine dining restaurant ‘The Public Kitchen’. The roasted Bone Marrow and Pork Chop were the standout dishes for me! I highly recommend it! 
Overall this hotel pulls all the stops and is everything and more that you could ask for in a hotel in Los Angeles. I've seen many other iconic hotels fall by the wayside due to drops in servicing standard and neglecting to renovate, however the Hollywood Roosevelt I can happily report has kept it's reputation intact, you get the sense the manager is working with a tight crew here, the servicing all the way from the valet parking crew to the reception and bar guys is impeccable!

Rob Zilla,16,"San Diego, California",2016-02-29,BUSINESS,2016-02-22,5,Hip Hotel in the Heart of Hollywood,"I love The Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel.  When I used to travel for work, the Rosie was a frequent destination.  What was surprising to me was after making my reservation, I was contacted by Bre Smith, Director of Guest Relations, welcoming me back to the hotel and asking if I had any special requests for my stay.  Since I was traveling with a colleague, my only request was for a room with 2 beds, which she instantly took care of.  Upon arriving to the hotel, I could tell that portions of the hotel had been respectfully renovated, providing for much needed upgrades while preserving the historical integrity of the property.  Check in was a breeze, as the front desk was already prepared for our arrival and lasted about 3 minutes in total.  After a quick elevator ride to the 7th floor, we walked into our room.  On the desk were a couple of adult beverages, a light snack, and most importantly a hand written note from Ms. Smith welcoming us back to the Roosevelt.  In this day and age where customer service is incredibly rare, the simple gesture of a hand written note just set the tone for a great stay.  The rooms are the Roosevelt aren't the most spacious in the world, but if you're staying in Hollywood, the Rosie really is the center of the universe.

The staff here are very friendly and helpful even when there was film crew filming something in the lobby, they wasn’t dismissive when we asked questions or blocking us from going anywhere in the hotel. My one bad point (which might seem trivial to some) is the Wifi wasn’t free in our room, it was $14 per night, and if you are staying for a week can be quite expensive. It was free in the lobby but was annoying when you wanted to face time family from home or just check the weather or google places to eat etc, as being from the UK international data roaming charges can get really expensive. But I would still recommend this hotel to anyone thinking about coming to LA.",,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,,,,,,2

Kristin S,35,,2016-02-29,BUSINESS,2016-02-21,3,Cabana Room Clean but Not Quiet.,"The location is great.  Truly in the heart of Hollywood, located directly across from Grumman's Theater.  So, it's a great hotel choice for those traveling on vacation that want to see + do many of the classic tourist attractions.  
I was traveling for business, but was working just over the hill during the days, so it was easy access to the valley and saved a lot of commute time, had we been staying in West Hollywood or Santa Monica.  
I also loved, how there were several restaurant locations on site of the hotel, as well as the history and architecture.

With all that being said, when I checked-in for my four night stay, I was upgraded to a Cabana room.  Although clean, fairly comfortable, and a beautiful view of the pool area and tower, the noise level was beyond what I had experienced in other hotels before.  Upon checking in, the front desk staff did share that the room can get noisy on the weekends.  However, since I was checking in on a Monday and departing Friday morning, I did not have great concerns.  I've also stayed at other hotels that have reputations for being loud, but have never been overly bothered by the noise.  However, when I returned to my room, after checking in only hours before, the noise level was barely tolerable.  There was a live band/event taking place in the pool area and it felt like the band was in my room.  Thankfully it quieted down around 10pm.  However, on Thursday evening a DJ was playing in the pool area and the music stayed at amazingly loud levels until 2am.

If you plan to sleep during your stay, I don't recommend taking the 'upgrade' to the pool area.  Overall, the Roosevelt Hotel was nice.  I probably wouldn't choose to stay here again, but also wouldn't be opposed if others I would be traveling with wanted to stay.","For a quieter stay, select a room in the tower vs cabana room.",,3.0,2.0,4.0,,,,,,,18

It was apparent she was overwhelmed with the many pool-side partakers and she wasn't too attentive to our needs either.  We ordered a drink that never came.  My friend, brought this to the attention of Alex, the Assistant Tropicana Bar Manager and he was extremely apologetic, but not in the ""let me just say this to make the customer smile"" kinda way... it was real and genuine.  He advised that she was overwhelmed because that particular day they were indeed understaff... he didn't make excuses for the absentminded waitress, but instead, comp'd us a drink of our choice and took two drinks off my friends tab.

SearchGoRu,21,,2016-02-29,BUSINESS,2016-02-17,5,"Amazing Experience, Wonderful Independent Boutique","I've stayed at the Roosevelt Hotel a few times now and there are a few things you should know. 

1. Experience: This place has an amazing, historical ""feel"" with a modern boutique history. Do some research on the type of room you want and (tower or pool side) based on the experience you are going for in a hotel. Tower I stay in for business and the pool when I am looking for a relaxed atmosphere. 

2. Accessibility: If you are the type of traveler who doesn't rent a car or business traveler who uses ride share services to get around, understand this place is very accessible from most LA business areas. I usually come directly from LAX and do business on the west side and downtown. It has never taken more than 45 minutes to get here via Uber or Lyft. I was VERY reticent to stay in a Hollywood property for work but this place is surprisingly accessible. If you are a family traveler, the access to LA tourist hot spots is unbeatable. 

3. Service: The people here are amazing. They are very helpful and accommodating. You will feel like a celebrity (and this is a great Hotel to celeb watch) in any room you are in, but imagine LA Noir (think: the movie LA Confidential) meets modern comfort. 

4. The property: I am a business traveler. I LOVE the fact that I don't have to leave the property to entertain clients (Public Kitchen is a hot spot with an amazing, not overpriced or pretentious wine list) or friends. 24 hour a day food, and having drinks in the main lobby is an experience not to be missed. 

Finally, I know I am hard to please. And point of fact on one of my stays, I didn't like the room I was in. I contacted the manager and he relocated me to another upgraded room. That's service. Of course, you can't expect to be moved all the time, but when someone goes out of their way to help, you win loyalty for life.

We got a great rate here and it is right in the middle of things, so we booked it, even though I wasn't sure how great a place it would be to bring a toddler. I was pleasantly surprised from the minute we handed the keys of our rental minivan to the young valet guy (who looked like he had just come from an audition for ""Surfer Dude on Beach""). Although the vibe at this hotel is young and scene-y, every single member of the staff we encountered was friendly and accommodating.  The valet made sure we had all the stuff my daughter needed out of the car. When checking in, the woman at the front desk made sure we knew what was going on in the hotel during our stay (there was an outdoor concert just for hotel guests happening that night).  When we arrived in our room, there was a special little surprise present for my daughter, and with the crib came little bottles of baby shampoo, baby lotion, and a spout protector for the tub. There are other little details that make Hollywood Roosevelt special, also.  For example, a huge wooden sliding door in the room can be closed to block out any hallway noise.  They put earplugs next to each side of the bed, too, although I have to say that even though the hotel was busy, it was a clean and controlled environment.  We ordered room service in the morning and it arrived within 25 minutes and was actually hot and felt like restaurant-quality, not just eggs thrown on a plate and sent up on a tray. Plus, when we were signing the room service check, the server reminded us that gratuity was included so that we didn't double-tip, which I really appreciated (and absolutely does not happen at every hotel we stay at).  I really can't say enough about this hotel. We have been traveling a lot the past couple of years for family weddings, etc., and this hotel stay just really felt like something special.

My only complaint about the hotel was that my partner had requested a bath in the room.

I think that the reception should have advised us otherwise. I don't think it was fair at all, to put us in a dingy room with no view at all, just  a view of a white roof. We were there for four days and it sadly ruined the experience. If you are asked to take a lower room on booking or arrival, take my advice, don't do it.

The hotel without a doubt has a ton of historical relevance.  Its vintage. Its old Hollywood. Its clearly iconic.  However, its not necessarily for me.

Arrival: The entrance is actually on Orange not Hollywood.  Valet are quick and friendly.

That is where it all went wrong.  The front desk agent told me ""we are giving you a free upgrade to a poolside cabana room.  Room was okay until 7AM the next morning when there was banging and noise happening, as I was right next to the service entrance.  There was not only constant LOUD BANGING from the door hitting the wall but then there were the two way radios that was on the loudest possible setting which echoed throughout the hall all day long.  I was on a  call and the person at the other end asked what that loud banging was and that they were even startled by it.  I phoned the front desk and the agent asked me if I wanted to change rooms.  I declined, as I was there for work and had already unpacked everything.   The next day, I received a note under my door with my room number on the envelope with a note from the General Manager apologizing for the previous day.  

I was waiting for some boxes to come via fed ex.  I called the front desk around 6:30 PM on Tuesday requesting if any packages came for me, ""yes they are here"".  Went to the front desk and they handed me one box and I said is there another box for me.  Without even going back to check ""No that is all"".  The very same front desk agent that said ""we are upgrading you"" from my check in.  These boxes contained items for a meeting on Tuesday morning.   My office tracked the BOXES and they were both received at 12:05PM to the hotel.  No one had notified me that they had come and indeed there were two boxes and not just one.  So Wednesday morning, I phoned the front desk and asked if there were any boxes there for me.  ""Yes, I saw it at 7AM when I started this morning"".  I asked for it to be delivered out to room as soon as possible and 25 minutes later it showed up.

Perhaps the reason that the hotel was such a great deal is because the room was a little dirty (floor and dust) and there was ONLY ONE BATH TOWEL.

As I came and went from the hotel each day (especially in the evening) no one acknowledged me at all, I think because I was not in the 21 - 30 age range.

At least on Thursday morning when I was departing Ozzie Garcia, Doorman/Front Drive was phenomenal.  A celebrity arrived while I was waiting for my car.  He was fantastic because he did not push me aside to take care of a celebrity.  

KUDOS TO OZZIE and the valet that assisted me on my arrival.

I caution you if you are traveling on business and also if you are not within the age range of 21 - 30.",,,1.0,,4.0,,2.0,,,,,5

Upon finding out it was a special occasion they arranged a room upgrade,late check out and champagne on arrival. All very much appreciated. 

The hotel is a Hollywood classic, the decor is from a time lost to today's fast and cheap construction methods and, in my opinion is beautiful.

The rooms are on the smaller side but are very modern and stylish with all the usual mod cons you would expect.

We also thought they left a laundry bag in the room, but it ended up being a $13 tote.

I've stayed in much more expensive hotels, but the way they make you pay for pretty much everything really detracts from what it could be.

jmk5,32,"Moreland Hills, Ohio",2015-12-31,FAMILY,2016-01-30,3,The best part of the hotel was the valet parking and the houskeepers,"I was on a business trip that I combined with taking my son and his best friend to see the new Star Wars movie at the Chinese Theater.  I thought it would be convenient and fun to stay at the classic hotel of Hollywood where the first Academy Awards were held back in '29.

On the hotel, it is in good shape, with the rooms really quite nice.  Since there were the three of us, I got a suite.  The only problem with the room is noise.  And it isn't really a problem with the room; it is more a problem with some of the guests.  They tend to be loud.  Interestingly, the hotel seems to know this since earplugs are supplied.

Another issue is the party scene.  There were definitely some characters there.  One night, there was a pretty big party in the original lobby area.  It was interesting watching it go on as you were walking through, though the only problem is the security was a little overly protective.  They approached one my son's friend and tried to kick him out of the hotel.  Since he was staying there, that was totally inappropriate.  They should have asked him if he was a hotel guest before trying to escort him out.

Also, I emailed a head of time to see about arranging a private tour of Hollywood.  I did not get a response after a month, and I emailed again.  This time I got a email stating if there was anything that the hotel could arrange for us.  Again I replied I would like to arrange a private tour of Hollywood.  Again, no response.  Two days before arriving, I got another email asking us if there was anything that they could arrange from us.  Again I asked for information about a private tour.  Again, no response.  After being checked in for two days, I received another email from this person apologizing for being sick and asking again was there anything that we needed.  I didn't bother to respond.  You would think that someone at the front desk would have handled this.  Because of this bizarre non-service, we did not use any other of the hotel's services.

Two things that really excelled was the valet and housekeeping.  Both were very friendly, efficient, and did their job very well.  I have never brought out valet service as a positive in any review, but they really did a good job at this.",Away from elevator,,3.0,,5.0,3.0,,,,,,39

There's a tv show being filmed in the lobby. Cool, huh? Except that guests can't access the lobby and security keeps you arms length from even walking nearby. But that's ok; I'm sure there was some rate consideration for the inconvenience? Nope. 

And replacing tiles outside the elevator landing. Clearly the middle of the day is prime time for that kind of activity. And finally, in a hotel with only two elevators, let's take one out of use for maintenance during the day. Much much easier to inconvenience those pesky paying guests than to come up with a more expensive solution with the vendor. 

Bottom line: cool building, friendly staff and great location. But the complete absence of guest focus as evidenced by management decisions is world class poor.

We had a ""cabana room"" poolside, with a private terrace facing the pool. The rooms are well equipped with modern interiors and everything you might need. Wake up, open the sliding window door an face the pool embedded in palms. Wonderfull.
We had an very overpriced breakfast in the garden and thats just what i wanted to come to. Be prepared to pay way too much for everything thats not included. But hey! if you want a breakfast poolside at the Roosevelt (little eggs, some toast, thea and muesli) 85.- USD for two, is what it costs. Take it or leave it, theres only one Roosevelt. 
If you are sensitive to noise from the poolside bar, don't book a Cabana. the party is on until around 02.00.

The biggest issue on the negative side is the ""bar"" that isn't really a bar. Understaffed, stressed out bartenders, expensive BAD drinks, a wonderfull furnished lounge that is far too dark and lacking every service it should offer. this spot should really be the heart of the hotel but really is a boring non service area. totally waste of beautiful space I'm afraid.

1) room upgrade since the baby needs extra space
2) tips for every single pickup & drop off (yes, I didn't write wrong) from valet parking
3) we have been told that even customers offer to sign the waiver, the front desk won't heat your baby package even you bring it to them in face, because they don't want to ""touch them""--unless you want to deliver a microwave into your room for another $35.
4) the g level for guest services and valet parking did not have any ramp for stroller. Every time I juggle with a running 2-yr old and the bags, staff from both sides ( guest Serive and valet parking ) just stood there and watching. Only one time a cleaning lady who didn't even speak English well, nicely lift the stroller for me.

Maybe January is quieter but there were no parties at night so that would have not been an issue. The studio I was given was at the 11th floor and overlooked the Chinese and the dolby theatres. Other than the beautiful views, the room was very new (recently refurbished) and quite large (around 50 sqm). The bed is very comfortable. The room is not really soundproof but they give earplugs (free of charge). The room and the hotel are satisfyingly clean. There are several bars and restaurants, one of which is open 24 hours. The staff is generally very courteous. The pool area is very nice but we did not make use of it as it was too cold in the evening. Both the pool and the gym are free of charge.
Now the cons: the parking is quite expensive (42 usd per night) and there is no self parking option. Breakfast is not available in a typical hotel fashion but every morning  they prepare a table with coffee and tea/infusions next to the reception (free of charge). The aspect I liked least is the room being full of items for sale (including slippers, usually available free of charge for guests in other hotels, and other items completely unrelated to a hotel room)... Prices are crazy (10 dollars for a bottle of water). This has a very bad taste imho.
Why 5 stars then? Because I loved the place and would definitely go back and recommend everyone to give it a try.",Cabana rooms can actually be noisier in case of parties.,,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,,,,,44

JFHcambridge,64,"Cambridge, Massachusetts",2016-01-31,BUSINESS,2016-01-19,4,Very Nice Overall...with some small issues.,"I booked through Hotel Tonight about 40 hours before arriving. Upon check-in I asked for a room with a walk-in shower and was given a very nice upgrade to a poolside 2nd-floor cabana room. Sadly, there was some leakage issues with the shower, so the floor was slippery each day. For some reason this did not get resolved during my stay, but the Front Office Manager has been very attentive during follow-up emails.

One other small nit-pick: the bathrobe was not put back in my room on the last maid service. Kind of a drag when you towel off and expect it to be there.

But otherwise it is a very nice property (almost two different hotels – the original ""tower"" and the pool/cabana area behind it) and I would definitely return. A superbly friendly staff and some excellent food, both poolside and in my room.

The location cannot be beat if you want to walk around the Hollywood Boulevard/Walk of Fame area.

One warning: the pool area plays very loud music late on weekend evenings, so be aware of this if booking a cabana room.","The pool area plays very loud music late on weekend evenings, so be aware of this if booking a cabana room.",4.0,4.0,,5.0,,,,,,,9
vo1one,143,,2016-01-31,FAMILY,2016-01-19,4,A classic stay for a first time Hollywood visit,"Let me preface this review with the fact that I obtained this stay, as I often do, at a discounted rate by utilizing a ""hot"" opaque booking site.  For those of you unfamiliar with what this means, in exchange for paying about 60% less than the price on other sites, I did not know that I was booking this hotel until I payed for it up front (although helpful hints allowed me to surmise with relatively high confidence it was indeed the Roosevelt).  I also was not afforded the opportunity to choose room type.  This is of no fault of the hotel and should not be taken as such, that's just the name of the opaque game.  The property can stick you in any room they choose in exchange for the discounted rate and will often put you in one next to the elevator (louder) or one that's slightly smaller than normal due to an adjacent storage room.  My stay at the Roosevelt was no exception to this and that's fine with me.  

My wife and I, along with our two year old daughter, came to stay at the Roosevelt to explore Hollywood and the area for a day after vacationing farther up the coast.  The hotel is very conveniently located on the Walk of Fame and is as close as you can stay to the Chinese Theatre.  We parked underground at Hollywood & Highland (entrance on Orange) for $15 for a day.  It was a short walk from the mall across the street to the hotel.  However, when we arrived in the Hollywood Blvd entrance, the lobby was being blocked off with large black fabric barriers and there was a flurry of activity with workers obviously setting up for a huge event.  I felt a little out of place there with two large suitcases, two backpacks and a stroller!  I asked someone if they could direct me to check in.  I was told the lobby was closed due to an event but another employee was given permission to guide us to the elevator to take us down a level to where check in was.  We were then told that we should use the south entrance for the duration of the event.  This was a little inconvenient as not only is it the farthest entrance from Hollywood Blvd, but there are some steps which must be alighted in order to exit which does require some assistance with the stroller!  This entrance is however where the $42/day valet is located.  

At check-in, we were greeted with a warm and hospitable welcome by a young woman whose arm was adorned by a tattoo seemingly covered up with makeup.  I say this only as an identifying feature because I do not recall her name, definitely not because I was offended by her appearance.  I would feel bad if it was management that had suggested she needed to hide her body art.  She asked how our day was, if we had any plans, asked about our daughter and related by mentioning her own young child.  I felt it was a nice establishment of rapport not commonly seen anymore.  She offered a crib to be sent up at no additional charge which was appreciated.  She also mentioned that the event closing the lobby was the annual party for the employees.  I hope she was able to attend at some point!  She took my drivers licence and a credit card (for a $150 incidentals authorization hold) to complete the check-in.  

Our room was a Superior King located on the 10th floor near the elevators, next to the supply closet.  The room was wonderfully decorated and had a very comfortable bed, but it was a bit on the small side.  The window actually opens up a few inches and provided a good view of Hollywood Blvd....and the window at the end of the hall next to the elevator!  Definitely keep the drapes closed in this room if you're not decent!  We struggled to find room for our suitcases.  We settled on turning a bench sideways and putting one under the table, and the other was small enough to fit in the closet with our backpacks.  There's a safe there for your valuables.  The mini bar was one of the best stocked I've ever seen!  Small bottles, big bottles, mixers, the works.  This did not come without a price, though.  JD priced like an XO Cognac!  That shouldn't be of any surprise to anyone whose seen a mini bar before, though.  Room service is also available for a price.  The refrigerator was also fully stocked, unfortunately leaving little room to keep your own things in there, like milk for our toddler.  On top there was also a tray with things like M&Ms, nuts, protein bars, and other various snack items.  Picking up these items you could blow a cloud of dust off of them.  Left on the tray were plenty of dust bunnies who probably hadn't seen the light of day in some time.  

There were lots of things placed throughout the room with price tags on them.  Bottles of water, $6.  Flip flops on each side of the bed wrapped in plastic, a bag that resembles those reusable ones you get from the grocery store but had the HR logo emblazoned on it, a hat, you could even purchase the bathrobe if you wanted, but a tag said to ask housekeeping for a new one instead.  There were several complimentary items, though, such as a pen, notepad, two sets of earplugs, cotton swabs, q-tips, lotion, shampoo and conditioner.  There was also a hair dryer and iron to use.  

The bathroom was a little dated.  The tub floor had a crack open up in it.  It also had a couple small hairs in it, but otherwise clean.  The bathroom floor looked like something was spilled on it but was probably just the clear coat worn off over decades of use.  The bathroom door had a grate at the bottom with approximately half inch square holes in it.  Our daughter liked walking up to it, bending over, putting her fingers through the holes and looking through at us using the toilet/shower.  The rest of the room was clean.  There were two small brown stains on the rug but no big deal.  The rug outside the room in the hall was in much worse shape.  The (faux?) wood floor looked like its fair share of suitcases had been rolled across it.  

Our crib arrived and was about as wide as the entranceway.  It was nicely done up with fresh sheets, a pillow, a Winnie the Pooh blanket, and a small bag of amenities such as baby powder, lotion and a rubber duckie!  I can't recall ever receiving anything like that before and was definitely a nice and appreciated touch.  However, it was difficult to find a place for it in the room.  We ended up moving the chair from the corner to right beside the bed against the end table and with some lifting and creative maneuvering we were able to put the crib in the corner where the chair was.   

We had a pretty good sleep.  I woke up a couple of times, nothing unusual for me, and noticed the sounds of the elevator but it was still pretty quiet and didn't necessitate the use of ear plugs.  I was surprised at out quiet the street was for being a Friday night.  The doors also must close pretty quietly unlike some hotels where all you hear all night are the slamming of doors.  The bed was great.  The TV was a nice size and actually had HD channels and a guide.  One of the channels had some drop outs but it was one of the better hotel CATV distribution setups that I've witnessed.  

Check out was a breeze as we were prepaid.  We were able to finally see the lobby.  There's a photosphere of it on Google Maps should you wish to get a good look at it.  It's quite nice, actually.  We were able to leave out the front door to walk back to the car, although we would've appreciated a doorman to assist as we were fully loaded.  

Now, comfortably back at home and recovered from jet lag, I receive an automated email from the Roosevelt asking me to complete a quick survey about my stay.  The link takes me to a page by Revinate that curiously looks like a TripAdvisor user review form with the addition of a few extra questions.  Upon further investigation, I discover that the survey is indeed a TripAdvisor review and is marketed as a way for hotels to increase the amount of completed reviews on TripAdvisor by over 400%.  So instead of filling this out, I thought I'd come right here to TripAdvsior and put all my thoughts down here.  

So, to summarize my characteristically long review -- 
Service - Tops!  Could use a doorman, though.  I expect it at this caliber of hotel.  Lobby closure, and therefore Hollywood Blvd entrance closure was an inconvenience, but not a demerit in the service we received from the employees we encountered.
Cleanliness - Could use a little work, but still quite good.
Location - If you want to stay IN Hollywood, can't get much better than this.  That being said, there's only so much IN Hollywood.  If you want to get out and see the rest of LA you're going to have to jump in your car and drive.  It's not like Manhattan where you can ditch the car and take the subway everywhere.
Value - I got a good discount and I'd have to say at that price I found it to be of average value.  Paying the regular rate I would've found to be absurd but perhaps the location commands a price premium higher than I've seen even in places like Manhattan and Singapore.  

I think it was a nice stay for our first visit to Hollywood.  If we ever come back for a visit, I'd be hesitant at staying here again as our interests lead us to driving throughout the city and beyond rather than just in Hollywood and if we're going to be driving anyway, might as well base ourselves somewhere that's a better value to do so.  It's just hard for me to justify the location price premium if we're going to be headed elsewhere most of the time.  That's more personal preference than anything and not much the hotel could do about that other than lower their price, which given the history, class and location I doubt they're eager to do.  But I don't regret staying there for my first time and if you can stomach the price, I don't think you will either.",,3.0,5.0,,,,4.0,,,,,129
Thalia F,35,"London, United Kingdom",2015-12-31,SOLO,2016-01-19,3,"Fab hotel, but not on movie premiere nights","I booked this hotel based on its history and the beautiful photos I saw on Tripadvisor and the hotel's website, as well as it's location right on Hollywood Boulevard.

The hotel IS lovely and my room was enormous, and I even had a view of the LA skyline and a bit of Hollywood Boulevard.  Ripleys Believe It Or Not, Madame Tussauds and the Max Factor Hollywood Museum are right there, including cinemas like El Capitan and Graumans.  Brilliant location!

However, unfortunately I arrived in LA and at the hotel on the day of the Star Wars movie premiere.  Two blocks of Hollywood Blvd were blocked off for the event, including the area right in front of the Hollywood Roosevelt.  I came out of the nearest Metro station surrounded by barriers, police and scanning equipment, and had my backpack searched twice before I even reached my hotel.  The policeman even wanted me to open my suitcase right there on the pavement so he could search that too, but I told him to sod off and went on my way.  This bagsearching and even frisking would continue for the rest of the day - every single time I wanted to leave the hotel to go somewhere touristy (Ripleys Believe It Or Not) or even Macdonalds.  As the day progressed more roads were closed and eventually I ended up having to walk miles out of my way and down dark alleys just to eventually get to the hotel's back entrance. And even then a policeman was on hand to, yes, search the bag and frisk some more.  Very very very annoying.

That night I didn't sleep at all as the noise from the Star Wars thing was so very loud (the party seemed to be in a tent that had been put up in the street itself).  And the next morning the police were gone, but the barricades closing off the road/pavements were still there because the premiere things had to be taken down.

On my second night I discovered that another premiere was on, and that the party was IN my hotel.  So again, no sleep due to the noise coming up from downstairs.  I also, again, found myself being forced to enter via the back entrance and being grilled by burly security personnel as to why I was walking into the hotel. I even had to present my room key and some ID.  I wasn't allowed to go anywhere near the restaurants or bar area either, so had to leave again to find a meal elsewhere, only to later, for a second time, be grilled by security at the back door again.

On my third night there was yet another premiere, this time blocking off a chunk of Hollywood Boulevard again, causing detours from and to my hotel again.  

Needless to say, I moved to a different hotel the next day.  Love the Hollywood Roosevelt, but I was made to feel so unwelcome (despite paying a small fortune to stay there!!), that I will think very long and hard about staying there again.",Find out what premieres are on in the area.

Donna A,5,"San Francisco, California",2016-01-31,FAMILY,2016-01-18,3,Historic Hollywood Hotel in need of help!,"I recently stayed at the historic Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel last week.  The building common areas and bars thankfully remain true to the glory days of old Hollywood.  The staff was fabulous and we had a delicious meal in the main restaurant. 

My big complaint are the room interiors and lack of amenities.  First of all, my room, #7735 was small and the furniture too big for the space.  None of the furniture matched.  There was no chest of drawers only a last minute  attempt with an Ikea type stark white open bookshelf which had nothing to do with the rest of the dark furniture in the room.  There were hardly any electrical outlets.  I had to unplug the clock next to the bed to plug in my charger and the other plugs were used or behind desks or draperies.  The desk was cover (35%) with hotel snacks, hats and tee-shirts for sale.
The bed frames were too large for the mattress and have several bruises on my legs from knocking into the bed frames.

The bathroom had few amenities and to turn on the shower you had go behind a stationary glass stationary fixed panal on the tub to turn on the water and hope that the shower didn't turn on with your head inside.

Unfortunately we were unaware that the 
IPOP convention was being held there so our first night was very noisy and the downstairs area had been cordoned off for their dinner.  Trying to get the lift to our room took over 20 minutes.  
I think the hotel have a responsibility to advise guests that events like this are happening prior to booking/arrival not when you check in.  I had to ask guests several times in the hallway to please keep the noise down.  Our second night was much better.
Having said that our stay was wonderful, the rooms are beautifully designed and decorated, everything is very well styled and the mini bar is full of lots of treats. 
The hotel is very well located, almost directly opposite the Dolby Theatre and the TCL Theatre with a short walk up to Highland and Vine to view the Hollywood sign.
My one and only complaint would be the cost of parking - at $42 per night it's outrageously expensive but apparently parking in LA is pretty much the same everywhere.  We did see a sign nearby for $10 but I'm not sure your car would be safe ?

It was our first time in such an elegant place!!!  Ozzy at the front door said hi to us every morning, James at the help desk gave us maps and restaurant suggestions.

Michael F,21,,2015-12-31,COUPLES,2016-01-10,5,Special Experience,"We planned a trip to Hollywood over the New Years holiday. We came to see one of Motley Crue's final shows and do some touristy Hollywood stuff. We choose the Roosevelt after looking through the many hotels offered in the area. The hotel is a wonderful place. This boutique is also a Hollywood landmark and has a great variety of decors and themes. You truly never know what to expect as you turn each corner of the hotel. From old fashioned bowling alleys to Library themed bars to a beautiful pool area. We even got a private tour of the Penthouse Suite and the famous roof top area. We stayed in the King Size room and loved it. The room was small, but it was also furnished just right to make it work for both sleeping and living.

I have been an Airline Pilot for 30 years and I have seen my fair share of terrible places and also my share of 5 Stars properties. I have to say that this hotel provided the nicest experience I have ever had. Our customer relations contact was Bre Smith. Bre is the Director of Guest Relations and she went over and above all expectations to make our stay the best we have ever had. She helped us plan a New Years Eve experience we will remember forever. Book a private tour of the ""stars"" homes and was very generous with gratis drinks and hotel activities. She is wonderful and gracious host and a definite asset to the Hollywood Roosevelt.

We will be coming back....

denfaria,7,"Wembley, United Kingdom",2015-10-31,NONE,2016-01-03,4,Best Location.,"We travel a fair bit, but this being our first time in L A, we opted for The Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel, mainly because of its location - which really cannot be beaten – right on Hollywood Boulevard, amidst all of Hollywood’s  famous landmarks.
For anyone who has looked it up, The Hollywood Roosevelt has a whole lot of Hollywood history, which in itself means a lot and is very exciting for movie goers alike.   To just imagine all those famous names and stars that have stayed and played in Roosevelt rooms – the very room you may be in tonight – and had been prancing around and getting into mischief, is to give one a gentle tinge and a glow, as you think of what might have been. 
Being at the epicentre, we loved the location.  This famous hotel is approaching its 90th year and with a style of its own, and one has to understand any lacking in modernity.   However, the hotel has been refurbished, and the rooms are newly painted and very clean.  The bed in our room was very comfortable, and room cleaning was regular and very good.
However, from our first night, we found the Superior Queen Room to be very small and tight.  And when I complained about this the next morning – and I did consider moving to another hotel – a very sweet young receptionist, Jodi, asked me to reconsider, and offered to move us to a Superior King Room, which she did: The King was not a whole lot bigger but the offer/move/upgrade did mean, to us, that there are good employees like Jodi, at The Hollywood Roosevelt, who, apart from looking after the hotel’s revenues by ensuring that clients stay, do also want to help make your stay at the hotel a happy and good experience, and we thank her for that.

Whether it was thIe lovely doormen helping me book an Uber and helping me drag my broken suitcase around, to the helpful room service staff and to the friendly and informative front desk staff.
I’d most of all like to commend Bre Smith your Director Of Guest Relations. She had seen one of my many Roosevelt posts on Instagram (and there have been a few I have been staying with you for many years and refuse to stay anywhere else in LA) and she kindly suggested I contact her next time I stay. Not only did she help me secure my booking I was so surprised to arrive to a room upgrade with the most incredible view and a handwritten letter. As a female that always travels alone, it was so lovely to have someone acknowledge my arrival and to make me feel so incredibly welcome.
I travelled to America from Australia because I was a bridesmaid in New York. I couldn’t possibly travel all that way and not visit my beloved Roosevelt so I spent my first and last day in LA. It was so worth the long extra flight. All the fresh renovations look great too. I love your hotel, love your staff and it will forever be my home away from home.

The service we received from Kayla Snyder (Front Desk Manager) and Bre Smith (Director of Guest Relations) was exemplary. We stayed in room 1001 which had a massive double bed and huge separate dining room (6 chair dining table) and 4 seat leather chesterfield sofa bed for my daughter, which was made up each night. The room is on the corner of Hollywood Blvd and N. Orange Dr which has the best views of the Chinese Theater all the street action, Hollywood sign, Runyon Canyon (do that too!) and downtown L.A. The bathroom is not huge but big enough and again, the view from the shower  window is so cool. The toiletries were of a very high standard. I stay at many of the top chain hotels for business but if you want something different, cooler and with heaps of history -Marilyn, Montgomery Clift, Clark Gable & Carole Lombard to name a few all lived at The Hollywood Roosevelt at some stage through their careers and the first Academy Awards were also held there. The 25 Degrees bar/dinner serves a great breakfast and the best burgers (Thanks Jesse, Ron and the boys for our Christmas breakfast- you were all very professional in light of the crush of hotel guests and visitors. The Public Kitchen & Bar is also highly worth a visit. The pasta meals, pork and mash dish we all shared were perfect. Although unseasonably cool last week in L.A. we managed to sit by the pool in the brief sunning periods and have a few nice lunches from the Tropicana Bar (seen in the movies Entourage, Catch me if you Can and others..). The pool is heated and even in winter, a must to try. We also had some cocktails at The Spare Room mid week which had a great buzz. If you want a Hollywood experience, stay here.

We were then kept awake til the early hours of the morning with party goers so loud it felt like they were in our room.

From check-in to checkout, we were treated with the utmost sincerity. Being new to the USA the ladies at reception went above and beyond making us feel welcome and comfortable. The we stayed in a Superior King room which was cool and furnished in accordance with the rest of the hotel theme. I hear a lot of people complain about the room being smallish but it didn't really detract from our time there as we were really only ever in the room to sleep and shower/change. The mini bar was stocked well, bit on the expensive side compared to what I am used to in Australia, but seemed on par with other places we stayed in the US.

The location put us in walking distance of all the things we wanted to see and do, and being so close to the metro (railway station) was an advantage too.

The receptionist was lovely and friendly and gave us directions to downtown etc. The room was nice and modern.
However thats where the pros end, the room despite being modern was tiny and the equivalent of a uni room (that small!) the bath room wasn't that nice and you could use the toilet, shower and sink all at the same time. You can also hear alot of noise in the rooms coming from the Blvd and from the people next door, the walls seem paper thin
Alot of the hotels facities seemed to be closed like the pool and the bowling alley for what i can assume was private celeb parties.
The hotel had valet only parking which was very very expensive, after the first night we went across that road to the multi story and parked for 5 nights for the same price of one in the hotel.

The bars in the hotel are full of A list Hollywood celebs, so if you a movie buff keep your eyes peeled. There are often long lines to enter the bars, particularly for the pool bar. The nice thing about staying at the hotel is you can jump to the front of the queue - fantastic! If you are party animal, you NEED to go to the pool bar, although you may never leave. I have never seen so many string bikini's in one place before.

For it's age, the hotel is in good shape and has been well maintained. 

Word of caution if you are travelling with children. This is a busy hotel, and is at the heart of Hollywood, which attracts some rather interesting characters. On one occasion I was surprised (others may be excited) to find a young naked couple who couldn't quite wait an extra 60 seconds before ""getting down to business"" and were ""warming up"" in the elevator. Also, there is a constant smell of marijuana, although it is California, so no surprises there.

Elaine C,89,"Pinehurst, North Carolina",2015-12-31,BUSINESS,2015-12-15,3,"Great location, but lacking in other areas","My stay here was just a weekend while shooting a commercial.  I brought a friend along to keep me company.  Our limo driver dropped us off at the side entrance right next to a wonderful restaurant within the hotel.  The floors are confusing and so was getting to the front desk.  We learned we actually came in through the back that is on Hollywood Blvd.  We had to go down one floor to check in.

After checking in, we were off to our room to freshen up and get back down to the restaurant as we were way past lunch time!  Going back down was a bit confusing as well.  

Once we had lunch, we headed back to the room for a quick nap before our meet and greet that evening.  We were warned by our limo driver not to go out at night.

So the next day, after the shoot, we decided to explore a little bit of Hollywood Blvd and found a nice Sushi restaurant mixed in with several shops, a bar and a couple other restaurants and all this is just a block and a half from the hotel.

The hotel itself is old and shows it's age.  The beds were comfortable as were the sheets except that the wooden bed frame sticks out quite a bit on the sides and ends and we both kept hitting our legs on them.  

We had a nice room but it was very noisy each night, well into the morning hours.  Friday night they had 10 separate events all over the hotel grounds.  Saturday night they had several that took up all of the pool area and we couldn't get out to the Tropicana bar to hang out because the whole area was closed off for parties.

If I weren't so tired and wanting to go back to the room I'd have been very angry about not being able to use the facilities that I paid for by staying at this hotel.

I wouldn't ever be able to put my elderly clients there because it isn't very user friendly for anyone who has a walking issue or in a wheelchair.  They would have to always use the back entrance and get in/out on one of the busiest streets in Hollywood!  Not too good.  Anyone who wants to party at any of the venues on property better check before making reservations to see how many private parties are going on and where they're going to be located.

All in all, it was ok, but I don't think I'd go back to stay there again.",Try to get one NOT on the side where the valet and parking lot is (&#39;front&#39; of the hotel).,,3.0,4.0,,3.0,,,,,,63

And if there are events on at the hotel (a Volvo party by the pool when we stayed) be prepared to hear every single thing from even the 6th floor until they turn the music off.

Lovely pool area (where Monroe had her first photoshoot in Hollywood). 

The bars are beautifully themed, though the 25 Degrees restaurant is dinghy. The bar service is a little slow though, they probably need more staff especially in the cocktail bars. 

The WiFi is VERY expensive-though on the right side of the hotel you can get the free use of the coffee shop opposite! The backpacker hostel nearby offers free WiFi, so this feels greedy.

I would absolutely recommend the Roosevelt to anyone wanting to explore Hollywood and West Hollywood.

Based on the positive reviews posted here  and also given that the rate I was given on booking.com was less than half of where I intended to stay, I thought I should give it a try.
Happily it was a lovely experience. 
I was given a Studio King which overlooked partly a small outdoor sports stadium, parking lot and residential area. The room had been recently renovated with a very modern and comfortable four poster bed, a huge bathroom and a shower that could of accommodated a football team. The windows in the room actually opened which was a joy so that I could turn off the noisy air conditioning.
Overall the room was quiet minus the AC, very nicely appointed and very comfortable.

Mishap #2) called for extra pillows/blanket for the sofa bed. 2 hours later had to call again and finally received it.
Mishap #3) Strange little tablet looking clock started screeching at 5am. When you barely fall asleep at 2am on vacation then being rudely awakened at 5am and not being able to go back to sleep will definitely ruin your day. Housekeeping should shut off previous customer's alarms esp on strange devices. I couldn't figure out how to turn off the alarm setting so just pulled out the batteries instead.

As we were unloading the car, a couple liters of soda fell out and sprayed all over myself and the very helpful bellman, Rocco. Instead of being super irritated, (like I was) Rocco kept his composure and still did the best he could to help us unload the rest of the car. He graciously accepted the only cash we had at the time which as $2, with a smile on his face.
Then, when we were checking in, Millie, was so sweet and kind. She noticed my friend dressed up with a tiara on her head and surprised us with a room upgrade with no extra charge. It made everything that had just happened before worth the stickiness of my hair and clothes. I felt I could ask for anything, and she would somehow deliver.
Will, the bellman who brought up our luggage was very accommodating as well. He completely understood when we didn't have cash for a tip, and knew we would take care of him later. He even participated in one of our bachelorette games later on in the evening without hesitation.
We ordered room service as well, and the person taking our order wanted to make sure we were completely taken care of, which was extremely nice when we were just ordering some fries and mac and cheese.

Overall, we had a great time at the hotel, and were treated like Hollywood royalty. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting from out of town or someone just wanting to get away for a bit and still be close to home.",,5.0,5.0,,,,5.0,Reservations T,The Hollywood Roosevelt Reservations Team,2015-11-25,"Dear michelle_pag05,

I tried to volunteer this advise to the manager but the waitress said she could not locate him. This actually made sense since the entire service feels like there's no grown up in charge. The food is pricey, the portions are minute and the personnel is young, cute and therefore inexperienced or simply uninterested in ensuring you would come back. Stay away from the Vegetarian Cobb Salad; it is a $17 side dish that won't last you more than 5 minutes.

Some of the things I like about it:
-The rooms are good.
-The pool is heated and very nice. If you want to do laps or work out in it, it will be empty around 6 pm (it always was empty at this time during my stay).
-The location is excellent (more on this later).
-The food at 25º is awesome.

The staff is simply amazing! I do not have lots of requests, but every time I had a question or needed something the staff was great!

The only thing you might not like related to the location is that sometimes they have festivals or events and that gets in your way. For instance, in my last visit I was not allowed to go thru the lobby at night because a festival was happening at the time. It was very annoying for me, but you might run into someone famous if you're into that.

I do have to say that the staff was better on my first visit, they even personally emailed me before my arrival asking for any requests and even gave me some treats.

Lost my clutch so I called back that same night and described the ""clutch"" the security confirmed he had it and even opened it and confirmed what I had inside. I told him I'd be there first thing in the morning but when I went nobody could find it. Finally after all the hassle they figured out they only some stuff I had inside the clutch which was confusing because when I called the security had the entire thing. Turns out they took advantage and took what they wanted knowing my clutch was worth more than $500. Security is placed to help ensure safety of their guest not to rob or take advantage of. Typical Hollywood, I wouldn't recommend this hotel to any one, I'm from Los Angeles and they took advantage. I could only imagine what they do to foreigners or out of town visitors. What's worse is I called and spoke to the ""assistant director of security"" so he claimed, and explained what happened and he said he would look into it and call me back. Never did, never received a follow up call or even an apology. From someone who works in the industry of hospitality in the same city, I've never been so disappointed. Horrible service and security.

He apologized that someone had informed you that we had a clutch turned in, however it was not yours. We did receive your call in the very early AM and the team jumped on tape footage right away. We pride ourselves on customer safety and ensuring that all lost and found items are returned to security immediately. I would be happy to discuss this with you in greater detail if you would like as I know our housekeeping team never picked up a clutch from the restroom that you left it in based on the video footage. We also watched the tapes to see if we could locate anyone walking out with your clutch however, we did not find anything based on the description you provided. I am glad to hear that we were able to return your phone, keys and other items that were inside your bag.

Looking forward to connecting,

essexkittycat,135,"London, United Kingdom",2015-11-30,COUPLES,2015-11-11,4,Good for the location,"This was the first stop on our honeymoon. We arrived and used the valet parking. There is no reason to use the valet parking as over the road is a multi-storey. The valet parking is $37.50 and the multi-storey is $20 a day. 

We were checked in by Adam who was so friendly and helpful. We were initially upgraded to a king room no.1226. It was on the 12th floor and had incredible views. However, the noise in the room was so loud. We called the front desk and someone came up and agreed it was coming from the ceiling and so we asked to move. We moved to 707 which was a lot better although the room was smaller.

The bathroom in 707 was small and the toilet space was very small. The aircon is very loud and you couldn't sleep with it on so bare that in mind if you want to book this hotel in the height of summer.

The location in Hollywood is really central with the Chinese Theatre opposite and they had a premiere there one evening. Hollywood doesn't really get going till 11am and there aren't many places around that offer breakfast before this. Although this hotel is good except the loud aircon I wouldn't stay in Hollywood again. Santa Monica has a lot more going on.

The 25 degree bar does amazing breakfasts and burgers. Ron was always happy and friendly. There was great service at the bar except when we had a blonde waitress who seemed flustered even when it wasn't busy and wasn't very polite to us.

The service here is simply first class and literally begins with the kind and welcoming greeting by the Valet staff. Once we entered we were graciously led to the front desk where we met with Marlon Deroche, a fine gentlemen who efficiently, and effectively checked us in and then directed the bellman to our home away from home. 

Our 1 bedroom suite was spacious, tastefully, and elegantly furnished and designed. My wife and I particularly loved the black out shades, which admittedly are essential after a late night of celebrating. The halls are adorned with great classic photographs that document the early days of the paparazzi. The Brigitte Bardot image and story revealing how the image was captured remains my favorite. Can you blame a fella?

The exquisite charm of the hotel is enhanced further by Los Angeles's most beautiful people occupying the numerous and varied lounges offered within the hotel grounds. It's almost as if they have been cast and the costume designer elected to dress all in high fashion form fitting, short, and revealing attire. It's quite the scene. Enjoy thoroughly with cocktails in hand. 

Bre Smith worked hard to insure that all aspects of our trip were flawless, and she succeeded in every area without exception.

On this occasion I stayed in a garden cabana but perhaps next time I'll spend the extra money on a poolside cabana or maybe stay back in the main tower as I did on my first visit. Noise from guest wasn't an issue, however our cabana (132) was located behind the bar which was sometimes noisy when they re-stocked the bar, especially relatively early in the morning. Still, it wasn't all that bad.
Check in by Bre and her staff was quick and easy and they were able to provide a room despite the early arrival (8:00 am) which was a blessing. The poolside bar staff were also great with Raul especially memorable for his excellent customer service and stories.

At this point I'd like to add that we were travelling with our 11 year son.  

Upon arrival we were advised of a Halloween Party taking place in the hotel (pool area) on the Saturday night. Unfortunately we'd chosen a cabana room due to it's proximity to the pool but were told that it would be closed for half of our stay due to this private party.  If we did wish to use a pool we were allowed to use another hotel across the street but was never given the hotel name.  

We were offered an alternative room in the Tower rather than our Cabana room but was advised to give our room a chance.......Big mistake.  Even without this private event we were woken nightly due to other drunken guests shouting whilst trying to locate their rooms.

Luckily we'd decided months in advance to treat our son to Halloween at Disneyland and now planned to stay away from the hotel until late.
Unfortunately after sitting in Hollywood traffic for what seemed hours we finally arrived back at the Hollywood Roosevelt at about 02:00 only to be barred from entering the valet parking.  We showed our hotel room key as proof that we were guests and were only allowed entry after a twenty minute argument with security and having management finally come out to deal with the situation. To rub salt into the wounds we were told that staff should've given us a special ticket, as if we were to know that.

Had my husband & I travelled alone and were a few years younger this hotel would've been fantastic.  Although guests weren't permitted to attend the Halloween party unless they had a ticket.  How one was to come across a ticket two days before the event is beyond me.

Our room was clean and tidy and had all the amenities you'd expect and staff were friendly.  

Unfortunately I can't and won't recommend this hotel.  For those who wish to make your own mind up please double check for any private events that may be taking place if you value your sleep.

It's a pity as the Hollywood Roosevelt is a lovely hotel.",,,4.0,1.0,4.0,,,Kayla S,Manager,2015-12-06,"Dear Zoe A.,

Wow, what a hotel.

By far the most luxurious hotel that we had booked. Located opposite the Wax Museum and the Chinese Theatre right in the hear of Hollywood Boulevard.

The hotel just oozed old world charm.

Looking from my room you can also get a great view of the Hollywood sign.

The hotel room I received was large and well equipped fora disabled access room.

Only hiccup was the lifts that were not the quickest. Also, each evening they tended to block access to one of the lifts as it seemed to be reserved for the guests heading to the penthouse.

As soon as we pulled up in our royal blue Super Save shuttle we were treated with the same attention and curtsy as the car previous to us in the BMW.  The Manager ran over to welcome us to the Roosevelt Hollywood Hotel and helped us check in. As you enter into through the doors you feel like you have entered into a time machine. From the dark ambiance of the lobby you can’t help but feel the old Hollywood presence and expect Marilyn Monroe to grace the stair case.  The hotel is peacefully quite almost too quiet that the guest do not want to disturb the ghost the supposedly room the halls.  You can walk the hotels to only imagine the greats of Hollywood that use to once fill the lobby.  We check in with ease and were informed off all the wonderful amenities that the hotels has to offer. Delicious burgers -I would recommend the #4, that you can order 24 hours, restaurants, and the nostalgic courtyard pool that you could lounge around all day and feel like a movie star. I wish I could comment more on the beautiful pool side but our trip was too short and we just didn’t have time to appreciate it.

Our room was comfortable and cozy.  The designer, Dodd Mitchell, seem to preserve the old charm of the hotel and refined from making any modern renovations to the rooms.  The rooms still had the narrow door frame entrances that was originally designed for the suite.  For me I prefer to have the original structure of a building to get the same sense of what the previous guest experienced at the hotels crescendo. The room is tastefully decorated with classic furniture replicas from the 1960’s and a few modern flares that resembles something from the pages of a Restoration Hardware catalog.  There was the usual hotel trinkets.  Bathrobes, flip-flops, baseball hat to purchase for a pretty penny but hey the ear plugs are free.  The fridge is stocked with premium alcohol, plus assorted mixes, and the basic necessities you need for your bathroom (soap, shampoo, conditioner and moisturizer…the basic no frills).  The bed was comfortable and by being on the 12th floor we heard very little noise at night. 

The hotel is centrally located by everything Hollywood.  For Pete’s sake its right across the street from the Doby Theater where the Oscars take place.  You can walk the sidewalks that are glittered with Hollywood stars and    you may recognize a few famous landmarks that you would only see in movies.

I could write a novel on my experience at the Hollywood Roosevelt so give you the Coles notes. The hotel and staff are great.  It’s in walking distance to the Hollywood Bowl and Runyon Canyon which you cannot ask for more when you are wanting the Hollywood experience. My only negative is that the Starbucks is hidden in the Doby theater shopping complex and is not on every street corner.",,,5.0,,5.0,5.0,,Reservations T,The Hollywood Roosevelt Res Team,2015-11-04,"Hi JAK_604,

anniedutch13,236,,2015-10-31,COUPLES,2015-10-31,4,An accurate review of an old historic hotel...mostly a great experience...,"We chose this hotel because we had a concert to attend at the Dolby Theater. You cannot beat the location. Paid for valet parking and parking runs about $40 for overnight. Considering San Francisco does the same thing for an area with limited parking we were not surprised.

 The hotel is very old and charming. We meandered our way thru hallways to get to our room at ground level and our patio sliding door opened out to the pool. There was a massage bed outside of our patio doors. Room was clean and spacious. Bed was one of those beds sort of ""hippie"" low to the floor. Bathroom was either really old so maybe that is what impressed us that maybe the baseboard area could use some additional cleaning attention. We used to have a small hotel for years and we were super picky that housekeeping cleaned those areas of the floor. 

Toilets old and low to the floor. There was a refrigerator in the room. Ear plugs were provided. Good air conditioner. Learning to turn on the lights on and off a bit of a learning curve. TV easy to operate. 

For almost $400 a night with parking I was disappointed with the bathroom amenities.  Tiny square bar of soap and basic shampoo and conditioner. C'mon guys...a shower cap would have been awesome. I purposefully left mine at home since of course a fancy hotel like this would provide a shower cap.

We went to bed really late after the concert and then eating in their restaurant 25 Degrees. The next morning you could hear everything out in the hallway. Rooms not super sound proof.

Pool/bar area is ""happening"" and looked like a lot of fun. Packed with people.

nushkino,3,"London, United Kingdom",2015-10-31,NONE,2015-10-27,5,"Over exceeded my expectations with a totally cool hip vibe, perfect for solo traveller","I never take the time to write reviews, but I feel compelled to do so about the Hotel Roosevelt. Even before I arrived, I had to arrange for a delivery to be received on my behalf. I called ahead and spoke to Adam who arranged for my package to be kept safe until my check in 48 hours later. This allowed me to hit the floor running with my jam-packed schedule. 

After what was 24 hours of travel from London, I arrived shattered but I was greeted with a lovely warm welcome. As a solo traveller, I had stayed it the area before but at an Airbnb. I wanted a different experience this trip around so chose the Roosevelt for it's central location. As as non-driver I get around LA on the Metro which is 2 mins away (Hollywood/Highland) and Uber. 

I hung out at the pool in the mornings and the vibe is so chilled, I was always welcomed warmly by Kai who did a great job of making me feel welcome. It's always harder when you are on your own anywhere but every day it was like saying hi to someone who had my back. Ha I rocked up to chill by the pool dressed to the nines in a glittering sari as I waited for my Uber to arrive. Kai and the team were on hand with lovely chit chat to fill the time and help me to blend in (ha ha) 

Sean on concierge was ace when on the first night I lost a filling, he was on hand to help me speak to the front desk team to help me with treatment options. (It worked out great as there's a CVS across the road that is open until 00:00 everyday!

Jeremy on the main entrance was awesome when it came to receiving my Uber's and offered fab advice about places to check out in LA.

I also have to namecheck Sebastian who managed the excellent team. It's a testament to the brilliant team, many of whom I have named. It goes to show how excellent my time was there and the commitment offered by a fabulous team of doers! 

I had my reservations about the Roosevelt, I thought it was going to be old and stuffy. It completely exceeded my expectations as a cool, fun and buzzing place to stay in the heart of Hollywood. It is perfect if you are there on your own like I was or as a group of friends. I wouldn't hesitate to go back or recommend it to my friends. The room was lovely with fab views of the hills and Hollywood Boulevard.

sparklesque,259,"Plymouth, Michigan",2015-10-31,COUPLES,2015-10-26,3,"Fun Hotel, stayed in room 928","I stayed 2 nights recently and it was over all a fun stay. This was my 2nd stay at this hotel and I stay in the ""haunted room 928"" as I requested on my reservation. I was hoping for something ghostly to happen, but it really didn't. The light in the bathroom would go on for no reason, but we found it was the sensor tripping it on when there was motion by the nightstand,  and it was resolved by closing the bathroom door at night. 
One really bad thing was there was a dirty lipstick stained glass left in the bathroom sink for us- gross.  I didn't trust any glass as being clean in the room after that.
The bed was comfortable and the room was very pretty with plenty of room for the bed foot-end couch.  The shower head sucked and it essentially misted water on you, and it was hard to rinse my hair of shampoo with it.  We had a gift sent to us of champagne and fruit, and the fruit was really good- very sweet strawberries.  
The hotel had an IMDB party going on and we saw Seth Rogan arrive, so that was exciting. The hotel is in the heart of Hollywood and it's a party hotel, so there are lots of comings and goings of people, and a good chance to see a celebrity.
We walked to Runyan Canyon, and I'd highly recommend the hike, it exceeded my expectations and was quite difficult at times.  We took a Uber car to drop us off at the Hollyridge trailhead and walked behind the Hollywood sign, and that was a great hike too. We took the Uber car because there's no parking in the Hollywoodland sub on the weekends, and you must get to the trailhead via the sub. It's such tight quarters there anyway I'd recommend taking a car service so you don't have to deal with parking and annoying the people who live there.
We didn't eat at Public, but we did eat 3 times at 25 degrees. Breakfast was bit expensive, but fantastic. We ate there for lunch snacks the other times and each time was great.   The green juice was really good too.
One big disappointment was that the hotel didn't have a hospitality room. A hotel that tries to be fancy should act fancy and offer this when requested. We had a day of hiking on our check out day and had to leave our bags at the front bellman, and then were dirty. They should offer a room to use for 30 minutes to freshen up like nice hotels do. I should mention that they leave earplugs in the room for you, but I found the room to be very quiet.
They get an average rating instead of 4 stars because of the glass incident.",9th floor is supposed to be haunted. I&#39;ve stayed in 928 twice and never experience anything.,,3.0,,,4.0,4.0,Kayla S,Manager,2015-11-16,"Dear Sparklesque,
Thank you so much for your feedback. I am so happy to hear you enjoyed room 928. It is one of my favorite rooms as it has so much light pouring in from the outside. The Great thing about the hotel is its location which allows for celebrity sightings as well as its location to lots of great hiking trails. I am so glad you got to experience Runyon Canyon! I hoe to welcome you back in the future to try some other rooms and get you over to Griffith Park for some hiking!

We chose this hotel mainly for its location (close to the Chinese Theater and to the metro line), but it was also significantly cheaper than many other offers we had looked at. We had read a lot of good reviews but also that it could get a little noisy at times, so we asked for a quiet room in advance and we got a quiet room.

The hotel turned out a true gem. It has an amazing 20ies interior (entry hall and lobby) and the rooms have a nice style to them too, even though they are more modern. Everything was clean and well maintained. The hotel fashions several restaurants, a great cocktail bar and an amazing pool area in the very center of Hollywood.

Perhaps the best part is the staff: Everybody was extremely helpful and friendly. They made our stay very special, way beyond what we ecpexted.

In my view, they have managed to perfectly blend the renovations of their hotel into it's existing form - leaving you with the full feel of this historic hotel but with a very clean refreshed feel.  It really is nothing short of incredible, so many hotels do not get the balance right.

We stayed in a King Suite in the tower, which was huge and had great views of LA and Hollywood.  Every single member of staff we spoke to was knowledgeable, polite and eager to please.  Poolside was great and the barmen really knew how to make a drink.

In addition to all of the above, it was a particularly special occasion for us, as I proposed to my girlfriend during our stay.  Bre (Director of Guest Relations) helped me get champagne and roses dropped into the room on the evening, which was done without a hitch - she is an asset to the hotel in her own right made the stay extra-special.

I stayed in a Studio King which had a great bed, heaps of room, a study desk to plan your day, a bar fridge, but no tea/coffee making facilities. As a tea drinker that was initially a bit annoying, but there are cheap drinks at Starbucks across the road, plus complimentary tea & Coffe on the ground floor 6-9 am. Problem solved. Great bathroom and walk in robe.

Staff are helpful and helped out with my tour needs, even printing out a Google Map route for my trip to The Briad (see my review on this for more lowdown). There are guest computers and a printer for making a copy of your boarding pass.

The hotel has a gym which was a bit tired looking (not as good as my last hotel in San Diego), but I still was able to do my daily workout. There is a great pool and bar nearby (not my scene though); watch out for other guests putting drinks on your bill. When I checked out the concierge said I had two cocktails for 34 USD! I did not use the pool or the bar, so just as well I asked for the detail.

There is a 7/11 and laundromat a few blocks south on Sunset if you want a few supplies. Handy since there is no guest laundry or shop. You can buy sandwiches and snacks from Starbucks, and other things like candy from La La Land across the road. 

There are stacks of attractions nearby for convenience. No shortage of things to do. The subway 'Highland Station' is 5 min away. Don't ride it at night; I had a scary ride at 8pm on the way to Downtown.

Neil B,16,"London, United Kingdom",2015-10-31,COUPLES,2015-10-16,2,A Fading Hollywood Star,"If you want a hotel that is quiet enough to sleep in, do not stay in the Roosevelt. The ear plugs by the bed should have been a big enough clue to the constant hum of traffic, sirens and music that will keep you awake all night. Our cabana room was small and dingy and overlooked a garden that was smaller than a stamp. When we complained we were upgraded to a nice room on the 10th floor but the location of the hotel has ruined our stay in LA. 
Service in the hotel isn't much better. Be careful of the overpriced charge for wi-fi ($14 per day - who charges for this anymore?), we got back to our room at 16.00 and it still wasn't made up, the telephone didn't work so we had to walk down to give our room service order, our towels weren't changed and were damp, $6 for s bottle of Evian water and on and on. 
The hotel has lots of history but unfortunately has not kept up with the times. It is dark, dingy and in need of a total upgrade. I still have two more nights in the Roosevelt but my partner has decided to move to another hotel which sums it all up. So disappointed with our stay which was the start of our trip. Hopefully this has been the low point and the only way is up from here. I will never come back here again.",Pick another hotel,,2.0,1.0,,,2.0,,,,,24

It is an amazing hotel located on Hollywood Boulevard opposite the Chinese Theatre. The Tropicana bar and pool are outstanding with luxurious white towels on comfy loungers. We experienced a pool party during our stay which was amazing. We drank in the 25 Degree bar every day at Happy Hour and enjoyed night caps in the Library Bar. The only negative comment is the room size and cleanliness. We had to phone for clean towels and ask for the bin to be emptied. The beds were made but the bathroom was not cleaned once during our stay. It was a Superior room but was tiny. On our last day a cot was brought in before we had checked out and we struggled to get our suitcases out of the room.

Jacob F,29,"New York City, New York",2015-10-31,COUPLES,2015-10-14,5,Didn't Want To Leave!,"Just came home from an AMAZING 4 night stay in one of the poolside cabana rooms. These rooms are brilliant as they overlook the pool, have balconies, etc. The balcony was great as it allowed us our own private space for room service dining while still being in the pool atmosphere. The staff is very helpful and polite, from Ozzy at the valet organising our luggage to the room as we were checking in, to the front desk staff, house-keeping and food service staff, nothing but smiling helpful faces. The front desk worked day and night to get us reservations at a really exclusive booked out restaurant, even though they warned us it would be very unlikely, their tenacity in trying was really appreciated.

You've also got a choice of 10 bars and restaurants within the hotel itself: 25 degrees has a banging breakfast sandwich that we got room service to deliver to us poolside one morning. The tropicana cafe's fried chicken sandwich and croque madame were delicious when washed down with a mimosa. And the concept of the Library Bar is an interesting one: No menu, you just tell the mixologist what kind of drink you want (e.g. sweet, with vodka, a bit tangy) and he comes over a few minutes later with a personalised cocktail and explains everything he's done to make it... So cool!

You might even see a celebrity or two... We saw a fairly famous British actress lounging by the pool, but everyone was pretty cool and just let her relax and enjoy herself.

Also, best pool time for relaxing is 8am-10am. Free coffee and tea, and only a few guests around. By 11am the pool area gets busy when the cafe and bar open...They reserve the pool loungers for exclusive use by hotel guests, so you'll definitely get a seat...but it's just a bit more enjoyable in the mornings.

All in all, this hotel is in a great location as a starting point for exploring LA. You step out the front door and you're in the heart of Hollywood with plenty to do and see on foot. Or you can spend most of your time by the pool like we did and completely forget that you're in the middle of the city!

Worth noting, the area around the pool is essentially a nightclub.

We were offered a free upgrade at checkin to a cabana room next to the pool, but declined as heard from previous reviews that area is particularly noisy during the night.

Huge lobby area, which was lively during the day with Hollywood types mixing with holiday makers as well as few hotel bars made for great atmosphere.

Our room was lovely, 4 poster bed, hardwood floors and spacious bathroom.

Pool area is nice, plenty of drinks flowing and was relaxing considering the location of the hotel.

Due to the location however there is quite a bit of noise from outside traffic during the night and ear plugs are supplied next to bed.

If you want to be right in the middle of the action then this hotel is the place to be.

However you need a decent sleep, somewhere a little quieter we'd say stay in West Hollywood (only 5 mins away) and just Uber around, which we found the best way to get from place to place.",,,,,,,,Bre S,Director of Guest Relations,2015-10-22,"lovely_stuff1 ,

Our room was right next to the lifts so it was quite noisy, although not as bad as traffic noise so I slept through it OK.  We couldn't keep the aircon on though as it was ridiculously noisy!  Luckily room temp was really fine so we were comfortable enough without the aircon.
Compared to other hotels we stayed at during our trip, you don't get anything complimentary here.  Everything was for sale and was pricey. We didn't even contemplate using anything from the minibar.
Having said all that the food in the restaurant was excellent, the pool and poolside service was excellent (although the pool could do with being a degree or two warmer).
My biggest complain was that wifi was only free in the lobby.  Not even by the pool, but especially not in your bedroom where it would be most useful.  This was the first hotel we experienced this and it was a bit frustrating as I wasn't prepared to pay $14.99 a day to use it.
Overall though we enjoyed our stay here.  I wouldn't necessarily stay again, but only because it is right on Hollywood Boulevard and it's noisy and chaotic.  If and when we return to LA we will stay in a quieter area.",Avoid a room near the lifts!,,4.0,3.0,,,3.0,kmcb225,Manager,2015-10-22,"Hi,

We booked at the Hotel Figueroa about a month in advance and specifically told them we were booking because of the pool and atmosphere. We were assured even if they couldn't get our room ready in time, we could go to the pool and lounge. When we got there to check in I asked if we could start by the pool until our room was ready. They told me the hotel had been booked for a private event and we were not allowed to use any public areas. When I told them the ONLY reason we were staying with them was the pool I got a lady at the desk with a look that said someone more important had booked. I asked why they didn't tell me ahead of time so I could choose another hotel, she said she thought they had and maybe I should look through my emails again. Which I did not have. She did not help with anything except the refund she was hesitant to give me. I had to sit in their lobby on my phone calling around to find another hotel last minute.
 Here's the good part of the story. I called the Roosevelt, which I have stayed at before, I told them my dilemma and the man on the phone said he could totally help. He said to come over and we would work everything out. We pulled up and went to the front desk, who had a room ready and waiting on a high floor, and at the same price as the previous hotel. They had reserved a bed for us by the pool to make sure we would have the girl's trip we were looking for. Within minutes we were lounging by the pool, drink in hand, DJ playing amazing music, and wondering why we would have ever thought another hotel would be better than the Roosevelt.

You definitely feel like you're in an iconic location, but it's not stuffy or pretentious.  I was worried that I'd feel really out of place and unwelcomed, but the staff was incredibly friendly and approachable.  The only place we dared not go was the pool.  Since it was Labor Day weekend, they had a huge pool party going on and we're just a little too old and not pretty enough to attend such an event.  Well, at least that's how we felt.  It wasn't like someone denied us entry.  Anyhow, the pool looked great, but we never went near it.  

The lobby is pretty spectacular.  We had a drink at the lobby bar (Public Kitchen & Bar) - very laid back and good drinks.  We looooooved the Library Bar, which was located off of the lobby.  It's really small and intimate with limited seating.  There is no menu because they create cocktails based on the flavors you enjoy.  We loved our cocktails and the overall experience.  We also had dinner at 25 Degrees.  The food was really really good, but it was incredibly crowded when we dined there and our seating situation was very cramped and almost uncomfortable.

When we arrived there was someone to greet us with our bags and show us to check in, which was quick and easy. they explained things going on in the hotel and where stuff was.

We were offered an upgrade to a suite for $50 per night. - would totally recommend doing this! Our suite was amazing, and could see the hollywood sign from the bedroom and living area window! Also had a great view of the hollywood boulevard (where the Chinese theatre and stars in the pavement are).

We used the room service one evening and the food was fantastic and didn't take long to arrive at all.

Also used the fitness centre - not huge but had everything we could need.

The pool area was amazing, towels were provided and the staff there were again really friendly and helpful. 

The location of this hotel could not have been better, especially for us just having 2 nights in hollywood. We found nice places to eat and things to do just steps away from the hotel! (Definitely recommend visiting the El Capitan theatre - it shows old Disney films!)

It has been totally remodeled and it is very boutique like now.  With that said, it wasn't the most practical room I've been in.  I did like the décor, however it was very small.  The bathroom shower had only a half solid glass wall on the tub and didn't close, so needless to say the water did get on the bathroom floor.  There is only one towel bar with no hooks or places to hang towels.  There were no dressers to put your clothes and the closet was so small we could only open on suitcase in there.  The bathroom shampoo, conditioner and lotion were nice however the smell wasn't to my liking.  Unfortunately there are no views to speak of in this entire hotel due to location.  You can get free wifi in the lobby, but in the rooms it was an extra $19 a day.  It took the staff all day to clean the rooms and replace towels as well, which was difficult for us due to an afternoon formal event we had to attend.  On the up side, the hotel is grand and the beds are oh so comfy!!  The restaurant of choice was 25 degrees, and it was fantastic food!!

Aggie C,68,"Melbourne, Australia",2015-09-30,COUPLES,2015-09-28,4,Can still feel the old Hollywood glam,"My husband and I were visiting the US and hadn't booked accommodation for the second leg of our trip. I found a wonderful deal on the Roosevelt website that included room, parking and $100 food/beverage credit. On booking it gave me the option to share on facebook for the further $50 food/beverage credit.
We booked a pool cabana room and I had no real expectations on arriving. I was so pleasantly surprised. The hotel although in a heavy tourist area felt like a little haven. I was glad we picked the pool cabana. The view of the pool, the Hotel Roosevelt sign were just great. Watching people frolick in the pool was entertaining. I loved having room service breakfast every morning on our balcony over looking the pool.
One thing to note is that these rooms are loud. You get the noise from the pool area in the evening especially over the weekend and also in the morning from people by the pool who must still be deaf from clubbing the night before and cant hear how loud they are. However the hotel supplies ear plugs and they did a treat in letting us get sleep every night. Being in a pool cabana was worth having to wear the ear plugs.
Food wise we found the room service menu had a great offering of healthy food choices. Everything we had was delicious. One night we also went to the Public Bar fro happy hour and enjoyed a few beverages along with their happy hour bar menu.....the meatballs were amazing as was the pate. That entrance foyer where the bar is was a beautiful place to sit and observe the bits I'm guessing of the original hotel foyer.
My only negative was the shower.  It was a trickle and hard to regulate the water pressure, however I was able to turn a blind eye because I was enjoying everything else.
On check out we had a slight issue reconciling the $150 credit against the account.  This took a while but in the end the hotel whipped some of the other fees and the whole thing ended in our favour which we obviously appreciated.  I most appreciated that I didn't have to be one of those rude and obnoxious guests for it to happen.  They just did it because their was a glitch in their system and they didn't want me to have to wait any longer (great service).
Also if you join their rewards program you will get free internet during your stay otherwise you will have to pay.
I would most definitely stay here again.  I loved the vibe and how they have managed to retain that old Hollywood glam!","Suspect for a quiet room you would need to select the tower.

Jordanblackpool,41,,2015-09-30,COUPLES,2015-09-26,5,Amazing. ,"Wow. Where do I start?

Located centrally on the Hollywood walk of fame you cannot get any closer to the action. When we arrived the staff were brilliant, we had a long day travelling and their welcome put us right at ease and gave us a complimentary upgrade! 

The room was brilliant - a giant four poster bed with an amazing view of downtown LA and an even bigger TV (which does show English Premier League football ). The bathrooms are huge aswell. We were blown away! 

The pool at the hotel is such a cool place - it's not the cheapest but the surroundings and atmosphere make up for that. We couldn't have been closer to Hollywood but you don't feel it at the pool, so if you want to get away from the Hollywood hassle then this is the place. 

You also have a very cool little bar (which name escapes me) but it's got a bowling alley in and they make some incredible cocktails. 

Brie and the team made us feel so welcome, we would definitely recommend the Roosevelt to anyone wanting to visit Hollywood.

debs,54,,2015-09-30,FRIENDS,2015-09-22,4,Great hotel...with a few things to note.,"This hotel is gorgeous, old architecture...which is hard to find in LA. A beautiful throwback to the mid-century (and prior) style. It's in the heart of touristy Hollywood. If you're looking to be right on the Walk of Fame and across from Grauman's Chinese Theatre...this is perfect for you. However, if you'd rather something quieter, with less foot and car traffic, this is not for you.

Some of the things I loved were the decor, the beautiful building, the extremely friendly and helpful staff, the incredibly comfortable bed. The pool area was gorgeous, although the pool on Saturday was too crowded to get a chair. The food was great, but crazy expensive. One example is $12 for a bottled juice. It said carrot/ginger on the menu...I expected just carrot and ginger. But it was filled with other juices I didn't want, and the bottle said 29% juice. Which meant I just paid $12 for 71% water.

A few of the big negatives for me were the music playing all night at the pool, hardwood floors and no counter space in the bathroom. First the music at the pool. They play it till 2:00am and it's loud. They do have earplugs on the nightstand, and after that first night...I knew why. I should note too that I was in a tower room on the 10th floor, I was not even pool side. And it was loud. The decor of the rooms was beautiful and interesting, but I just don't like hardwood floors in a hotel...it doesn't feel cozy to me. And the bathroom is small with only a sink, no counter space at all. I want to note also that there is NO dresser to put your clothes in. At least not in my room. There was only a small cubby with 2 open shelves. The only reason this didn't bother me was because I was there for only 2 nights so I didn't unpack. If I was there for more and wanted to unpack my things, there would have been no place to put them.

Overall this is a gorgeous hotel, very comfortable bed, excellent service and friendly staff. And a tip...the fitness center is impossible to find unless you go through double doors that say ""cabanas & Tropicana restaurant"". Not sure why it doesn't say fitness room also...I was afraid to go through those doors until I asked, because I thought I was walking into the restaurants. My suggestion to the hotel is to add Fitness Center to the door, I was frustrated with trying to find it. Once I got there, it was nice.",Tower rooms will hear less pool music all night than the poolside rooms.,3.0,5.0,,,,4.0,Reservations T,The Hollywood Roosevelt Reservations Team,2015-10-13,"Dear Dmazor,

I still needed to firm up some of the bachelorette weekend details so I called the hotel and was lucky to be transferred to Bre the amazing Guest relations manager!! To begin our weekend off right she got us early check-in and even reserved us 4 pool chairs very close to the room! Saturday was a dedicated pool day for us and it can be quite difficult to secure a chair if you are not there very early! 
Then she proceeded to help us plan the rest of the evening setting up an amazing charcuterie and cheese platter, room decorations and a few bottles of grey goose! Our evening plans were still a bit uncertain post dinner and she was able to get us a comped table at the nearby Warwick so we could all go dancing! If you know LA, then you know it is not easy getting a table for 17 women day of! It was so perfect! 
We had booked a beautiful poolside room so after the Warwick several of us went back to the Roosevelt to hang out at the Tropicana Bar. DJ was great and still a lot of people dancing and lounging. Fun vibe!

Loved the hotel itself and staff were really helpful and pleasant.  The room on 9th floor was fab, clean and spacious and i was thankful not to be near the pool in a Cabana suite as the area became crowded and noisy with parties held til late on weekends.    One annoyance is that still in this day and age when most hotels provide guests with wi-fi in the rooms.. this one doesn't unless you pay a considerable charge.  Also no tea and coffee facilities in rooms only near reception so you have to go help yourself get your first coffee of the day.   We had chosen this hotel to relax around the pool before a long flight home.  But on the two days we had to do this, the maintenance carried out  non essential maintenance near the pool with  a jack hammer all morning on a Sunday .. which wasn't a good relaxing experience and caused me a major headache.  The next day they rearranged all the pool furniture to cater for a conference which was a bit annoying again and hotel guests were limited to a few sun beds near the bar.  This being said, it is a great hotel but you do feel they could do a bit better and not lose the focus on everyday guests to cater for the many functions they have here.",,,4.0,,4.0,4.0,,mderoche,Manager,2015-10-08,"Hello,, Thank you for your recent stay with us and taking the time to give us feedback!

The Roosevelt is a very old hotel and it has been completely redone. The bones of this hotel are very good.  It is a great solid old building.  The lobby kept the original style and grace of this hotel.  The staff was wonderful and caring.  However, the decorating style was modern, very stark.  We paid for a upgraded room and that was a mistake because if that was an upgrade a regular room would have been fine.  No pay per view on the television or in-room checkout. Very strange for being in the land of movies and entertainment.  The room was comfortable but strange.  Only two drinking glasses could be found in the honor bar, which was actually a  very cool honor bar. The rooms should have been decorated in the style of the rest of the hotel.  It was loud at night as we faced the pool area but they actually provided ear plugs next to each side of the bed so they have heard that complaint before. I was disappointed and I guess I expected it to be more grand.  I usually don't care about the decorating in a hotel at all but this was just wrong. The hallways were just like the gray of a naval destroyer!  Will stay somewhere else next time.

Kim H,76,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",2015-09-30,COUPLES,2015-09-20,2,So many negatives!  Wanted to like...  ,"Room type booked not available.  
Pool bar area smelly and filthy.  Need to hose down nightly with bleach to get rid of horrid odor that carries over to the seats by the pool. Tons of dirty dishes on bar.
No full room service menu on Sunday nights .  Hotel fully booked yet food selection limited to ""after 11 menu"" - at 8 pm - fail to mention on menu or at check in.
4 tiny non plush pillows on King beds.
Cabana rooms not all pool view, which is probably okay for some, but why pay to upgrade if no view?  
Pool scene, very young, loud and obnoxious.  Again smelly pool bar.

Not the experience that we expected.  But some younger, less travelled, obviously enjoy.   Just not what we wanted.  Touristy and rather tacky.   If one is 21 - 30, and wanting a cheesy pool party, then it's great.  Seasoned travelers with a level of sophistication and high service expectations will be disappointed.

We should have known better!

The room we were given was on the 6th floor with a view of the back of the sign and the air con units, The room was small and the bathroom even smaller. There was dirty brown scum around the bathroom door frame so we asked at reception if they would send someone to clean it we went out for a few hours to come back and find it had not been done so another call to reception then housekeeping before someone came to clean it. We've stayed in 18 different hotel across America over the last 3 weeks and this was the only one we felt letdown with and was one of the most expensive of our trip we would not stay here again",,,,,,,,Bre S,Director of Guest Relations,2015-10-22,"Thank you for your feedback.

shoequeeen,44,"Ingatestone, United Kingdom",2015-09-30,FAMILY,2015-09-19,3,Style over substance,"I love historic hotels, especially of this period, and the exterior, bar and restaurant area and huge roof-top neon sign fit the bill. The staff and friendly and very helpful. The location is right on Hollywood Blvd which is great. The pool area is small but very lovely with a great bar area too. What let it down was the actual accommodation; a cabana is a covered poolside or beachside area and we booked cabana rooms. We had garden cabanas which in our mind sounded like they would lead into a garden area;  what they actually were was a small fenced in patio area with no view of a garden just bamboo planted either side for greenery and a high fence at the back. Ugly to say the least. I did not complain because to be honest the staff seem to believe they work in a fantastic hotel and would not really get that our idea of a cabana is not the same as the hotels' and we had enough of a mix up when checking in and getting our rooms as it was. The staff were gracious and dealt with it all very professionally but I do believe they are on a different wavelength. The whole hotel was shabby, even our rooms which I believe were fairly newly renovated and re-styled; they were stylish but very poorly lit, the seating was beneath the TV (bizarre) and the lovely wooden floors were terribly marked. No information in the rooms as to TV channels, how to work the lighting system (though this was fairly obvious) or hotel information, not overly comfortable beds (though lovely and large), no fridge, dusty glass on all the lights and dust along the edges of tiling in the bathroom. The hotel wanted to charge for wifi but in the end gave it to us complimentary. (Of the five hotels on our trip this was the only one that wanted to charge.) As this was the end of our trip it was disappointing but I guess as the rest was so good it doesn't really matter and, of course, the location of this hotel is hard to beat if you want Hollywood Blvd on your doorstep.

Sindierella,4,"Covina, California",2015-08-31,FRIENDS,2015-09-18,5,Royalty Treatment,"This is by far one of the best experiences I've had at a hotel. We rented a 1-bedroom suite here for my birthday, as what better way than to celebrate in a classic old Hollywood fashion. The rate was definitely comparable to other hotels, given that this is considered a boutique, classic old-Hollywood hotel. 

The service was impeccable from the moment I left my car at the valet, to the beautiful and tasty birthday gift in my room, and even until now.. a month after I've visited the Roosevelt. To explain, I fell in love with their Davines' toiletries and was not able to find the body lotion anywhere. After a long search, I've come to learn that this is a product exclusive to the Roosevelt. I contacted them with my odd request in hopes to purchase some and they were amazing enough to send me some because I'm a loyal guest.

JDS,8,"Leicester, United Kingdom",2015-09-30,COUPLES,2015-09-17,5,A fantastic choice to spend out Honeymoon,"Well where do I start.. Being our honeymoon I wanted to make sure that my wife and I received the best service and the hotel did not disappoint. A few weeks before our arrival we were contacted by Bre Smith (Director of Guest Relations), introducing herself as the POC for anything we needed. As this was our first time in LA and with so much to do/see and with little time, Bre was kind enough to send us list of things to do while in LA. She was very efficient in arranging our trips and always got back in to us within a reasonable time when we had any questions. We were very happy with this.

Our room was a very good size, the bed big and comfortable there was a walk-in closest with safe and enough clothes space for us both, we were facing the pool which was fine as assumed facing Hollywood Blvd may have been a bit noisier. I would recommend this especially if you wanted to relax after a long day sight-seeing. As a personal touch, we received a nice card from Bre along with a framed photo from our wedding and Strawberries dipped in Chocolate.

The hotel itself has a wealth of history to it and would suggest going to the Spare Bar, on the Mezzanine floor, the staff at Bar 25 Degrees were friendly and the food was good. The sides should be shared based on the size of the portion.

Location wise, the hotel is on the Hollywood walk of Fame, Madame Tussaud, Ripley's Believe it or Not, The Chinese Theater and various shops restaurants which we visited between our day-trips. We did the 'obligatory' Celebrity Homes Tour, or Driver (arranged through the hotel) David took us on a detour, on the way back from picking us up from Santa Monica Beach, he was very enthusiastic gentleman and it was a pleasure for us to be shown around be him. I would defiantly recommnend using him if you fancy a more personal tour around LA. 

Overall it was a lovely hotel choice and couldnt ask for anything more.",,,5.0,,5.0,,5.0,Reservations T,The Hollywood Roosevelt Reservations Team,2015-09-18,"Dear Jesal S,

gary188177,23,,2015-09-30,COUPLES,2015-09-16,5,AMAZING PERIOD!!!,"To say I'm surprised at this property is an understatement as I wouldn't  normally select a hotel on the tourist strip. 

In saying this, the main valet and hotel entrance is on Orange Street and both the entrance, hotel and rooms are super quiet.

I truly didn't expect to be impressed with this property as it is so well known and kind of expected it to be a tourist trap, I was presently surprised it takes itself seriously.

I booked this property simply because most 4 & 5 star hotels on the dates we were in LA were sold out.

From the minute we arrived until we checked out we found every staff member exceptionally professional and genuinely friendly. In particular two staff were standouts. Patrick one of the pool attendants. The perfect way to describe him is a gentle soul so helpful and couldn't do enough for us. He must NEVER leave!

Another was Jodie at the front desk who was both helpful, chatty and willing to go out of her way.

The rooms are all renovated and the standard king room is like a junior suite. The bathroom and shower is also very large, bright and clean.

The only small thing at a stretch to complain about is wi-fi should be complimentary for hotel guests. I'd rather they incorporated $5 in the room rate so you at least feel it's a fully covered stay for international guests. As I said it's a stretch and overall this property is impeccable.

Dave J,84,"Sheffield, United Kingdom",2015-09-30,COUPLES,2015-09-15,4,Classic hotel in a great location,"Had a great stay at the Hollywood Roosevelt. The hotel itself has tons of character, with the lobby in particular being a throwback to the 1930s. We had a deluxe king room, which was of a decent size for a hotel of this age, with a comfortable four-poster bed, large cable TV and huge shower. We had a great view of the Hollywood sign and down Hollywood Bvld, and were high enough for there not to be any street noise. For these prices however, wifi in the room should be complementary. The hotel location is obviously excellent, and a short drive to the Hollywood hills or Dodger Stadium. The valets were very friendly and quick. 

The pool was pretty good, with some comfortable loungers and sunshades. There was “chill out” background music that blocked out the street noise without being too loud. We were a little surprised to discover that topless bathing was allowed – we didn’t mind but it may bother some people. We were a little irritated at being hassled by the waitress every 5 minutes until we finally ordered something – apparently the pool is considered part of the bar and not the hotel, which is a little disappointing considering the price of the rooms. 

We didn't bother with any of the restaurants as there is such a good variety close-by, but the attached bar had any excellent range of craft beers.",High up and away from the pool,,5.0,,,5.0,5.0,Reservations T,The Hollywood Roosevelt Reservations Team,2015-09-17,"Dear davidjones533,

spalover30,29,,2015-09-30,SOLO,2015-09-14,3,Service Needs Charm School,"This is my second visit to the Roosevelt.  I love the property and the history.  The room I had this time had a view of both downtown L.A. and the beautiful pool.  The windows open a little to let fresh Cali air in.  My room felt like an adorable apartment.  I loved.  I also like the quaint features with the old wood and the little closets.  Just cool things you will find only in an old hotel.  The burger bar 25 Degrees is fun and the food is delish.  Drinks are yummy throughout. This time I tried the little mixology bar.  All good, just pricey but that's expected and no worries.
Here's what's bugging me: service.  I am spoiled in Vegas with amazing hospitality employees everywhere I go.  But time after time in this one night visit I was taken aback by the service.  I can't say it was terrible...but it wasn't good either!  
Upon arrival at the valet there were four valet hosts and only one car they were attaining to.  I sat for minutes without a greeting.  Then I finally got out and was like, ""Should I just leave it here?"" and they're like, ""Are you with the wedding?""  Ummm.  How about sorry for the wait or welcome to our property?  This is a $400 a night place.  This lack of appropriate welcoming would not fly in Vegas.  Then I check in and want an espresso.  I ask the front desk. They suggest the restaurant.  O.K.. As I approach there is a huge wedding going on in the entire lobby.  One security guy stops me and I have to explain what I'm doing.  Again, $400 a night.  So I wheel on past to get my espresso and am again stopped by a staffer and have to explain and she suggests I exit a different way.  The wedding was over and it was photo time. Put up screens if not other guests may be seen!  I already went through TSA- I don't need all these questions about getting a flippin espresso.  
The next day at the pool same lack of service.  I approach and three staffer stare at me without a greeting.  I'm like, ""I'm going to the pool"".  One says, ""I need to check you in.""  Me...""Need my room key??""  Like every interaction needs to be facilitated by the guest. Not what I'm used to.  So bizarre. Before I left the pool I wanted hot water for tea in my room.  I ask the pool bar and the bartender says they used to have hot water but can't find it.  While he is searching a waiter keeps repeating to me, ""What is the problem?""  over and over.  I was so confused.  I cannot imagine hospitality workers speaking like this.
When I left to leave the hotel and get my car at the valet, the valet guy is like, ""Did you call down?"" basically mad.  I'm like, ""No...""  In my world, this exchange usually goes along the lines of, ""Hi! How was your stay?  We will get your car right up here for you!"".  Mind you there were no other patrons waiting for their car.  
I am never treated with such a lack.  This hotel has a price point that warrants a higher level of service.  I know the pool parties attract the younger crowd, but they are not really the people staying there.  This is a worldy crowd and a middle aged crowd really.  People form every corner of the world.  I'm pretty sure most of us know excellent service and this sloppy protocol didn't fly with me.  I guess I'd go back, but I would consult a manager at any point the service lacked again.",,3.0,2.0,,4.0,,,Kayla S,Manager,2015-12-06,"Hi spalover30,

There is a metro station within 2 minutes walk and many restaurants nearby. You can take bus tours just beside the hotel. The building itself is interesting, the room was big and nicely decorated. The bed was comfortable. The bathroom is small but fonctional. The minibar had the most diverse selection we've ever seen in a hotel room. Staff was very helpful and professional. There is a computer with a printer at the front desk and complimentary wifi in the lobby. 

The downsides : the hotel hosts many receptions (conventions, weddings, private parties) that block some parts of the lobby and sometimes make the pool not accessible for guests. One night, one of the 2 elevators was stricly reserved for private party guests. Even with 2 elevators you often have to wait some time to get into one. We were on the 12th floor and one night there was a party in the penthouse on top of us. The music was very loud till late. We could ear it even with earplugs (which are conveniently offered by the hotel). We asked the front desk if there was going to be other parties in the penthouse during our stay. Next day, we received coupons for free breakfast and drinks with their apologies for the noise.

There is a great open space with a balcony. Off of the lobby there is a series a beautiful restaurants and bars including the library, the public kitchen and the spare room. We visited all but the library which is rather small and was crowded on a Saturday night. The spare room is very interesting because it contains a bowling alley with two lanes. Up to six players can play for an hour for $100. Instead of bowling in the spare room we decided to have cocktails which were expertly made by very serious and attentive mixologists.
We stayed in one of the suites, having been upgraded, which was on the corner of the building facing Grauman theater. Except for some cars which seem to drag race at three or four in the morning it was quiet despite the busy street scene.
The suite had a living room/conference area with a pullout couch. There were two televisions in the suite.
We spent some time at the pool given the hot conditions prevailing. I need Tropicana for lunch which was very delicious and enjoyed lounging poolside for great people watching.

Wifi is not free as indicated on Tripadvisor, but instead is only free in the communal areas and not in the rooms.

When checking out we asked the girl at reception if we could store our bags while we did some sightseeing around the area.

ColinandJane,819,"Worcester, United Kingdom",2015-09-30,FAMILY,2015-09-11,5,Disappointing & Fantastic,"We booked four nights in a pool side Cabana for a relaxing end to a 16 day road trip for Janes xxth birthday.  Less than a week to go (having booked six months previously) we were advised that due to a last minute issue the rooms and pool would be unavailable till after the 2nd night so we were upgraded to a suite in the Tower.  

This seemed good but when we arrived there were details of ""Nightswim"" on Tuesday nights - which didn't look like a last minute issue as it was claimed to be ""one of LA longest running and most loved pool parties."" 

Anyway the suite was rather special with a clear view down Hollywood Blvd, the Chinese Theatre and the Hollywood sign so we were happy.

After a very hot tour we fancied a dip in the pool which was closed so we asked about the promised alternatives.  This turned out to be at the Loews across the block.  As we had booked poolside rooms and were now expected to make our own way there it was time to voice our displeasure.  

On the front desk Millie and Jodi sorted a taxi, payment, towels plus some compensation. They also wrote a very nice handwritten note in apology and said we were to speak to them with any further issues.  We consider this going above and beyond so are to be praised for this. Thank you.

When the Cabanas were ready the bags were moved while we were out so that was one less hassle to deal with.

The Cabana rooms were as nice as expected although the noise from the corridor (not carpeted), the close proximity to the main door to the rooms and noisy guests at 2am did mean a bad nights sleep.

Mention should also be made to Charisse in the Tropicana who was extremely friendly and helpful. Thank you to you too.

The Roosevelt is a special place but the ""misinformation"" about the reason for the rooms being unavailable, plus minor issues like marked tiles in the bathroom, a shower that didn't work properly, a four poster bed that obscured the TV screen, clocks not set to the correct time added to the disappointment while on their own would have barely been of note.

Would we stay here again? No. Would we recommend it? Maybe.",,,,,,,,Reservations T,The Hollywood Roosevelt Reservations Team,2015-11-27,"Dear ColinandJane,

Shirley G,8,"Brisbane, Australia",2015-08-31,FAMILY,2015-09-08,5,Heaven on Earth at the Roosevelt,"Our family of four stayed at this glorious hotel for four nights in August 2015. The interior of the hotel is breathtakingly beautiful, especially the lobby. It is laden with ""old Hollywood"" yet has been painstakingly renovated to an excellent standard and one can imagine all of the famous stars over the century congregating there for the first Oscars and ""after parties"" to this day. The pool area was elegant and fringed with soaring palm trees and bungalows including room 229 where Marilyn Monroe herself lived happily for two years back in the day. The service is attentive, efficient but wonderfully unobtrusive. The rooms are cool and luxurious with the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in. The location is perfect, right on Hollywood Blvd, and a short stroll from the red line train which is two stops from Universal Studios. You can negotiate a good tour of Beverly Hills etc from vendors on the Blvd right outside the front door of the hotel. It truly is a magical, ethereal hotel with an air of youth and excitement. The actor Zach Galifianakis (Birdman and the Hangover movie franchise) was having a drink in the lobby when we were there and was fine about having his photo taken. Our youngest was thrilled later to discover the entire Buzzfeed web team having their weekly meeting in one of the conference rooms. I have stayed in top hotels all over the world including the Raffles and I cannot recommend the Roosevelt enough. It's sophisticated, intimate, child-friendly, romantic, glamorous, safe and a must-stay.

Allie F,1,"West Hollywood, California",2015-08-31,BUSINESS,2015-09-04,5,Impeccable Stay!,"I stayed at the Hollywood Roosevelt for one week on business. From the start, it was absolutely wonderful.

I checked into my King Suite room and a beautiful fruit platter was waiting for me along with a big glass bottle of Evian. The room was very clean and had a great view of both Hollywood Blvd. and the Jimmy Kimmel Show backlot area (and DTLA beyond).

I had elected to stay in this room since I was going to be leaving for a few early morning business meetings and did not want the noise from the pool--but was curious to see what a Cabana Balcony room was like. I inquired at the desk and was complimentary upgraded, no extra charge since I had booked through my corporate travel agency.

The room was perfect (Room 204). To be honest the music and noise was not really a problem, moreso was the drunk people milling about in our hallway into the wee hours on Friday night. This was not a problem any of the other nights and on Tuesday (Nightswim party), I had the best sleep of my entire stay!

Amenities are divine (Davines), food from 25 Degrees is great, room serve breakfast was wonderful (Which we enjoyed on our balcony overlooking the pool).

This is a very hip hotel with beautiful people and old hollywood nostalgia.

We ventured out to a few nightspots outside the hotel in Hollywood and taking Uber was the best bet ($5-$8 one way).

Library Bar mixologists are outstanding and a real treat.

Only complaint was extremely rude girls at the Spare Room. I complained to the Front desk and was comped with drink tickets for me and each of my friends.

We were unpleasantly surprised after a long trip with our two adult kids (19 and 20) to be welcomed in such messy surroundings. However, the room did not disappoint. Very well decorated, good beds, ample room, albeit a small bathroom with hardly any space for your belongings. As compensation for the ""start"" of our stay we were given complimentary breakfast, which was a nice gesture.  Hotel itself is impressive in architectural details and has a grand feel to it. Outside is the madness of all the tourist attractions, but our room was very quiet and comfortable.

The hotel is in a great location, right on Hollywood Boulevard and right across from Madame Tussaud's.
There is a 24 hour restaurant down stairs on the Lobby Level called 25 degrees, food is great and they do a pretty good granola and yogurt breakfast but can be expensive if you are on a budget. Breakfast for two with coffee, eggs bacon, toast and granola was about $50 USD. 
The room was nice but was a little small. The shower pressure was bad for a short person, felt like sprinkle rain and the bath plug didn't work properly so the water drained nearly as fast as it filled. Room was always clean and the bed was nice and comfortable.
One thing to be aware of is this hotel can attract celebrities and also general people with money so if there is an event happening in the Pent House like we experienced don't expect to get in the elevator quickly. We waited nearly 30 mins for an elevator from the 6th floor to the lobby. It kept going from G to PH and back to G without stopping on any other level. There are only two elevators and they are old so also aren't the quickest. 
We spoke to the front desk and advised there was an event and they would be happy to take us up the service elevator which was nice but would have been nice to have know about the event earlier. You can stake the stairs to the lower levels but are not able to take them up as the door locks when exiting your floor level 
The pool is nice and there are a lot of pool parties in the warmer months, the noise did not affect our room at all.

MrHandBaggageOnly,468,"Stroud, United Kingdom",2015-08-31,COUPLES,2015-08-31,4,We had one of the best views in Hollywood!,"Our second night in LA saw us with tickets to a concert at the Hollywood Bowl (amazing venue and sound!) so we decided to book a hotel within walking distance. The Hollywood Roosevelt seemed to fit our criteria and indeed it was only about a twenty minute walk from our room to our seats at the Bowl. Yes, walking in LA is possible!

At check in the young lady dealing with us offered us an upgrade (free-of-charge) for no apparent reason. We had booked a Superior Queen, but I have no idea if it was in fact an upgrade as we have not stayed here before so could not compare it to other rooms of the type we booked. Regardless, the room we were given was on the 7th Floor in the Tower Block and overlooked Hollywood Boulevard, with views of the Chinese Theatre, the Hollywood Walk of Fame and the Hollywood sign itself. It was, without a doubt, one of the best views I’ve ever had from a hotel room!

The room itself was a decent size, with a comfortable bed and a desk. The television was in the corner of the room due to the fact we had windows on two sides of the room, which if you wanted to watch television (we didn’t) could be a little awkward. The bathroom was quite small with a shower only, no bathtub, the only problem being the awkwardly placed bathroom tissue holder (loo roll holder in my world!) which was low and too far back. Sadly, no free bottled water.

When we checked out it happened that we had the same young lady who had checked us in the night before and I was very impressed when she clearly remembered us and asked us how our concert had been. It was my impression that all the staff here were very pleasant and highly trained, which is always great to see.

The Roosevelt has a calmness to it that is wrecked once you walk outside on to the craziness that is Hollywood Boulevard, but the fact you can be so close to the madness but yet so far once you are inside is a big selling point. 

We really enjoyed our night here and were we to stay in Hollywood again would certainly look at the Hollywood Roosevelt as our first option.",,,5.0,4.0,,4.0,,Reservations T,The Hollywood Roosevelt Reservations Team,2015-09-09,"Dear MrHandBaggageOnly,

While the location is good there is little more going for it unless you are in your twenties and enjoy noisy pool parties. I was somewhat surprised to find ear plugs on the bedside tables. The rooms have recently been redecorated but the air con didnt work properly making our room was very hot. As for the lifts, (there are only two for 400 guests) are diabolical, having a mind of their own, in need of a good vacuum and causing large queues. The whole lobby area is dark and dingy and out dated. Most of the time there was one barman so drinks took a very long time to be delivered.
The pool area was authentic 50s and this is where our our daily breakfast was served. While pancakes and omelettes are made while you wait there is not a cereal in sight and wait for it all served on plastic plates and cutlery!!!! Not very ""green"" for 400 guests who may be breakfasting daily.Oh and unless you want to pay a huge price for the Evian water on the bedside table dont drink it.

I've heard some great things about The Hollywood Roosevelt and its history so I decided to stay there.  I thought it was really cool that Clark Gable and Marilyn Monroe stayed there.  I checked in on Thursday and stayed through Monday.  I love the fact that it's in the middle of everything and right on Hollywood Blvd.  I had a Cabana Balcony room which was definitely right in the middle of things.  The parties around the pool were great and I had a great view of the action.  The pool parties on Saturday and Sunday reminded me of parties in Miami and Las Vegas.  The Library Bar is a hidden gem and I would definitely recommend checking it out if you have the chance.  During my stay, I received some of the best service that I've ever encountered throughout my world travels.  I've stayed in Ritz Carlton's, Four Seasons, and other 5 star hotels and this was definitely on par.  Everyone from the valets, bellmen, wait staff, and management were very accommodating and had a genuine interest in the quality of my stay.  I ate at every restaurant throughout the hotel.  The food was phenomenal and I had one of the best burgers at 25 degrees.  I ate there every day during my stay.

Viciousb,47,"London, United Kingdom",2015-07-31,BUSINESS,2015-08-23,3,"Great location and restaurants, shame about the attention to detail in the rooms","On arrival, I was told there was a pool party going on and if I would like to attend they would give me two wristbands - this was great! When I arrived at the room, it was stylish although quite small - it overlooked the next-door hotel and the Chinese theatre.  
So the negatives: the bathroom was very basic and I was disappointed by the level of amenities (I generally travel light so with limited bathroom products) here they only had shampoo and a lotion, so had to go out and purchase shower gel etc. it was frustrating, particularly as I then had to leave them behind. 
No kettle/ coffee machine provided, and they weren't quick to replace the ultra expensive water ($10 for Evian), so had to order from room service.
The wardrobe was missing the dressing gown and there was a single flipflop in there too (am assuming they don't check this often). It took 2 request attempts before this was rectified.  
The walls are paper thin and the AC is very loud.  The first night i was woken up twice by people fighting in the corridor.  You can also hear the next door room's tv.
Checking out was a bit of a pain, since there were limited staff available, i'd got a late check out, but then hit the checking in traffic, so there was a wait...(so if you need to be somewhere, give yourself time to check-out or avoid check-in time). 

It's not all bad though, so here are the positives:
Location is fab for Hollywood tourist attractions
Tropicana - Lovely pool and the party was great - lots of opportunity for people watching, it really is a crowd that wants to be seen! The rooms are provided with flip-flops, but not sure if you have to pay for these...
The restaurants are great, particularly liked 25 degrees - their hash browns are to die for and the staff lovely!  Public Kitchen's steak was wonderful - just don't forget to order your sides, it comes with nothing :) Unfortunately I didn't get to The Library, but I have heard very good things from friends.
The main lobby is a wonderful step back in time piece of architecture - every time I sat there, I saw something new...if you're inquisitive there will be lots to discover. 

I'm not sure if I would stay again, it was pretty pricey for the quality and attention to detail, but I would definitely go back to the restaurants and the pool.",Request a room with a pool view.,3.0,4.0,3.0,,,,kmcb225,Manager,2015-10-09,"Thank you for your feedback.

Convicttraveller,44,,2015-07-31,FRIENDS,2015-08-23,4,Great location in Hollywood,"Had 3 nights at the Roosevelt and had a great time. The hotel is very historic and is right in the middle of the Hollywood Blv strip across the road from the Chinese Theatre and all of the Hollywood stars along the footpath. So if the Hollywood thing is what you want this hotel is ideal. The pool is very good and a relaxing spot after a day touring around.
The rooms we stayed in overlooking the pool have been renovated and very modern but were dark with poor lighting but still very comfortable and clean.
Highlight is the ""25 degrees"" bar and restaurant which is open 24hrs with friendly staff and good food.  
The hotel hosted the first Academy Awards in 1929 so has some history with a grand ballroom and foyer.

pauldean78,166,"Brighton, United Kingdom",2015-08-31,COUPLES,2015-08-22,3,"Splendid location, stylish bar/lounge area - but some issues","Spent four days here in early August having booked through booking.com (unlike other hotels on our trip that were booked through a flight/hotel/car package with an agent - with no surprise charges). 

Having used online hotel booking sites happily in Europe, the lack of pricing transparency (making genuine price comparisons from different sources extremely difficult) when booking through this method in the US came as a shock . The add-ons in the final bill at this hotel (some of which were a surprise) included: City Tax, Occupancy Tax, California Tourism Fee and Los Angeles Tourism Fee.  Lesson has now been learnt.

The hotel location was excellent - we needed to visit family and tourist destinations in all directions from here over four days. Driving to here from LAX was easy (with Satnav) and the valet parking at the hotel was efficient and friendly. (Cheaper public parking options are available just across the road we noticed).

The hotel lounge/bar area is very impressive and a delightful space for socialising and chatting. The adjoining bar/diner serves good food and particularly good breakfasts, with some healthy options too. Great decor and photos in the public areas that really captured the history of this place.

Our ""King Room"" was an average/small hotel room I'd say - understandable given the hotel's star location, with tiny bathroom (hardly any storage space), and recently renovated. Overall nicely decorated except that the bathroom flooring and wall tiling was already showing signs of staining - a bad choice of materials there perhaps 

The room itself seemed strangely cluttered with unhelpful furniture that got in the way of basic tasks, such as closing the curtains. Most furniture surfaces were covered with (expensive) snacks and drinks - nothing complimentary here. Bizarrely, there were no drawers or shelves in the room for clothes (even though the wardrobe was big enough) which meant living out of a suitcase for four days. The four-poster bed, in such a small room, was an absurd feature as it made the room seem unnecessarily claustrophobic rather than luxurious as was presumably intended. The bed itself though was supremely comfortable.

The aircon was loud - but complimentary earplugs were provided. The friendly, attentive and helpful reception staff did try their best to address this when we told them and agreed to move us to a different room. But the aircon was equally loud there too. So that must just be me being sensitive. Turned it off and boiled on the last night.

WiFi was free and efficient in the lobby, but a staggering $14.99 for 5MB of data for 24h in the room. We didn't touch that. The lifts were rather hit and miss - sometimes long waits and buttons that didn't work sometimes.

On balance, I think this hotel would be perfect if you were coming to one of the pool parties and simply need somewhere to crash for a day afterwards. But for a four-day stay with luggage, I wish we had gone elsewhere or shortened the visit. We paid the price for failing to plan this part of our US trip effectively.",,,4.0,1.0,,2.0,,kmcb225,Manager,2015-10-09,"Thank you for taking the time to review the hotel.

Clarehcarver,14,"Reading, United Kingdom",2015-08-31,COUPLES,2015-08-22,3,Cool hotel but be prepared to pay for EVERYTHING!,"I have no idea how much we paid to stay here as it was part of a 10 night trip booked through a tour organiser with no individual breakdown given - however safe to say it was one of the most expensive hotels we stayed in based on location. However, it wasn't the best. The room was nice enough, but quite small. We overlooked the pool which was cool but one night they had a pool party so it was fairly noisy. The worst thing though was the air con!! It was so loud that after the first night we just chilled our room as low as it would go in the evening then turned it off so we could sleep!! 

Also, you have to be prepared to pay for EVERYTHING. Parking is $36 per day, which I guess is due to location. The minibar is extortionate ($5 for a small bottle if water!) so we left well alone. We spent $100+ by the pool one day on 2 drinks, 2 enterees and 2 ice creams! The prices on the menu aren't horrendous but what they forget to tell you is that compulsory service charge at 15% is added (annoying as I already tipped the waitress!) and a 5% admin fee is also added, what for I'm not sure. Plus tax of course. Worst of all internet is not free - $15 per day. We stayed in 6 hotels in California and this was the only one without free wifi. I would have thought in such an expensive hotel it would be included - struck me as a bit money grabbing to be honest. 

The pool is lovely (we were there midweek and never waited more than 5mins for a lounger), apparently it's a good spot for celebrity spotting though I have to say we didn't see any, and the location is ideal for exploring Hollywood. Not sure I'd return though!",,,4.0,,5.0,,4.0,kmcb225,Manager,2015-10-09,"Hi Clarehcarver,

Sherri Y,1,"Orange Park, Florida",2015-06-30,FAMILY,2015-08-19,5,Best jolted in Hollywood,"After seeing negative reviews about the noise level in the cabana rooms I was a little nervous about staying in one.  There were three parties while we were there and the noise was not bad at all!  I do suggest that if you gave small children that you request a tower room.   

If you want amazing customer service this is the place.  Our room was not ready when we arrived.  We were given drink vouchers for the wait.  We went to the Library Bar and it was amazing.  We even needed to get something out of our car, a TV show was being filmed in the garage at that time but the great guys at valet made it happen. We were told it might be awhile which was fine with us but it only too 15 minutes.  The customer service is top notch and in my option the best in the area. 

This hotel was right in the middle of everything we wanted to see while in Hollywood.  We loved our room and plan to stay at the Hollywood Roosevelt whenever we are in the Hollywood area.   Defiantly will recommend to friends and family.",Cabanas are great but if you have small children stay in the tower.,5.0,5.0,,,,5.0,Reservations T,The Hollywood Roosevelt Reservations Team,2015-08-22,"Dear Sherri Y,

The hotel is right in the middle of the action on Hollywood Boulevard. I read on previous reviews that the standard rooms in the hotel are small so booked a King Studio room which is good in size but the bathroom was tiny. Check in went smooth and the hotel was very accommodating with my requests. The pool area is small but nice and really gets hopping on the weekend so unless you are into pool party scene on weekends ask to be put in a room in the main hotel tower facing away from the pool area. The fitness area is again small but has all the machines and equipment you need for a good work out. The downsides of the hotel is that even though it has been renovated it does feel old. There is no self parking available so expect to spend $36 per night for valet and for a hotel this price they should offer free wifi.,Ask for a room in the main tower on a high floor facing away from the pool area.,4.0,4.0,,5.0,,,Reservations T,The Hollywood Roosevelt Reservations Team,2015-08-18,"Dear gotapresent,

Apologies for your impression of the hotel.

McMidgy,119,"Deerfield, Illinois",2015-06-30,COUPLES,2015-08-12,4,Incredible customer service,"For starters, the building itself is beautiful.  Truly a piece of old Hollywood culture and architecture. I love the neon sign at night.  I love the placing of photographs of classic Hollywood celebrities throughout the hallways, and the Golden era, Spanish style front lobby (though it was a bit emptier than what I'd anticipated).

The pool area had a 30-40 minute wait.  Yes, this is how things work in this area.  There are only so many cabanas and beds, and there are probably a lot more bodies that would like to use those cabanas and beds than the pool area is able to accommodate.  Thus, you are going to have to wait.  You can order a $15 drink and stand around idly while you wait, but wait you must.

However, as my husband and I waited, we jokingly uploaded a picture to Instagram stating how we were very unsuccessfully getting a spot by the pool and the PR director *immediately* responded to our post and *literally* came out to find us.  It was both hilarious and incredible.  We could not believe it, and we felt mildly ashamed for doing what we had done!  She immediately hooked us up with a bed by the pool and asked if there was anything else we needed.  She later had dessert delivered up to our room.

I will say that the PR here is top notch, and the customer service is excellent.

The room itself, however, was by far the smallest room I've ever stayed in at any hotel.  By far, without a shadow of a doubt.  The decor and design were lovely, and the amenities were nice as well (travel-sized Davines?!  You're kidding!), but the space itself was miniscule.  One of the rooms where you need to move out of the way for the other person to get by- *that* small (though the bed itself was dreamy).  And our room looked out on to the backstreet behind the hotel and overlooked the football field of Hollywood High School.  Nice.  Had we been overlooking the other side of the hotel, we might have been met with a view of some premiere at the Chinese Theater, but those rooms likely cost more $$.  That being said, our football field view cost us the most money we'd paid for any hotel experience we'd ever had.  In all good conscience, I cannot say that the HR was worth the money paid.

Teddy's was, for some reason, closed the night we stayed.  The Library Bar was open and it is truly a gorgeous space.  Dark and moody, looking more like a laboratory than a bar.  My husband's cocktail was quite strange, almost a cocktail version of caprese salad complete with fresh basil and tomato.  He didn't like it; I did.  I loved what I was given, as well.  I say have an adventurous heart and you won't be disappointed.

All in all, I'm glad we had the experience, but it was simply too much money.  I would not pay for it again.  But the service was beautiful!",,,,,,,,Reservations T,The Hollywood Roosevelt Reservations Team,2015-08-17,"Dear midgybride,

PBS99,13,,2015-02-28,FRIENDS,2015-08-10,5,Historic Hollywood with an Update,"My sister and I stayed at The Hollywood Roosevelt in February 2015 because we were attending the Oscar Red Carpet. We chose The Hollywood Roosevelt for its proximity to the Dolby Theater and because of its reputation. It did not disappoint!

When we arrived we were told our room was not yet ready so we decided to grab a drink and lunch in 25 Degrees. It was lunch hour in Hollywood and the hotel was full of people coming in for the Oscars. Our lunch as good & expensive but it's LA so we expected that. We also met some interesting people who were sitting at the table directly next to ours.

Our room was ready right after lunch so we checked in and headed upstairs. We had booked a Studio Double and it was definitely large enough for two sisters, their clothing and shoes! The bathroom was huge and the amenities were fabulous. We had a great view of Hollywood Boulevard too!

We did check out the pool area and cabanas but E! News was set up there for there Oscar shows so most of it was off limits to hotel guests. The hotel lobby bar was always busy and had a great clubby feel. Public Kitchen is right off the library but we did not have a chance to eat here as we were only in LA three nights and wanted to try some other places too!

The Hollywood Roosevelt is a fabulous old, vintage hotel that has been recently renovated. It's full of old Hollywood history but comes with a hefty price tag. I felt we got what we paid for and I was pleased with our experience. Everyone is always looking at everyone else to see if they're ""someone"" but we did not make any star sightings while were in the hotel except for the E! News reporters.

Luma A,397,Bahrain,2015-07-31,FAMILY,2015-08-09,5,Hollywood Ventage Sophistication ,"It felt great to live in The Hollywood Roosevelt .. I think it is the right way to feel the Hollywoodic old days elegance and glamor.

I'll skip talking about the history of the hotel cause that is available every where on the net and I go to the main part. 

The hotel has two entrances ... one is through the walk of fame right in front of Madame Tussauds and the Chinese Theater  and all the crowd and noise of Hollywood Boulevard, and the other entrance is on the back through the hotel valet parking area it takes you right to the front desk. The hotel agreed that we keep our luggage with them while we were in a 4 days cruise  (for a daily charge) and once we came back those were returned to us. I explained to the sweet lady at the front desk that I want her to give me the best, largest and most recently renovated room in my booking category, but she gave me a way better offer! 😀 She offered me a complimentary upgrade for a junior suite with one king size bed and added 2 roll over single beds 😀😀😀. The room was very spacious that we could fit the two additional beds without causing any inconveniences. The room has also a very spacious walk through closet, however the bathroom was small reletively  but yet comfortable to be used and the shower size was big enough.

The corridors of the hotel were hot for some reason! But rooms are conditioned.

I loved the hotel vintage style furniture and colors. 

The hotel is very clean and very well maintained. 

The hotel management doesn't mind if I remove any thing from the minibar by my self and use the fridge to store my own food, but will ask for additional charges if I need the room service guys to remove the minibar items.

The room doesn't have a coffee machine, however I have been told that there is free coffee at the lobby but I didn't try it ... anyway Starbucks is just across the street and many other shops, coffee shops, grocery markets, movie theaters and restaurants all over Hollywood Boulevard or walk of fame.

The hotel has no resort fees or any other hidden fees, however valet parking cost $40 per day which is reasonable for the middle of Hollywood area.

I was a bit pissed off when I was about to leave the hotel because after lots of efforts to squeeze our luggage in to our van few hours ealier we received our van and it was empty!!! The hotel removed our luggage a d reserve them for us .. I do understand that this might be for security reasons but I preferd if the hotel discussed this with us in advance.

Another issue occurred with one of our friends who were staying also in the Hollywood Roosevelt at the same time ... after check out and 5 days after leaving the hotel  he discovered some money amount deduct by the hotel from his credit card account as minibar charges! That was wired ..  But he is going to follow up with the hotel and I'm sure that the hotel management are professional enough to resolve the issue.

I definitely would love to stay at The Hollywood Roosevelt again if I had the opportunity and repeat the sweet memories I had.

Claire B,4,"Upper Saddle River, New Jersey",2015-07-31,FAMILY,2015-08-09,5,My Second Home for the Summer,"I stayed in the Hollywood Roosevelt for four weeks this summer. Everyday I woke up in a comfortable bed and either ordered room service or went down to 25 Degrees Burger Bar for breakfast. Two weeks into my stay the hotel opened a cafe called the Tropicana Cafe out by the pool that serves the most outstanding brunch menu from 11am to about 10:30pm. The cafe was my absolute favorite place to eat in all of Hollywood let alone at the hotel. It's the kind of restaurant that you have to go to hungry because you want to order everything off the menu. All the food comes out in a timely manner, especially when Katie is your server because she moves twice as fast as another server at the cafe. 

All the staff members were amazing. Shout out to Mark the Bell captain and Blake another bellman for always being ready to help my family and I out right when we pulled up at valet or walked up the stairs from the ground floor toward the valet. All the front office and front desk staff were amazing. Especially Sebastian, Ingrid, Natalie, and Sam, Justine. when I came to the front desk for anything those staff members were always there to help and seemed eager to as well. 

Bre Smith-Perez, the Director of Guest Relations was a helping hand from day one till the day I checked out. She gave me interesting places to explore like Runyon Canyon Park. She would constantly checked in with me to see how my stay was going and to make sure I had everything I needed.

Paddy M,30,,2015-08-31,COUPLES,2015-08-04,2,"There are better, cheaper, less sneaky hotel options","First the good. The location is unbeatable if you're after the hollywood views. The rooms are clean, modern and the staff are polite enough although they are expecting a well dressed hollywood youth with daddys credit card and porsche rather than a well off Brit who got stumped with the 'or similar' option from his rental company. I want the staff to knowI wouldn't knowingly pay money for a chevvy. 

The check in to the hotel was slow. They had a pool party on at the time which is fine but I want to get in, give you my card and get in my room not fight off drunk Beverly Hill playboys in trunks. 

Anyway, the rooms. They are small which I csn deal with but there seems to be an effort to make them appear smaller by adding unnecissary furniture. We had three side tables, a beureau and an arm chair and a long desk under the tv thatwouldn't work with the armchair if you intended to use the desk at all. 

The bed was ok size, about a standard UK double which is fairly small to be honest but given the size of the room,understandable. However it is inexplicably four poster in a failed attempt to appear posh. Theres not curtains on it, it is pointless, redundant and makes the room feel smaller, drawing your attention away from the high cielings. 

It may sound nit picky but it annoyed me immensly. The Roosevelt needs to be more European. I.e. Smarter with use of limited space. 

The bathroom however is good, although the shower is a bit weak and innaccurate. 

So far the Roosevelt would be hovering at a 3. I have dropped it to a 2 because they are sneaky little gits. 
Don't fall for the sweets and snacks they place in the open with a nearly missable price list. We didnt but it would be easy enough to make the mistake. They also put some water by the bed but after seeing the price list we kept our distance. 

This is the first hotel in the Western Hemisphere that does not provide free wifi in the rooms. For me this is a necissity for a city hotel in the West. I dont want to go to the lobby at 4am to check in online for my flight. The price options start at about $14 if I remember right for like 1mb/s 
I stayed in a remote hotel in the mesa verde national park that had free wifi. 
Another minor annoyance was their tv schedule was set to east coast not west coast. More a display of incompetence than anything. 

Lastly there is no option to self park. If there is I was not made aware or implied I couldn't. I got quite used to valet in Vegas, it was easy and most importantly cost me about $2 in a tip. 
It was only until I checked out I realised the roosevelt had charged me $20 a go to park my car. 
The second occasion I left the car outside 5 minutes with a bloke who didn't speak English all that well. This was just while I ran upstairs to drop a bag in my room before returning the car to the rental company. I was staying another night at the hotel. $20 for 5 minutes! I'd have parked it on the street if I knew. 
I wasnt in any mood to argue that point and just wanted to get out if LA. 

The only reason this Hotel is not a 1 is because of location and a clean room. 

The Hotel has a pool but its nothing to shout about. Going by their approach to everything they probably charge you extra for it. 

In summary this hotel is after your money and doesn't really care too much about you. I had a more personal experience in a 3500 room hotel in Vegas and found it easier to hang on to my money. 

Find somewhere downtown and fight your way north. It'd actually end up cheaper and easier. ",,,,,,,,kmcb225,Manager,2015-10-08,"Hello Paddy M,

Our king room was very sterile looking, almost as if the furniture was from Ikea. I think in renovating the rooms, they have removed all of the historic charm. The bed was about 6 inches from the floor and not comfortable. Also the walls were very thin and we could hear everything in the room next door and on the street below. The valets and bellmen were all very nice and welcoming. The historic lobby is still beautiful and the location is great if you want to sightsee in Hollywood.

Upon arrival at the hotel, we were offered a 'complimentary upgrade'. Not doing our research, we accepted.  Upon returning to Canada, our upgrade was not really an upgrade as our original room was more expensive that the one we were upgraded to. Not a big deal for us as we were only there for 1 night, but just a heads up if you are offered an 'upgrade'. 

The hotel is clean, and offers everything you need for a stay in Hollywood. We didn't spend too much time at the hotel as we wanted to visit the surrounding area.

The bed was comfortable and the rooms were clean.  We didn't have hot water for about 3 hours when we arrived due to a boiler problem which really sucked since we just got off a plane.

Jennifer P,7,,2015-07-31,FAMILY,2015-07-29,5,My 2nd stay at the Hollywood Roosevelt,"I booked my stay months in advance.  The rooms are newly renovated although I did not see these rooms prior.  We got a queen superior room on the third floor.  I had two issues with this room: 1) This is a fairly small queen sized bed.  It's more like a standard.  2) This is room is a bit small with the new furniture.   There is a table under the TV and next to the bed.  We had to turn sideways to walk towards the window.  Perhaps they could find another table that's not quite that wide.  I did inquire with the front desk that I thought I might be in the wrong room.  They were full that night, but offered to put me in another room the next day.  It was quite an upgrade which I was not expecting. :)  King superior is a great, spacious room.  

The hotel staff is always friendly and really look out for their guests.  You should show your appreciation by tipping. :)

The location is fantastic.  Families can easily walk across the street to Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum, tour the Dolby Theater, grab a bite to eat at In N Out Burger off Sunset or walk to Musso and Frank's for something more formal, walk around the corner to the Hollywood Museum, a short drive to the Hollywood Bowl for some music, etc.

Just some info:  It's perfectly fine for families to stay here, but keep in mind this hotel is known for their pool parties (and other events) so some nights it may get loud.   If you want to avoid the noise do not get a cabana room (my first trip). You can park your car there around the cost of $40/day - they take good care of it and quick to get your vehicle.  Room service is pricey, but you're paying for the convenience.  Queen superiors have bath tubs, king superiors and cabanas have showers (I've staying in 3 rooms).

There are other hotels in the area which can be more expensive, but you have a real gem in the Hollywood Roosevelt.  I'll be happy to go back a 3rd time.",Get a king sized room and up.

We ate burgers and washed them down with mojitos. Yum! The music was great and everyone there had a good vibe. There were kids in the pool but it was fun watching them flounder around in the water. The music was good...a mixture of hip-hop, R&B, Pop, and EDM. The room was a good size. Just big enough for two.

This year our family's summer holiday was a ""stay-cation"" with a classic Hollywood theme (Hollywood Blvd, Musso & Franks, The Pantages, Universal Studios).  Naturally, homebase for such an experience is the Hollywood Roosevelt.  

The Roosevelt has been a revered hang-out for everyone from Charlie Chaplin to Sinatra to Marilyn Monroe. In addition to this rich history, the hotel offers newly renovated rooms with modern amenities, and top notch service.

From the moment we arrived, the quality of service was terrific. The valet and bell staff (special kudos to bellmen Reilly and Dave) made the initial arrival effortless, and the check-in was efficient and cordial. 

Spending time poolside at the Roosevelt is a sublime Hollywood experience. From the cool elegance of the David Hockney pool, to attentive poolside servers, this relaxing oasis is a ""must-do"" for anyone in Southern California. Lounging under the swaying palms sipping a cool mojito poolside is simply the best!

Whether you live in So Cal or are visiting, do yourself a favor and stay at the Hotel Roosevelt. It's an experience that can't be found anywhere else!",,,,,,,,Reservations T,The Hollywood Roosevelt Reservations Team,2015-08-01,"Dear CaliforniaSam04,

K M,20,"Jakarta, Indonesia",2015-07-31,COUPLES,2015-07-27,5,Best place to stay in Hollywood,"3rd stay at the Hollywood Roosevelt, and we found it even better than the last one. Hotel with history and heritage.  Rooms - newly renovated, stylish, comfortable.  Staff was much better on this visit.  Natalie at the front desk, Sean and Blake the bellmen, the valets, etc.  - all very helpful.   Location right across the Chinese theatre.  The experience an eclectic mix of old, new, classy and kitsch.  Kitsch is for the pool party -  an interesting scene, but will definitely dissuade you from using the beautiful David Hockney pool the day after.  

Like Hollywood, it has a few oddities.
-The bathrooms are tiny. The one in the King Studio is even tinier than the one in the Superior Queen. 
-It doesn't have the usual beautiful hotel breakfast set-up.
-The manager at the lobby bar seems a bit dubious of patrons.  Our fault as we took an unfinished bottle of wine to the lobby after we checked out and were waiting for our airport car to arrive.  When we found out there was a corkage fee, we were fine with that.  He gave us the impression that he though we would be difficult and kept on reiterating that it was the law.  We told him no worries, but he seemed stressed.",,4.0,4.0,,4.0,,,Natalie G,Manager,2015-08-18,"Dear K M,

The hotel was built in 1927 and retains many aspects of it's original charm. The main lobby is all original with wood beamed ceilings, period furniture and a dark charm that takes one back to that era. 
All the rooms have now been refurbished in a modern theme with mostly neutral grayish colors as the photos show. It is all nicely done but a warm accent here and there might be nice. See the pics for the most elegant selection of refreshments we had ever seen.
Nostalgia seeps from various areas -- the Marilyn Monroe poolside bungalow, the large room that ushered in the very first Academy Awards in 1929, Gable and Lombard...slept here...
The great highlight of our stay was the superior service provided by the staff, in general, and one gentleman in particular. Mr. Mark Bell noticed the Trip Advisor tag on my companion's baggage and, there began the special treatment. He asked us if we would like an upgraded room and proceeded to show us two others. The desk clerk had nicely also offered us a complimentary upgrade to a pool cabana. We toured a couple of lovely rooms and decided we liked the one we had checked into for it's 5th floor view of the LA skyline. In the process, Mr. Bell took us up to the 12th floor Penthouse Suite (see pics) and outside to the roof with a great view that has been exclusively enjoyed by previous guests i.e. Prince, Brad Pitt...etc...The next morning, Mark took us on a wonderful tour, pointing out the Blossom Room, i.e. Academy Awards 1929, the bowling alley and other areas.

Gary G,31,"Spalding, United Kingdom",2015-06-30,COUPLES,2015-07-22,3,Shallow pursuit of perfection,"Having read some of the recent reviews of this hotel, I can only guess that people are in awe of the facade of this hotel. Peel back a few layers and it's not as pretty as it seems. 

So to start, the hotel is beautiful. From the swimming pool/bar area that is straight out of a movie scene to the chic restaurants/bars isn't he mezzanine level. The hotel is a feast for the eyes. You can't help but start to relax and feel like a million dollars. Our room was plush. It was spacious, the size of the TV was only dwarfed by the bed. The bathroom was also modern and may well have been a celebrity dressing room. Pretty indeed.

Unfortunately, the beauty was as shallow as that. We arrived in the late afternoon on a Sunday. Our room was not available so we had a short wait at the desk. After a lot of conversations/whispering, they decided to give us a room on the third floor instead of the 7th. The receptionist told us we were being upgraded to a bigger room. Once we accepted and took the keys, they told us the view was inferior. Indeed, the only view we had was the back of the hotel sign. I would suggest it was less of an upgrade and more of a swap of sorts.

We also had problems with the pool. On our first night we were unable to use it. The Terminator premiere was showing and the hotel hosted an after party there. It wouldn't be available until late morning the following day. When we did got there the next afternoon, we were told to take our towels back to the room or hide them so we didn't ruin the aesthetic of the pool area. My wife and I felt really uncomfortable and unwelcome. We felt like might get ejected at any moment for being too ugly or committing a social faux pas.

Finally, the hotel didn't provide free wifi.

So on balance, the hotel gets three stars because it is well appointed and we enjoyed the time we were there. We just felt it was a shame that the hotel and the staff end up alienating their guests by restricting access to some parts of the hotel for the rich/famous and being so focused on looks. Beauty is only skin deep and perhaps this hotel should take heed.",,,,,,,,Bre S,Director of Guest Relations,2015-08-19,"Gary G , Spalding, United Kingdom (7/22/15)

We are a historic landmark and there is much to be in “awe” about. While we pride ourselves on our history we never try to let that be the end all be all. We are glad to hear that you loved the cabana area, the historic lobby and your plush room. We just completed our renovation and while we want to preserve the hotels history we also wanted to make sure that we added some elements that made sense for 2015.  
Our front desk team always tries to get guests into their rooms as quickly as possible. It appears that they upgraded your room type to a larger room so that you would not have to wait. The funny thing about the third floor is that there is more history on that floor as the rooftop which has now become the home to different machinery to keep the hotel cold for everyone use to be a VIP restaurant. The floor was the “it” floor to stay on. The hotel sign you looked at is the original hotel sign. Did you by chance call down to the front desk? We always try to make sure everyone is happy. If you weren’t pleased with the view I know they would have offered to move you back. I am sorry we weren’t not able to move you prior to your departure. 
We are home to many events and premiers. Somethings that brings the Hollywood life of “lights, camera, action!” The pool does close at 7pm daily however, the bar does stay open till 2am. During premiers or other events we always have 4 other bars for our guests to enjoy. Not sure what happened the next day as we never tell guests to take their towels back to their room.  I apologize that you felt that way as our pool is always open to our guests. Especially on a Monday. 

We do provide free Wi-Fi in all our public spaces as well as to our iPrefer members. In no way do we alienate our guests, we welcome all guests from all around the world. Would love to have you come visit us again so you can experience the service we pride ourselves on. Please contact me directly so we can further discuss.

After a bad hotel experience in San Francisco, I was apprehensive about our visit to LA, on arrival I was wonderfully surprised. The decor in the reception & lobby is amazing, classic old Hollywood. We stayed for 3 nights and the fantastic receptionist upgraded us for the last 2 nights which was brilliant. Our first room was a standard double room, slightly small for us with 2 huge suitcases but perfectly nice and clean with fresh and quality decor and furniture, we would have been perfectly content with this room for the whole stay. On 'check out' the next day to our next room, the concierge took our luggage out of our room and moved it for us to the new room whilst we were out for the day. On arrival in to our new room on a high floor in a king room, I was a little giddy, it was double the size of the previous night's room, with an extra bathroom and soooo much room. The same standard of cleanliness and decor, just with more (and a bigger bed). It was a lovely lovely room. We drank in the bars in the hotel, the one sticking out of the lobby is nice, the staff are friendly. There was an event by the pool on the first night we arrived, we had a wander round and had we been dressed for the occasion we definitely would have got involved, it looked really fun. For the final night we went into the cocktail bar in the lobby, it was brilliant, the bar man certainly new his stuff and when I asked for gin with anything, he made me a beautiful and fruity strawberry and kiwi cocktail (it was so good, my husband also ordered one). Every one of the receptionists we spoke to on our visit were fantastic and a huge thank you to them. We had an amazing 3 nights there. Definitely a recommendation for anyone visiting Hollywood, it's full of Hollywood history and it's awesome.","If you want a poolside Cabana room, check to see if there&#39;s an event on before booking, parties go on late if you aren&#39;t joining in",5.0,5.0,5.0,,,,Reservations T,The Hollywood Roosevelt Reservations Team,2015-07-24,"Dear dharvs,

Diane G,80,"Big Bear Lake, California",2015-07-31,NONE,2015-07-16,4,Pleasure,"Deluxe room was fantastic. Wonderful king bed was so comfortable we slept soundly all night.  Window shades are awesome, kept the room dark til we finally got up at 9:30!

The Roosevelt is a charming old hotel that has been beautifully upgraded, right in the heart of Hollywood.

The only reason I can't give it 5 stars is the constant waiting for service, whether at the front desk (where I have been waiting 10 minutes so far just to check out) , at the pool (where we sat for 30 minutes before getting up and tracking down a server to get a drink) or the Public restaurant (where we sat for 30 minutes, right when they opened, first people seated, just to get an order of oysters.  It's not like there was any cooking involved and ours was the first order of the evening. )

I am now waiting for the valet to get the car, hopefully not long.  For such a nice (and expensive) hotel, service needs to step up their game.",,,,,,,,Reservations T,The Hollywood Roosevelt Reservations Team,2015-07-21,"Dear Nani4eight,

CharChelmo,32,"Chelmsford, United Kingdom",2015-06-30,COUPLES,2015-07-16,3,"Noisy and rowdy, no free wifi","We stayed at the Hollywood Roosevelt for 2 nights in June 2015.

Overall, it did not meet my expectations I had prior to visiting. When we first arrived, the concierge basically ignored us so we had no help with our bags. We checked in to a Cabana room, which was close to the pool area. There was an event going on by the pool that day, so as we walked to it with all our suitcases we were stopped by security to check our name -no problem with that. But where we were stopped was right by the entrance to the pool and the guests/visitors at the pool were incredibly rude just barging past us even though we were obviously trying to get past to go up to our room. Not necessarily the hotels fault, but an indication of a lot of the clientele we encountered at the hotel.

The cabana room I was disappointed with, considering we paid a premium for that type of room. It had a window which was frosted so we barely had any natural light. We were greeted by a large cockroach running across the floor, which I understand do appear in hot places but was not nice nonetheless! We were close the pool which was its only good point, the walk to the ice machine was a joke. 

That night we went to the party that was going on by the pool, which we did enjoy sitting on the sunbeds around the pool and we could charge the drinks to our room. It was not too noisy, and reception did warn us when we checked in about the event and noise levels.

The next morning we went down to the pool at 11am. I don't know if it was because it was the weekend or if all these events normally occur but they were setting up for another event with booths and signs and DJs booths being set up. This didn't bother us, but there were no sunbeds available. The lady put us on a waiting list and after about half an hour we were given two new sunbeds that they brought out. However, at 2pm we were then told these sunbeds had to be put back away for this event. It would have been nice to have been warned about this earlier in the day or we would have requested two different sunbeds that had just been vacated elsewhere. 

Overall I think it was quite expensive, quite rowdy and busy at the weekend we went. I probably would not stay here again if we were to visit Hollywood. Also there was no wifi apart from in the lobby - I expect most hotels today to have wifi in the room when you pay that much for the room.",,,3.0,3.0,,3.0,,mderoche,Manager,2015-09-21,"Hello CharChelmo, Thank you for your recent stay with us!

Martin S,92,"Leigh-on Sea, United Kingdom",2015-07-31,COUPLES,2015-07-14,3,"Good times, bad times","I'm going to be brutally honest with this review and say that we were disappointed generally with this choice of hotel.

We stayed here for 2 nights on our honeymoon and I can't get away from the fact that we paid an awful lot of money for this holiday - far more than I've ever paid for a holiday and my level of expectation therefore was extremely high.

The first room that we were given failed on a number of counts - it was small, the bathroom was even smaller than small, it was past it's sell by in terms of décor and worst of all, we were kept awake by excessive noise from the rooftop pool and bar which was thumping away past midnight.

Having drawn the attention of the hotel management to our feelings of displeasure, I have to say that they couldn't have done more to put the situation right. We were moved to a beautiful room for our second night. I always do say that it is how complaints are dealt with that show how good a commercial operation is and in this respect, the hotel were magnificent.

Perhaps it is my age, but the hotel seemed overrun with young, trendy types that had had too much to drink and were very loud generally. On one occasion I went to reception because our room key was not letting us into our room and it was full of drunk youngsters with beer bottles littered across the reception area and I had to wait quite a long time just to get our key reprogrammed. Not quite the sort of quality establishment that I was expecting.

Add in the high charges for parking the car and also for the Wi-Fi and it starts adding up (altho in fairness the hotel did waive these charges for me in view of the noise problem suffered).

To summarise, did I think this hotel was good value ? No. Did I think it was good choice for a quiet night ? No. Would I stay here again ? No. Was it in a good location ? Definitely. Did the management look after me ? Yes, they were great and couldn't have done more. But if you want a good night's sleep, I'd look elsewhere.",As far away from the rooftop bar as possible if you want to sleep.,,3.0,,5.0,,3.0,mderoche,Manager,2015-07-30,"Hello Martin S, I am happy to hear that you enjoyed the hotel as far as location and the fact that we were able to take care of you.

Nfenton,98,,2015-06-30,COUPLES,2015-07-14,4,"So Hollywoodish Number 7000 Hollywood Boulevard , How decadant can you get............Ever so at the Cool Pool Parties","Now was the time, a week before departure no accommodation booked, oops better find something quick, haven't done Hollywood for 10 years, this time just me and him in doors, no kids this time, 2nd honeymoon!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Last time was the Beverley Hilton, kids loved it, however looking at it looked isolated and dated, so decided wanted to be in Hollywood, like when I was 20 like a very long time ago.

We needed 3 nights in this location, so searching, decided well it was good enough for Marilyn Monroe for 2 years, maybe OK for me for 3 nights. So we booked. We arrived mid afternoon at LAX, what a shambles and chaos prevailed there!!!!!! Eventually they let us out, ( mind not as backward as Dallas airport ) eventually found a cab, but boy was it boring, nearly 2 hours to get to Hollywood. MR PRESIDENT get a decent public transport system in LA, that will remove some of the cars..............it aint rocket science...

Arrived, checked in, went to the room. Yes spacious, weird entrance though to the area where our rooms were, had to use the hotel key to get through to a corridor!! and you needed an ology to figure out how to open the door!!!!! Big room, queen bed ( I thought everything was big in America)but OK. The bathroom though no tub, so before I unpacked I asked to see another room. High up newly renovated, but didn't like the room, so stayed where we were. No kettle in the room, and only a mini bar, yup they got us a kettle but then had to ask for cups!! As mentioned no tub in the bathroom and the shower was non moveable, it should really have a fixed shower and a hand held one, after all it's not a youth hostel. The manager at the time was Sebastian and a lovely charming guy, who was very helpful, kind and friendly.

It has a pool a lovely size outdoor heated pool, very very pretty, the mural on the base  painted by David Hockney is still there.!!!It's a  proper pool to swim in. They were very strict about no this and that by the pool, however it was fine to sit on a lilo and have a beer, weird!!!!! Heath and safety gone bananas in America...... There were poolside parties every night we were there, which was fun to be a part of, even at our age, our kids would have loved that.

The pool and the location are the best part, especially if you want to be in the thick of it, and feel young and hang out with the young in crowd. Located right on 'Walk of Fame' opposite the Chinese Theatre, and Sephora, and near Ghiradelli Chocolate cafe. The other cafe right on the corner was Coffee Bean, where I was amazed and new I definitely was in Hollywood when a guy suddenly turned into Spider Man..........

There is a subway near there and we used it, not like the underground but better than nothing, but beautifully decorated We actually didn't hire a car on this trip, but there is parking at the hotel, and you do have to pay to park. We used Ubah it was amazing, when we needed to get to places. There are many places to visit nearby including Madame Tussaud, La La Land and Rodeo Drive not too far. We actually travelled to Sherman oaks and              very easily all by using Ubah Cabs.

We had breakfast once in the hotel, it was truly scrumptious.

The hotel public areas were busy most of the time, and that creates a pleasant vibe. However navigating round the place is a little confusing. The staff were friendly and really wanted to make sure everything was OK.

The best thing The Pool and the location. For 3 nights great.............and thanks Sebastian for being great and calming me down",,,5.0,5.0,,3.0,,Reservations T,The Hollywood Roosevelt Reservations Team,2015-07-17,"Dear Nfenton,

g_suttler,10,"Melbourne, Australia",2015-07-31,COUPLES,2015-07-13,3,if you want to party this is the place to be,"It's a party hotel and does it very well but dont expect to be able to relax. Well in my experience anyway. 
We had a room facing the pool 7th floor, its a disco every night with blaring loud music and then there are the after parties in the rooms with people shouting in the corridors, slamming doors and yelling and screaming. 
Over 4 nights we didnt get one good night sleep. The air conditioning was so loud in the room that we had to turn it off and deal with the heat. 
They did give us some free food and drinks off our bill to apologize for the amount of noise and inconvenience, the reception staff were very helpful. 
The good - Tv and tv guide ease of use was great 
beautiful views of LA city and the pool. 
excellent selection of bars and restaurants throughout the venue (although very expensive). 
Good quality wifi free if loyalty member
Nice spacious room (king) , only issue was a small bathroom
Pool area is great for drinks but its open to the public so much that you can rarely find a spot to enjoy as a hotel guest. They seem to treat the public better than they do hotel guests in my experience. 
Location is excellent, close to everything hollywood, runyon canyon is walk-able. 
Bre in guest relations was always in touch to see anything we need before and during the stay, and a welcome fruit platter on arrival was excellent
Room cleaning each day was very nicely done. 
The not so good - Elevators are a nightmare, waiting up to 10 minutes sometimes while it goes up and down stopping randomly at each floor and so small you can only fit in like 6 people at a time, absolutely ridiculous. 
The Noise if you want a good night’s sleep is unbearable if you are facing the pool (even from the 7th floor), be prepared for loud music blaring into your room and in room parties throughout the hotel. 
Air conditioning noise was like a factory industrial noise in the room so we suffered in the heat. 
No tea or coffee in room, $5 for a bottle of water!.
Front desk very busy and often phone not answering. 
Our Safe failed ,the motor stopped working ,with our valuables inside. It took 3 calls to get security to come up and attend to it, each time they said someone was coming but they never did. and then they had no backup safe to replace with either. 
food and drinks very expensive (cocktails $17, beers $9 plus tip)
when its busy at the pool (open to the public) you can rarely get served because the waitresses and bar staff are overwhelmed. 
we had no idea what events were on at the pool, there was no communication or billboard to tell us what was going on. 
Overall its quite expensive to stay here and I expected better.  you need to come with the attitude of partying every night. If you choose the location (like we did) and expect to be able to sleep well each night, this hotel is not for you.","to party stay near the pool, for quiet, stay well away from the pool",2.0,4.0,,,,4.0,mderoche,Manager,2015-07-30,"Hello g_suttler, Thank you for your recent stay with us.

Problem was that we could not access any of the facilities--The Spare Room was not returning phone calls for reservations (it's not managed by the Hotel--Third Party).  When we arrived, we found out their was a private event and we could not enter or get a drink.  Would have been good to know that beforehand.

Also there was a private event at the pool so we could not go to the pool until after 10pm.

They were so worried about taking my car away (which I said not to until I could get my luggage out after I checked in) that by the time I was done checking in, my car was gone. I came outside to get my luggage after checking in and asked where my car was. The head valet guy pointed to a rental V6 mustang and said ""over there"" (my car is a Shelby convertible...head valet should know the difference). After explaining that wasn't my car, it took them longer to find my actual car than the total time I was inside checking in. After one of the guys brought it back, I got all of my luggage out of my car (someone did offer to bring it to my room, but if they could lose my car in 5 mins, I wasn't risking the luggage). As I was walking into the hotel I could hear the valet gunning my car as he took it somewhere to park (it has a loud unmistakable exhaust).

Marie M,7,"Western Australia, Australia",2015-02-28,SOLO,2015-07-09,4,Love the Cabana Rooms,"Enjoyed my experience at the Roosevelt. I arrived at a time where it wasn't too busy, just post Academy Awards (Feb/March) where staff spent the entire day dismantling marquees and stages. I was given a discounted rate for the inconvenience. Staff are very friendly and helpful from point of concierge/valet, check in, food and bev, and Tropicana Bar. I was comped a lunch, beverage, late checkout and cheaper rate for extending booking for a minor inconvenience. Staff were exceptional in ensuring my stay was comfortable. I felt totally safe there. The meals were tasty and good size. The bed was so luxurious you didn't want to leave the room.  If you're interested in touring and seeing sights, then this hotel is the ideal location. I was just happy to enjoy the facilities of the hotel, eat by the pool, room service and walk around the magnificent hotel which has so much character and history. The cabana rooms with balcony, where i stayed, was so comfortable, and great atmosphere overlooking Tropicana Bar, where the chill out music at night is welcoming. You feel like you're by the pool without leaving your room, chilling on the balcony. The wifi is quite slow. Housekeeping can be noisy in the mornings talking loudly in corridors, noisily cleaning adjoining rooms, though they do a brilliant job. I would only ask for a kettle to make tea and coffee in the rooms. It gets expensive ordering a coffee with delivery fee, tax, gratuity and exchange rate.

Then, the night before my arrival, I received an exciting email from Bre saying we had been upgraded to a Studio Double! When I checked in, I found a HUGE room (bigger than my first studio apartment in NYC!) with two closets and two bathrooms! And to top it all off, Bre had sent up a card congratulating me on my impending wedding- AND a bottle of champagne and TWO plates of themed desserts, from bikini cookies to tuxedo strawberries. I was so blown away! As if that wasn't all enough, Bre then called to check on us and make sure we had everything we needed.

We booked the double bed suite for 4 women out on the town to celebrate my sister's bachlorette. We had some LA locals joining the celebrations so in case they needed to crash from the partying, I needed floor space. We got to the hotel early so we checked our bags early as our room was not quite ready.  

As part of my gift to my sister, I also promised one bottle service so that we could have secured seating by the pool. Thanks to Johnny, we were able to get our group hooked up with just 1 bottle for table service because we were celebrating my sister's bachelorette! There was some mild confusion regarding the lounges but once we got to the pool, lounging was the last thing on our mind. We had preferred seating right in front of the DJ with the dance floor and the pool right behind us. We could see all from our fantastic spot. The wait staff were constantly checking in and they took such great care of us. 

When we went up to the room, we had the sweetest note from Bre with a complimentary bottle of champagne, popcorn and ring pops!! All delicious!! We were looking for a weekend of Hollywood Glamour and the suite and view definitely made us feel like we were living the LA dream.

I'm going to be a little too honest, the rest of the weekend was a bit of blur but from what I do remember everyone we spoke with at the hotel was incredibly gracious to our obnoxious, loud group. I am so appreciative of the great service that helped me host a memorable bachlorette for my sister.",,,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,Reservations T,The Hollywood Roosevelt Reservations Team,2015-07-10,"Dear Enna B,

We all loved this hotel! The rooms are spacious, comfortable and well appointed. The lobby is very inviting and everyone enjoyed the liveliness of the pool, bar and restaurant venues. It was fun to hear about the history of the hotel and peek in on the Blossom Ballroom, site of the first Academy Awards; walk the stairs where Bo Jangles taught Shirley Temple to dance; and experience other interesting sites throughout the property. The hotel is perfectly situated in the heart of all the activities on Hollywood Boulevard.  We were fortunate enough to be there on the night of a movie premiere, and we could see the actors and actresses being interviewed on the red carpet from the windows of our hotel rooms!  The hotel staff was fantastic to work with. Sales Director, Juan, is extremely knowledgeable about the area and he helped us plan the perfect itinerary. Guest Relations Director, Bre, coordinated off-property events including a ladies lunch at the Polo Club in the famous Beverly Hills Hotel, group dinner at the beautiful Yamashiro Restaurant, and a VIP Behind the Scenes Tour at Universal Studios. Sr. Conferences Manager, Elissa, tended to every detail to make sure our program ran smoothly and Chef Ernie delighted our guests with specially prepared menus.

It was an amazing stay, everything about the hotel was amazing from the pool to the room. We were fortunate enough to be able to check out the restaurant, where we had awesome food, and then enjoyed an evening in The Spare Room, a quirky and original speakeasy. The Library Room also looked amazing, though we didn't get to have a drink there on this occasion. 

The neighborhood is great, too, with many landmarks including of course the Walk of Fame and the Chinese Theater. It's very central as well, and easy to get a taxi to anywhere you might be hanging out in central / downtown LA.

Would definitely recommend this hotel and hope to be able to make another trip over in future!

The only reason for having 4 out of 5 stars is that they do not offer free wifi in the rooms, which we found very disappointing for such a premium hotel.","Tip: Cabana Balcony had a beautiful view of the pool, not noisy either!",,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,Reservations T,The Hollywood Roosevelt Reservations Team,2015-07-09,"Dear Meredith L.,

The location was excellent and the service at the front desk and the 25 degrees restaurant were top notch.  Unfortunately, the age of the facility detracted from our experience at the hotel.  They only had two small elevators and we ended up waiting over 20 minutes on multiple occasions. We would have been happy to take the stairs but the stairwells were locked because of security so we were forced to wait.  Additionally, the rooms didn't have the usual amenities one would expect.  I like to unpack my suitcase when I stay at a hotel and there were no drawers.  There were a few shelves in the closet but only four or five hangers, which was woefully inadequate.  Additionally, the TV only offered regular channels, there was no on demand or other movies you could pay to watch at your convenience, which seemed strange for Hollywood.  The valet car service was also excruciatingly slow.  We waited over 20 minutes for our car when we checked out.  Additionally there was no jacuzzi near the pool.  While I love the history and location of the hotel, I would not stay there again.",,,5.0,,5.0,3.0,,Bre S,Director of Guest Relations,2015-07-09,"Amy,

Thank you for the feedback based on your past stay with us this month. I am glad to hear that the front desk team and 25' were top notch! Being a building from 1927 we do have older elevators and I know that when you were here there was a lot of up/down. We have taken your feedback for future large groups we have in house to make sure that if guest would like to take the stairs we have that option. We are also looking into storage for our guests rooms as we have received the feedback that guest would like something more than just the closet we provide. Tropicana was not built with a hot tub back in the 1950's and to keep the space authentic we have kept it that way however, some of our guests rooms now have soaking tubs and should you come back we would love to have you experience that.

The decor has a very modern and clean vibe, but not cold at all.  There was a beautiful large dining table as well as a sofa and love seat which made for plenty of seating for our friends who visited after hanging out at the hotel with us.
During the day the pool service was great (love the classy but sexy uniforms!).  Just like the other bars in the hotel, they have great drink selection, as well as several cold pressed juices to nurse a hangover!  The Saturday pool party is definitely not to be missed - hotel guests get lounge chair access so you can sit back and people watch, or join in on the fun :)
All the staff is very friendly when you walk around the hotel and are eager to help, without being overbearing.
The Tropicana bar at night had a fun but chill atmosphere that I really enjoyed.  The Library bar libations are not to be missed - the bartender personally made my cocktail after I told him a few things that I liked.  Very reminiscent of the loungey bars in NYC (where I live).

When we got to the room, we ordered some extra pillows and blankets and they came up without a fuss.  I usually forgo housekeeping services and they were fine with that and honored our wishes.  The staff seems proud of their iconic property which is not lost on folks who love history and Hollywood.

A Historical landmark in itself, film fans will appreciate the atmosphere recognizing the many greats who stayed here in the past.

A lot of events are hosted here (there were at least 3 during my 5 day stay) which makes it a little busy with people coming and going throughout the day. But you'd only notice this if you were indoors and not out seeing the sights.

Me and wife's wedding anniversary was made memorable because of Ms Smiths generosity. Pool food, drinks, ambience over the weekend was on point. Staff was firing on all cylinders. Service was top notch and everyone was courteous and professional. 

The Cabana suite was out of this world Mtv cribs status with plush bed, expensive furnishing, ample square footage, full bar, and a lanai with fireplace  that opens up to the heart of the hotel, the tropical pool area. 

Ms Smith was exceptional with her attention to details. She kept wife's glass full with yummy cocktails, remembered our names and reason for stay and had room service deliver a bottle of bubbly, plate of decadent chocolate treats and a hand written note wishing us a happy anniversary.  Wife couldn't be happier with our experience here.

The hotel is in a great location right in the middle of Hollywood Boulevard.
We were initially allocated a small but very modern and clean room on the 5th floor. The room was nice but we were kept awake by a pool party on the first night and by renovations going on below us. My husband rang reception and was immediately offered another room higher up in the hotel. 
The room we were given was just amazing. It was huge and had a view of the Hollywood Sign to one side and over to downtown LA to the other.
This was a very busy hotel often with filming going on and large reception queues but the staff were the nicest I've ever come across and dealt with everyone with friendliness and efficiency.
I wish I'd got the name of the lady who sorted out our new room to mention her by name but sadly
I didn't however they were all so good. 
We visited the pool bar at night and it was lovely to sit out by the palm trees in the middle of busy Hollywood.

Lauren N,11,,2015-06-30,COUPLES,2015-06-26,5,Fantastic Hotel!!,"We stayed at The Hollywood Roosevelt for the first time and had an absolutely fabulous time. After reading many reviews, we booked a quick two day trip and drove out from Las Vegas.

We arrived at the hotel around 11pm and, unfortunately, the front desk agent who checked us in wasn't the most pleasant. We tried to make small talk with her but she didn't seem too friendly (this was the only negative interaction we had throughout the duration of our stay - everyone else was great!!). 

We booked the studio king and absolutely LOVED it. The room was spacious and clean, and the bed was very comfortable. I loved having the walk-in closet. It felt more like a master bedroom, rather than a hotel room. It was the perfect choice for our trip.

On our second night we had late night drinks at 25 Degrees, the restaurant at the hotel. Our bartender was really friendly, and even made some great suggestions on things to do the next time we were in town.

Upon departure, the valet staff was quick to retrieve our car and even cleaned the windshield for us (such a nice touch!!).

Overall I thoroughly enjoyed staying at The Hollywood Roosevelt. I will absolutely stay here again!!",Book a studio room if you&#39;re staying for more than a day or two - it&#39;s worth the extra money for all the space and the walk-in closet.,,4.0,5.0,,5.0,,Reservations T,The Hollywood Roosevelt Reservations Team,2015-07-06,"Dear Lauren N,

rollerdaddy,9,"Atlanta, Georgia",2015-06-30,BUSINESS,2015-06-25,5,Star Treatment at The Roosevelt,"Earlier this week, I had the pleasure of staying at The Hollywood Roosevelt while I was in LA on a work trip. I've been around the world and stayed in countless hotels over the years and my recent stay at The Roosevelt might just rank as the best hotel experience I've ever had. 

I should preface this review by stating that I am employed as a senior level customer service advisor at a popular consumer tech company based in Northern California. At work, we strive for excellence in everything we do so that our customers have incredible experiences with all of our products and services. That being said, I view the quality of other companies' goods and services with an especially keen eye. 

The tone for my stay at The Roosevelt was immediately set by the valet who attentively offered to help me with my bags as soon as I slid out of my car's passenger seat to transfer to my wheelchair. I'm a paraplegic, so these kinds of gestures carry considerable weight with me.

Once I entered the cool and softly lit lobby, I was struck by three things: the handsomely preserved 1930's decor, the subtle scent of lavender and a soothing blanket of quiet. Man, this was a brochure quality first impression. 

My check in was effortless. Every staff member that I made eye contact with, smiled and greeted me. My accessibility needs were immediately acknowledged as I was helpfully directed toward lifts, reassured that my room was ADA compliant and asked to please inform the staff if any of my needs weren't being met. Nice.

On the way to my room, I was struck by how immaculate every facet of the hotel seemed to be and my room was no exception. It was spotless and the bathroom really sparkled. Now here's where The Roosevelt's level of service became downright uncanny. 

Five minutes after entering my room, I had just transferred from my wheelchair to test drive the super comfy queen sized bed, when the room's phone rang. ""Hi Mr. Lenz, this is (cute front-desk girl's name) Sorry to bother you. I just wanted to make sure that your room is to your liking. Can we get you anything? Oh, and please help yourself to the complimentary bottles of Evian on your night stand. Please don't hesitate to let us know if you need anything."" 

Um...whaaaat? Wow!

This basically sums up how the rest of my stay at The Roosevelt went. I was pampered and doted on the entire time I was there. The stratospheric quality of service was so surprising that I mentioned it to my coworkers at dinner on our first evening in town. Everyone agreed that they were having the same amazing experience at the hotel. 

At one point, Senior Concierge Mark Bell told me that The Roosevelt's unofficial motto is ""to make people feel like rock stars and to make rock stars feel like people"" I gave him a true beneficiary's grin and told him that I knew exactly what he meant. 

Look, I generally don't have occasion to write customer reviews. In fact, this is my first hotel review after 25 years of staying in them. Simply put, The Hollywood Roosevelt is a genuinely impressive establishment. The period architecture and interior design are Golden Era Gorgeous, the spaces are well maintained and the staff is first rate. 

Oh, and the pool will totally blow you away too. Lounging poolside at The Roosevelt feels like you've gone back in time. It's as if it's summer in the early 1960s and you're a particularly well regarded celebrity in the sun. The service and selections from the pool's Tropicana restaurant & bar are equally superb. 

Let me also state for the record that I am not prone to exaggeration. I was one of twenty or so customer service professionals who were staying at The Roosevelt and it was one of the highlights of our trip. 

As our car reluctantly pulled away to take us to the airport, I turned around in my seat to get one last look at The Roosevelt. I couldn't help but wonder if the benevolent spirits of Old Hollywood inhabit the hotel and charm its guests with luxurious spells of good fortune. 

If you're planning a visit to Los Angeles, do yourself a favor and book a stay at The Hollywood Roosevelt. It's reasonably priced and they'll make you feel like a star.

courts_b88,60,"Perth, Australia",2015-06-30,COUPLES,2015-06-24,5,Wouldn't stay anywhere else in Hollywood!,"Los Angeles was our last stop on an 8 week round the world holiday. We decided to stay at the Roosevelt for lots of reasons. It is close to the action, gets great reviews, good facilities, newly renovated and easy access to all the sights and sounds of LA. All of our expectations were not only met, but exceeded!
We checked in with no problems at all. A head's up for travellers - while all the hotels we had stayed in across Europe and the US asked for a 1 time security deposit (between $100 and $300 total) the Roosevelt asks for $120 - $130 per night of your stay. 
I had booked a King Studio Room in the newly renovated section of the hotel and we weren't disappointed! King canopy bed was very comfortable. The rooms are fresh and new, décor is simple but so modern and comfortable. Bathroom is clean and shower recess is massive! All amenities are available. Towels and robes included with a great selection from a mini bar. 
Our room (913) had a GREAT view of the Chinese Theatre, Hollywood Sign, Walk of Fame AND Hollywood High School - a filming location for Grease the movie :-)
There are several restaurants and bars on site, including a 24 hour burger bar and a vintage bowling alley! The hotel itself features beautiful original restored décor, and is the site of the first ever Academy Awards. So much history!
We ate one night at Public Kitchen and Bar. What a fantastic meal! Excellent cocktails and the meal and the service were 5 star. 
After almost 15 different hotels across the world this was the first hotel where we couldn't access free wifi in the room, it was available complimentary in the lobby only. This is the only small thing that stopped me from giving 5/5 for all the categories. We paid less for other hotels that were just as nice and wifi was included. But this definitely wouldn't deter me from staying again, it was easy enough to choose one of the comfortable couches in the lobby or near front desk and use the wifi downstairs. 
The staff were phenomenal. Nothing was too much trouble. The front desk team gladly helped us with directions to Venice Beach and Santa Monica, even printing out Google maps instructions to help us. 
We were greeted by all staff, from housekeeping to valet each morning when we left the room. 
The pool area was lovely, with a bar accessible for food and drinks as well as poolside service. We did want to spend our last two days before heading home relaxing by the pool but unfortunately missed this opportunity on the Sunday due to the pool are being very busy. It gets crowded on weekends due to pool parties etc, so my advice would be to get there early or wait until a Monday. Had no problems getting chairs on the Monday!

The location of the hotel is perfect for all the sights and sounds of Hollywood. Although the room overlooked the Chinese Theatre, we had no problems sleeping at night at all. There’s a pharmacy nearby, convenience stores, plenty of souvenir stores and restaurants as well. Cabs are easily accessible from the front of the building. 
We had a lovely experience on our last morning. Mark Bell, a delightfully friendly and welcoming employee, had a conversation with us as we were sitting in the lobby using the wifi. He then offered to take us on a tour of the hotel, including the conference spaces, restaurants, and even a sneaky look at the penthouse and the rooftop view! We absolutely loved this fun and personal touch, and Mark was an absolute legend, refusing to take a tip for taking time out of his day to show us around. Give the man a pay rise! Thanks so much Mark. 
If I ever make it back to Hollywood I will stay here again and definitely recommend others to do the same. Thank you so much Roosevelt Team!!

Michele048299,1,"Laguna Niguel, California",2015-02-28,FRIENDS,2015-06-24,5,A Birthday Celebration I will never forget!!!,"I recently stayed at the Hollywood Roosevelt to celebrate my Birthday with my girlfriends.  I wanted to share the positive experience I had at this hotel and who made a great first impression. 
 
After calling several hotels in the area, I decided to book a room at The Roosevelt.  When I called back to inquire about restaurants, nightlife etc. the concierge was unavailable so I was transferred to Bre.  Immediately, Bre asked all the right questions and I told her why I was coming to the hotel.  In addition to my Birthday celebration, this was all about having a fun getaway with my girl friends.  Well,  that was all I needed to say to Bre … she immediately introduced me to Albert who got me into AOC when they were fully committed to Nick at Teddy’s who knew me by name and took care of myself and my guests all night.  From the moment we arrived, the valet and front desk employees welcomed us with open arms … Super friendly and directed us to the pool bar to have cocktails while we waited for our room.  The pool bar experience was just as pleasant.
 
I can't put into words the gratitude I have for the special memory that Bre created for me and my friends.  The level of detail she put into this weekend was truly amazing, from a personalized banner to balloons to mini cupcakes etc!!   I too work in an industry where it’s all about first impressions, creating great experiences and lasting memories.  The product can sell itself but it’s the people that make or break the experience. Bre and your team nailed it on all levels!!  Each of them, especially Bre deserve to be recognized for going above & beyond my expectations and providing excellent customer service.  
As we all know, word of mouth is the best advertising so I wanted to share this positive experience since sometimes it’s only the negative ones that get posted.",,,5.0,,,,,Reservations T,The Hollywood Roosevelt Res Team,2015-06-25,"Hi Michele048299,

We arrived at the hotel at 830am and were surprised by an early check in, which is just what we needed after a 14 hour flight! 
As it was our honeymoon, Bre Smith from guest relations went out of her way to surprise us with gifts from the hotel, even as far as a framed picture of our wedding that she had tracked down through Instagram (we presume!) ;) It totally made our stay!! 
We were kindly looked after the whole trip and nothing was too hard for Bre.

We have been living in Los Angeles for the last 6 years and having decided to move the family back to our homeland in Australia, we needed a hotel to stay for our last 3 nights. We have 2 children, 3 and 1 years old, and were delighted at the way we were treated as a family. Many places make you feel like a burden when you have young kids but the staff at the Roosevelt were genuinely welcoming. Moving countries is an emotional experience and my wife was moved to tears when we arrived in the suite and were greeted with a bottle of complimentary wine, a bowl of fresh fruit and a lovely hand written letter. 

We'd like to thank all the staff at the Roosevelt, and a few personally, for making our last few days in LA truly memorable. So Kayla (front desk manager), Blake (bellman), Mark (bell captain), Jodie (front desk), and Charisse & Laurel (pool staff) thank you from the bottom of our hearts and we look forward to staying with you the next time we're in town.

Can't fault this hotel at all! Wonderful and charming property with old Hollywood flair and fantastic staff.
Also the 25 degree restaurant has the BEST burgers in LA, burger number two - delicious patty, pesto, roasted tomato and crispy prosciutto - was just amazing!

Pros:
- 100% perfect Hollywood location, right across from the Chinese and Dolby (previously Kodak) Theatres. Most of the starlike day tours leave from the Chinese theatre too which is handy for visitors. One minute walk to restaurants, shops and bars.

- Great rooms! Big and spacious, nice furniture and amenities. The modern four poster king size bed in the king suite we stayed in made for a nice touch. GIANT walk in shower with rainfall shower heat was a nice luxury. Lots of TVchannels to surf if you're one of those ones that likes to watch something for half an hour or so before going to sleep.

- Good air conditioning and comfy bed

- Reasonably priced minibar and room service 

- Room service food was good and tasty 

Cons:

- Wifi isn't free but it's $36 for up to three devices for 3 days which isn't too bad

- $150 per day incidentals fee taken from your credit card. It's refunded to you when you check out if you don't charge anything to the room or break anything etc. (up to 15 business days to process) but I thought it was a bit excessive given most hotels only charge $50",,,,,,,,mderoche,Manager,2015-06-20,"Hello tashiiiba,Thank you for your review!

One night we stayed on property for dinner at the hotel restaurant and I was really impressed with the menu and the service.
For nightlife we ventured up to the Spare Room and had a great time and the crowd was really good. BUT my favorite place was the Library Bar down by the lobby. It had some amazing mixed cocktails and the ambience was iconic and trendy yet they weren't trying too hard. I'm from NY and a lot of places want this vibe and yet here they didn't really have to work for it...it just felt natural since its such an iconic hotel.

 All of the employees encountered were hard working and took pride in their work. Especially Mark and Mo (valet service) who stood out with their professionalism.
 The Director of Rooms, Ingrid and colleague Bre, Director of Guest Services, personalized my stay. They were very accomodating for my requests for museum trips, sightseeing, recommendations for restaurants, and even a great place for facials. They made it all happen!
  The room was nicely decorated with ample space. Loved the huge shower area and the comfy bed!
  If pool parties aren't your thing, request a room on a higher floor - much quieter.
  Try the Public Restaurant  -  if you like omelettes - frommage with asparagus and mushrooms - delicious!
 Great atmosphere at the Hotel Roosevelt - takes you back to the glory days of Hollywood.
 Will definitely return.

Don't get me wrong the rooms are just big enough.  The rest of the hotel is just amazing.  The history is fantastic.  Make some time just to go exploring. Both of the restaurants have great food.  its a bit pricey but hey ... its Hollywood!  I was there for the Halloween event.  That was just insane.  I was very happy I had a room to go to!  if you like big parties with a couple thousand beautiful people.. then this is the place to be!,"if you don&#39;t have a view of the street, there is a tv channel that has it for you.",,5.0,,5.0,,5.0,Reservations T,The Hollywood Roosevelt Reservations Team,2015-06-17,"Dear penguinsonfire,

Lakisha H,34,"Charlotte, North Carolina",2015-06-30,FRIENDS,2015-06-15,5,Impeccable customer service at a historic hotel,"A college friend and I were looking for a nice hotel, within close proximity of the Hollywood Bowl, transit stations, restaurants and shops in the Hollywood area. I have stayed at several hotel chains on Hollywood Boulevard before, but decided to give the Hollywood Roosevelt a try. This hotel exceeded my expectations on so many levels.

For instance, the staff provided the BEST customer service I have EVER experienced. Even though we had to change rooms during a busy weekend at the hotel, Natalie, the evening manager, made sure we were accommodated for our inconveniences. Additionally, housekeeping and the bellhops were very friendly and professional. We didn't have to travel far for tasty food; there is a cool 24 hour diner on the ground level of the hotel that had delicious and reasonably priced dishes.

A portion of the hotel is being remodeled, but don't let that deter you from staying here. It didn't impact our stay one bit! The hotel decor is a mixture of old Hollywood glam with contemporary finishings.  The pool area was quite exquisite. Once again, I was truly impressed!

If you are looking for a unique but classy hotel experience on the Hollywood Boulevard, I highly recommend staying at the Hollywood Roosevelt. You will not be disappointed!",,,,,,,,Reservations T,The Hollywood Roosevelt Reservations Team,2015-06-17,"Dear Msflny,

The downside was that the room was incredibly small. It was difficult to fit cases around the bed and was even difficult to walk around the bed as there was next to no room. That said it was very modern and clean. We were offered an upgrade at an extra $400 ($100pn) but baring in mind we had already paid just over $1000 for the 4 night stay anyway we didn't bother. 

We tried to get our room cleaned one day but after returning between 4-5pm after being out all day the room still hadn't been cleaned. But we phoned housekeeping for extra towels and they were brought immediately. 

There was some construction  taking place that was very noisy and caused our room to vibrate. After letting the front desk know about our issue they gave us $75 to spend in the hotel which we used pool side to get away from the noise. ",,,,,,,,Natalie G,Manager,2015-06-19,"Dear Jake B.,

The rooms are spacious and comfortable. The pool Area is awesome and gets busy at night if you are looking to have a drink.
The bars in the hotel are also very good and overall with the location this hotel is probably one of the best in Hollywood.
However because of this they feel comfortable and are not going above and beyond to make you feel at home. I had some trouble with mechanical noise in my room and it took me a lot of effort  to change room. I would hAve expect more when I told them I was not able to sleep. Instead I almost got into an argument and the person I talked to refused to give me another room pretexting the hotel was full when it was clearly not. It took me a good two hours of negotiation along with a mechanical guy coming to my room to finally have them give me a cheap room because of this I will not come back... Too bad it has everything you need in Hollywood... ",,,,,,,,Bre S,Director of Guest Relations,2015-06-21,"Arnaud G ,

The hotel is located on Hollywood blvd, across from the Chinese theater. It's a great place to watch people and close to many restaurants. We stayed in a very spacious suite on a higher floor as we don't want to have too much noise and it would be a great option for family with a kid as well. The cabana by the pool may be a lot more noisier. The room was renovated in an industrial chic and very well appointed. Being an old building, there had to be a lot of adaptation so the bathroom was small and narrow but even that was done in a very pleasant way.

We had a good time, but there were a few things that bothered me. I received a text message at 3 pm saying that our suite was ready with the extra towels and blankets I requested, but when we got there (extremely exhausted from a six hour flight) we were told that the room wasn't ready. We had to wait another hour for our room, and they gave us drink tickets and a 75$ credit which was ok, but it was still annoying. We headed to the pool bar for a drink and the hostess told us that we couldn't go to the pool bar because it was a private event and only guests of the hotel were allowed in. When we told her that we were guests of the hotel she said we still couldn't go because they were closing soon (it was 6pm). They tried to give us the same private party speech the next morning when we went down to the pool, but someone else told us we have to get wrist bands as guests of the hotel. I think that these wristbands should be given to guests at check in to avoid these problems, and the desk staff at the pool are very rude. My plans were to hang out at the pool all weekend and if I knew it was such a hassle to go to the pool at a hotel that I paid for I would have stayed at the W. Also, the bed in the king suite is not a king bed.. It's a queen.

I had my two kids, 8 and 10, with me because they were in the wedding.  We were greeted by a very friendly valet staff who quickly unloaded our car. Everywhere we went we were asked if we needed anything. The staff behind the desk made my kids feel special by speaking directly to them and making them their own keys.  Our room was beautiful and super clean.  The view could not have been better,  looking right out at the Hollywood sign and Hollywood Blvd. 
Once we arrived at the pool,  the wait staff immediately brought us frozen grapes and cold water.  The pool was very clean and had lots of great seating. We ordered chicken fingers and a Cobb salad and both were delicious! 
Overall, we could not have asked for a better experience. Mark at Valet went above and beyond for our family and the wedding guests, as did the entire staff on duty at the hotel.

We wanted to get a group of friends together and have a ""LA Weekend"" and the Hollywood Roosevelt was our first thought.  There are so many trendy hotels that are cool one week and lame the next but the Roosevelt has been a steady LA Icon and favorite stop when I'm in the Hollywood Area.  I believe the hotel just recently changed Management and whoever is running it now has got it dialed in!  The service is spot on and hits the perfect balance of luxury high end service with super cool ""anything goes"" vibe.  Everyone from the valet staff (literally some of my favorite guys in the whole hotel) to the pool staff, front desk are all fantastic.  They all provide great service without being stuffy, I literally looked forward to coming and going so I could have a quick laugh or get some great recommendations from the staff.  So many hotels are either too laid back or too stuffy and somehow the Roosevelt Crew finds the perfect balance and just nails it.

We manned up and got a poolside suite and was it worth every penny!  We walked right out from either the Bedroom or the ""bar/living room"" right out to the pool.  It was the perfect place to have a good time!  We barely even wanted to leave the hotel, the suite felt like our own private night club and the hotel was PACKED with beautiful people.  Everyone there was having a good time and you got to see everything from a few vacationing families (that also seemed to have a great time) to Models and even a few Rappers were chilling at the pool.  The pool attendants attitude was ""have fun, do whatever you want to but just don't act like an idiot"".  You wouldn't believe it but it worked, it was a high end controlled party scene all day long.  The drinks were great as well and not too pricy for LA, even thought we had a full bar in the room we ended up getting a lot of drinks from the waitress A. because may friend thought she was incredibly hot and B. because they were worth it.

Jeremy P,146,"Las Vegas, Nevada",2015-05-31,FAMILY,2015-06-06,5,Perfect for a Hollywood Bowl Concert,"We stayed at the Hollywood Roosevelt for 2 nights in May in order to attend a concert at the Hollywood Bowl.  The hotel is perfectly situated for a trip to the Hollywood Bowl, being only a block from the Orange Drive shuttle location, and only about a mile from the actual venue if you prefer to walk. (It is an uphill climb to the Hollywood Bowl, but nice easy walk back, the shuttle is very convenient though).

This is the quintessential, historic, boutique Hollywood hotel.  Just walking in the doors of the lobby brings you back to the days of old Hollywood.  If these walls could talk.  

We stayed in a 500 square foot Studio Double.  The room was huge, beautifully renovated, and had 2 full bathrooms!  There was lots of closet space, 2 big flat screen TVs, and 3 bright, windows that overlooked the entire L.A. skyline.  The provided us with a mini fridge on request (only $10 charge for total stay), and had complimentary coffee and tea in the lobby in the morning.   We also liked the barn doors in the hallway that blocked any noise from the main hotel corridors.  

The pool is very nice, with friendly and accommodating staff.  Despite how busy it gets on the weekends (think Vegas pool scene party), they try their best to accommodate hotel guest with chairs and loungers.  

There are plenty of decent food and beverage options in the hotel, and an extensive room service menu. 

Only slight negative was that our room was not quite ready by 3pm.  We had to wait until approximately 4pm to check in, but it was worth it to get the exact room we wanted.  

By the way, the bell desk and valet staff were awesome despite the busy weekend with weddings and other events in full swing.  I am looking forward to planning another weekend for a concert at the Hollywood Bowl, and a stay at The Hollywood Roosevelt.",Splurge for a studio or suite on a high floor.

We had 2 rooms on the same floor to cover our family needs. The only thing we noticed was that the walls are thin and you can hear people next door quite clearly. The hotel is generally dark but this adds to the historic nature of the hotel. The staff were friendly and I cannot fault them at all. The pool area was a great place to relax during the day (being late autumn it was chilly at night). I can recommend this hotel as it is right in the middle of Hollywood, family friendly and inexpensive compared to other hotels in the area.",,,,,,,,Bre S,Director of Guest Relations,2015-06-06,"dasdad54 ,

AC blew pea size dust balls all over the room, filter was disgusting. Screws missing from the shower drain cover – nasty. No top sheet on the bed, doubt they change the comforter after each check out.

Brent D,9,"Los Alamitos, California",2015-06-30,SOLO,2015-06-04,5,Always a Star . . .,"I have stayed at the Roosevelt three times now, each time almost exactly six months from the previous; and I have posted reviews of each time--people considering a first visit should read my earliest review to know what the experience can be like on a first visit.  As one gets used to being spoiled, obviously the delights of a stay at the Roosevelt become less of a surprise and more of a happy gratification of a hopeful expectation--but that's all good, too:  After all, the confidence in good treatment has a greater durability than the surprise at good treatment, so the exchange is a good one.  But, enough of these abstractions:  I have stayed in a poolside cabana each time.  While it might (and does) get noisy with the festivities going on around the pool, surely that's why you've asked for a poolside cabana--to be, or at least feel as if you were, a part of the fun.  Those who plan to use the Roosevelt just as a base for exploring Hollywood, and so will be abandoning their rooms to gape at Homes of the Stars, you might as well take a more moderately priced room in the hotel's tower (and I can't address that experience); but if you're looking to get away from it all, stay in or nearby your room the whole time, and feel as if you're at a spa with the Beautiful People--heck, you feel as if you ARE one of the Beautiful People (and should act that way)--then go poolside, baby.  Fun things happen there:  I'm sure that a high-level conference between studio execs was going on a few feet in front of my patio for several hours Tuesday evening; and, on my first stay, a photo shoot happened there right in front of me.  Now, I'm used to hotels here and overseas, and normally a room will have a chest with drawers, and you will carefully unpack and arrange everything for your use during your stay.  In the cabanas, at least, there is no such chest, presumably in the interest of giving the guest more space in the room; and, hey--it's not bad at all living out of your bags:  It gives your stay a casual, carefree feeling which sorts well with the poolside ambience.  Aside from continually hitting my head on the hanging globe lamps over the nightstands--my fault (for being tall), not the hotel's--the only problem I've ever had was that the clock in the room seemed not to be working on my arrival.  It was fixed within 45 minutes of my reporting it.  As always, the other guests in the poolside enclave were courteous and dignifiedly friendly; and the staff radiates a feeling of being as glad to see you there as they are themselves glad to have the honor of working there.  Underpublicized is the excellent hotel fitness center, which has a fine selection of well-maintained workout machines as well as dumbbells and a bench, as well as towels for use at the workout.  It's hidden in a corner of the pool area.  There are no lockers at the fitness center, so you'll be walking there in your gym duds from your room (make sure you have pockets in which to carry your room key card, which gives you entry to the fitness facility).  Arriving at the usual check-in time can be somewhat frenetic at not only the front desk but also the valet station, particularly if a pool party is scheduled.  This was the first time I experienced not having a bell-man immediately take charge of my luggage and whisk it away for it to magically appear in my room; in fact, previously the arrival area had teemed with bell-men--by some chance, I don't believe I saw one during my whole stay this time, though doubtless one could be summoned up very quickly in need.  And the main restaurant is now closed on Sundays, which might or might not make a difference to the traveler (one can grab a burger at the other on-site restaurant).  Look like a star, and you will be looked at as if you were a star by the non-guest tourists hanging out for a moment in the lobby; and that makes you feel like a star.  If you have a special occasion or special needs, you are in good hands with the very able and thoughtful director of guest relations Bre Smith, who I can assure you ""does her homework"" thoroughly to fulfill your hopes at the hotel.  And that's how it is at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel:  You are always a star when you are there, and the HRH is always a star for making you feel that way . . .","For a festive atmosphere often well into the night, go poolside; for a quieter experience, ask for the tower.",,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,Kevin B,General Manager,2015-06-10,"Dear Brent D,

The ambiance of the hotel is excellent, but a few niggling details prevent this from attaining the heights it rightly should.  I spent the better part of a week in a poolside cabana room and found a few minor issues.  Room service, house cleaning, the front desk, and bar service were superb, but the room itself was simply adequate.  A few issues - a couple of burned out lightbulbs, a mirror not properly anchored to the wall, and a dearth of comfortable seating in the living area took away from what was otherwise a great room.  At this price point, such details should not be overlooked.  Poolside rooms also have to contend with loud near-nightly parties.  If you are looking for a restful environment, there are better hotels, but for a place to let loose, you won't go far wrong with a poolside cabana at the Hollywood Roosevelt.",,,5.0,2.0,,4.0,,Reservations T,The Hollywood Roosevelt Reservations Team,2015-06-03,"Dear XXXXXVXXXXX,

What should have been a special night - spending $$$ to stay at this hotel for our honeymoon ended up being terrible. 

The night of our honeymoon, my husband and I went to bed after a long wedding day/night and we came back to a lovely hotel room. We were so tired we went right to bed. We didn't turn on the lights, we just showered and then hopped into bed. Now the bed sheets are tucked underneath the pillows so we just pulled back the covers and spent a nice evening together as man and wife. When we woke up, it was just the most horrifying thing you ever want to see. There was THREE dried brown flaky patch around the edge of the comforter that was right up around our faces. Upon closer view, you could tell that it wasnt dirt - it was in fact feces that was dried and caked onto the duvet cover!!!!!! UP AGAINST our FACES while we were sleeping!

We immediately jumped out of bed and called the desk downstairs. They sent up a hotel manager and the manager of house keeping - and all they could say after looking at it (with also their look of disgust) was this is not Hollywood Roosevelts Standards! (You bet its not up to anyone's standards!) They did comp our room. BUT It was just too much. I couldn't fathom staying at this hotel ever again.

Thank you for ruining my honeymoon night.

Oh and - the night before, the bridesmaids stayed in the King Suite - and there is a couch with a pullout bed - well we found wrappers of condoms on the bed. We quickly pushed the bed back into place and slept on top of the couch. - AGAIN - housekeeping has problems.",,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,Sebastian K,Front Office Manager,2015-06-07,"Dear fromLAandHouston,

We do want to apologize for the incident in your room, while I know us telling you it is not up to hotel standards provides you no solace, both myself and our Housekeeping manager were completely dismayed when we saw the status of you sheets. Our room attendants do change the duvet covers with every new guest and we have followed up with our linen company about how this may have happened (as well done retraining with our teams); but we are still in complete shock about how something of this nature was not caught.

The hotel ownership has changed hands and the decor has definitely changed. The Roosevelt has its own signature now and the hallways are much brighter as are the rooms. I'm not sure yet how I feel about this - the dark had a certain special-ness to it.

Brian E,1,"Rochester, New York",2015-05-31,FRIENDS,2015-06-02,5,"Modern luxury, great service and old school cool come together here.","I just returned after an extended weekend stay here.  First off, let me say I was there to party, so my review is viewed through the prism of someone looking for the ideal LA location to setup as my homebase or a partying weekend.  Research led me here, and this was definitely the right choice.

I stayed in a cabana suite, and while it was pricey the room was fantastic.  I intended to leave the hotel more to branch out in LA, but there were so many fun pool parties, bars and restaurants at the hotel that I ended up spending way more time at the hotel than I planned.

I expected the hotel to be modern and luxurious, but one concern I had was that this place would be a hub for pretentiousness.   To my pleasant surprise that wasn't the case at all.  For the most part everyone here was super cool.   Right out of the gate the trip started well, as we were checked in by an alluringly beautiful girl named Jodi who was amazingly friendly and went above and beyond to make sure the room was to our needs.  Throughout the weekend the staff continued to impress me. We spent a ton of time at the pool, and the staff there was very helpful as well.  Some of the friends I was with were a little rude to the staff, and made unreasonable requests, and the staff still kept their cool and went way out of their way to help these people who weren't even staying at the hotel.  Special thanks to Anthony from the pool who really went out of his way multiple times.

Anyway, in summary, this is probably the best party hotel in LA.

Pros:
Fantastic modern renovation to rooms.
Great friendly staff
Awesome pool scene
Good bars, restaurants
Central Location

Cons:
While inside of the hotel is free of all things touristy, if you walk out the door you will be in tourist central
If you aren't there to party, expect the hotel to be loud until 2am or so

If you smoke, there is a section by the valet & really is the place to be if one is a people watcher & likes to meet folks from around the world.  Small but quaint.  It makes up for the non-smoking room in the tower.  Shopping & attractions are close by, too many to name, and all within walking distance.  Want drinks?  The library bar is an experience, but be patient, service will be worth the wait...it's all about you once your turn.  Valet staff is very attentive & friendly.

spazwok,300,"Melbourne, Australia",2015-04-30,NONE,2015-05-31,3,Good but didn't meet expectations,"We stayed in a one bedroom suite at the beginning of April. The location of the hotel is fantastic, right on Hollywood Boulevard surrounded by everything you need. There is a a supermarket across the road, and plenty to see and do all around. We had a room overlooking the Boulevard which was great but can be a little noisy at times. Our room was nice but not as we had expected for the price we paid. It was not well finished, and was missing some key components. The mini bar was not stocked, the phone did not work and overall it wasn't as well presented as it looks online. We did also have troubles with getting our sofa bed made up, and after several trips to the reception to get it sorted, it was finally made well after we requested. 

The common areas of the hotel are beautiful and clean. We didn't use the pool as it was shut for the Fast and Furious premier but it looked great. 

The hotel was very prompt to respond to the survey we completed at the end of the stay. Management very quickly contacted us and offered some compensation for the issues we experienced during our stay. This left a good impression that the hotel reads and takes notes of the survey responses. I was pretty impressed with this. 

I would stay here again because the location can't be beat and I would be willing to see if our issues were just bad luck. Make sure you look around for a good deal, because it is an expensive hotel and probably isn't worth a non discounted price, but with a discount is worth a try.

Let this be a lesson to always keep your bags locked whenever you are out of the room, the money was concealed in our bag (not left out in the open) and yet was still taken- Someone would of had to physically go through our bag to find it.

Checkin was smooth and efficient, bar historic and welcoming, staff attentive and helpful and the overall location of the hotel was perfect. Close to all tourist attractions and a short walk to bars and restaurants.
We were allocated a newly refurbished room but we're very disappointed. Room was very small and once we were both inside with two large suitcases there wasn't room to walk around the bed. The wooden floors looked nice but a bad idea for a hotel, they contributed to the terrible noise from passers by in the corridor, at all hours of the night/morning.  Yes, this is a very noisy hotel so don't come for a good nights sleep, but I guess most guests would be staying here to party and not to sleep....lesson learnt by us. The bathroom was small and quaint but not practical. You turn on the shower and the bathroom gets soaked, totally inadequate shower screen.  Also a lack of ventilation as the bathroom becomes quite tropical and steamy when you shower, turning everything damp within a few minutes.
The pool area does provide wonderful entertainment.  Lots of pretty young people in bikinis and high heels, struggling to stay upright totally drunk in the middle of Sunday afternoon. We witnessed one guest fall on the stairs near the lobby and was totally ignored by hotel staff. His friend tried to help but was met with a barrage of swearing and aggression. 
So, all in all a good hotel in the perfect location for tourists but really it is just a hotel to party if you are one of the ""pretty set"".

executivebooking,1,,2015-05-31,BUSINESS,2015-05-27,5,Graciously Accommodating!!!,"Memorial weekend was coming up fast, and my boss, a c level executive for a very prestigious private organization, requested a room at a hotel in the heart of hollywood. After shopping around at all the majors in the area, I decided on the Roosevelt given its proximity to great restaurants and the fact that my boss had been there many many years before and was curious to see how time has treated the Roosevelt. Luckily I secured the room despite the busy weekend, but the headbanger is that due to changes in business plans, he had to unexpectedly cancel the precious resevation... and then within a day needed the room back again!!! The reservation agents were so gracious and kind, even when my boss was obnoxiously there waiting with his luggage in hand while knowing they had a full house! Major major major props and thanks to the director I spoke with, Bre Smith, who repeatedly assured me not to worry and then pulled through with an amazing room last minute, when I know the hotel had every right to say no can do. I have worked in hospitality several years and am amazed at Bre's charm, smooth handling, and ability to call the shots and make magic happen in a desperate situation. She even went further out of the way to arrange an amenity for my boss - inconceivable how above and beyond the service was!!!

Sandra M,3,,2015-04-30,FAMILY,2015-05-26,5,Had an awesome time,"Me and my daughter planned a trip to LA this spring and I said if we wanted to experience Hollywood that we must stay at the Roosevelt. It's so famous it was pointed out on a tour of LA that we had taken. It's right on Hollywood Boulevard across from the TCL Chinese Theater where stars have put their footprints in concrete in the forecourt. The Hollywood Walk of Fame was right out our front door. Well, let's get back to the Roosevelt. We had originally booked a pool cabana. When we checked in the hotel clerk tried to talk us out of this room because of the noise from the dj that would be playing out there til 2 am. He told us we wouldn't get any rest. He said he'd get us an upgrade to a larger room away from the pool. I was all for that. I'm not a night owl and we would definitely be up until 2. The room was a free upgrade. It had 2 beds, a living area and 2 bathrooms. I told my daughter we should definitely keep this room. I've never been anywhere where one room had 2 bathrooms. They had done an overhaul on the hotel and our room was one of them that had been finished. It was a beautiful room. Very well done. The showers were great. The bed was nice and comfy and fluffy. We ate one day at one of their on site restaurants and the food was excellent. A little pricey like everything in that town but we had the greatest time. The pool was lovely with pool service.

This was the 2nd time I stayed at the hotel, and while I loved my first stay, this time was even better! I stayed in one of the newly renovated King Suites and was not disappointed. The bed was super comfortable. The suite was very spacious (800 sq. ft.) with the bedroom and living area separated by a hallway. The bathroom was appointed with brand new tile and a luxuriously huge shower. 

While the area of Hollywood and Highland is a bit of a tourist trap, staying at the Roosevelt, you don't even notice because the experience is so immersive. 

The pool painted by artist David Hockney is huge and perfectly heated to 85 degrees. The service at the Tropicana pool bar run by the awesome Johnny is top notch and always very accommodating to hotel guests. When I am traveling for work, I don't have a lot of time to hang out, but at the Roosevelt there is always something cool happening, so regardless of what time you are available there is always something to do. Tuesdays is Night Swim at the pool, every second Wednesday there is a Tiki night at the very cool Spare Room and there is always something or other happening in and around the hotel.

I will be reaching out to you with the email we have on file. I am sorry to hear that you did not enjoy your stay with us. Ozzie truly is the best at what he does so it is great to know you interacted with him. We have the complimentary coffee station set up from 6am-9am as we found that there wasn't much traffic for it when we left it out till 10am however, we can look at amenity again. If a guest calls down after 9am we are always pleased to run a cup up to their room. Our renovation is almost complete so we would love to have you back at that point. I look forward to connecting with you very soon.

Thank you for taking the time to provide us with feedback regarding your past stay. Each room is unique in our historic building as no two rooms are the same. Some do have smaller restrooms where others have larger ones. We are looking for a basket for the counter below the sink so that guests can store items there as it is difficult when traveling to not have counter space. We provide two glasses in the mini bar set up but will look at the bathroom as each room does have a gold up for holding your brush but not a rinsing glass. If you would like to visit us again please know that you can ask for me directly and I will make sure to have some extra pillow options and provided you with a larger bathroom.

Recently I attended a business mixer by the pool and decided to stay for another round with colleagues after we wrapped. For the first time I experienced the included (20%?) gratuity and was a bit weary considering I've gotten horrible service at times in the past and generally want to be in control of the amount of tip I leave waitstaff, as we all do. That being said, I was pleasantly surprised to see every staff member on duty this particular night genuinely provided good service, worthy of the included gratuity. One bartender, Lauren, shined especially bright. I told her she reminds me of the ingenue from any and every classic 80s movie - girl next door with a heart of gold that the lead character you just can't live without! I'm interested to see how this new gratuity practice plays out in the long run, but am happy to see this better staff around and look forward to visiting again soon.",,,5.0,,5.0,,5.0,Kevin B,General Manager,2015-05-22,"Zach B,

The food, which would best be described as rustic New American, was treated w restraint and executed very well. The Foïe Gras terrine exemplifies the ethos of the restaurant: terrine, cherries, pickled ramps, grilled bread. Execution and sound flavor profiling make this a standout. Public is a gem, great for date night, business dinner, homie dinner, drinks and offers a stellar reprieve from the madness of Hollywood blvd which lay just beyond the dark oak doors. In short, great food and service in a noir-esque setting.

Ausepa,18,,2015-05-31,SOLO,2015-05-19,5,I wanted to stay longer! ,"What a great experience! I hadn't stayed at the Roosevelt for approximately 15 years, so I had no idea what to expect. 

I was greeted at the car and was assisted promptly by Kyle(?) very friendly and helpful - getting my bags to the room and the days following when passing remembering who I was, a nice touch to a hotel in a big city! 

The room blew me away, totally not what I expected - in the best way possible. I have lots of friends/family traveling to LA over the next 12 months and have already insisted many of them stay at the Roosevelt. 

During my stay the elevators were unexpectedly out of action, but the staff seemed to immediately jump into action which I thought was amazing, compared to what chaos could have come with such a situation. I was on my way up to my room when I was directed to the service elevators and had to leave my room about 30 minutes later, walking out my door thinking ""where do I get out of the building if the elevator is still out of action"" but there waiting was a staff member to put me in the service elevator - it seemed they had someone on every level waiting for guests - really well done! 

A few minor things I had to keep chasing, housekeeping forgot to leave face towels or floor mats 3/4 days I was there. Also a spare box of tissues in the room would have been handy! 

Room service was a bit of a let down. My days were long and I'd usually come back to my room and order dinner. Needs more of a variety. Also on Sunday, don't expect a proper room service menu! It's a basic menu with sandwiches/burgers and soup. There was also no mention of this in the room, I probably would've stayed out for dinner if I had known before getting settled in for the night!

Will definitely be back when I'm in LA next and look forward to seeing an improved room service menu that is 7 days a week full menu! ",,,,,,,,Bre S,Director of Guest Relations,2015-05-20,"Ausepa,

Glad to hear that your reunion with the hotel was a memorable experience! Let's not go another 15 years to see you again. Thank you for sharing the experience you had with Kyle, he does do a great job with all our guests and by far remembering a guest is always the icing on a cake. 

Our rooms got an amazing face lift and we are thrilled to hear that you were blown away! The best form of PR is word of mouth, so thank you. We will make sure all your guests are well taken care of. If I can assist with any reservations please let me know.  

Now, onto the part that made my heart jump with joy! The elevator story- sometimes we run into opportunities in our hotel and it is all about how we respond. The staff did an amazing job ensuring that all our guests felt that there was a genuine care for our guests and that no one felt at a loss or what to do. We have celebrated this great story with the team.  Thank you for your understanding. We also shared the feedback regarding housekeeping needs. Extra tissue has been added onto your profile notes so that we always have for you. We are currently working on our new menus for all outlets including room service.

Until I realized they had a strict guest policy when it came to letting guests in by the pool (which is understandable, because it's Hollywood). I thought I might have a problem on my hands, having invited people already, but the guest service was very welcoming to the idea of throwing a gathering. Naturally they came in high, but in the end to not lose our patronage, they made some very generous accommodations for me and my party of colleagues.

The party was great, by the way. The Tropicana Pool at the Roosevelt is truly a wedge of paradise in the heart of Hollywood.

The check-in process is fantastic (let the bellmen do their thing, that's what they are there for), and the front desk staff was very nice and quick.  We asked for a room over the pool (knowing it would be noisy) and we loved it.

The rooms are modern, with a nod to the classic/vintage style of low beds, lava lamps, and modern throwback furnishings. The hallways have fantastic old photos of LA-lifestyle.

Cons:  The rooms aren't soundproof, and the decks over the pool do not offer much privacy. But we were FINE with it.

Pros:  You feel like Carey Grant and Audrey Hepburn when you walk out to the pool and have a drink. The water is lit in a very cool blue, and the evening feels wonderful outside. Also, Hollywood is not a great area to stay, and this is right in the thick of things so you can quickly escape into your oasis from the busy/dirty/crowded push of Hollywood tourism.

Af1979,8,,2015-05-31,COUPLES,2015-05-14,4,Good hotel,"Myself & my husband stayed for 3 nights at this hotel & it was great. Location was perfect with  all the typical Hollywood sights being in easy walking distance. We ate breakfast every morning at the 25degrees restaurant and couldn't fault it. Food and service was excellent. The bar area at the Public Library restaurant was also very good.
We stayed in one of the  cabana rooms and it was lovely. Plenty of space and nice and bright. My only gripe, which I think should be highlighted at check in, is that these rooms are very noisy at night. Especially on a weekend. They are situated adjacent to the pool and on both the Saturday & Sunday night we were there, there were people shouting in the corridor and slamming doors and generally creating a lot of noise:This went on until at least 3am which coincided the pool bar closing. Wasn't a major problem for ourselves, but as a travel agent in the UK, I will definitely advise clients about this when they book and recommend a tower room if they are older or light sleepers.
On a weekend, there is a DJ who plays tunes at the pool during the day. This was great and created more of an atmosphere around the pool at daytime.
I would definitely stay here again if I went back to LA and would recommend it but I do think people should be advised either at time of booking or at least when checking in, that the cabana rooms can be noisy at night during a weekend. This gives people the option to pick an alternative quieter room type if this is more suited to them.",,,,,,,,Bre S,Director of Guest Relations,2015-05-21,"Af1979 ,

Thank you for your feedback regarding the cabana rooms. We have reviewed with our front office team the importance of highlighting our DJ programming. We will also be created a information sheet for the guests rooms so that everyone knows what is activated in the hotel/cabana area.

I cant fault that hotel for that - avoid the Cabana rooms if your looking to relax early and sleep early - Tropicana bar very noisy and lots of people who are way to trendy for there own good hanging about congratulating themselves on being wonderful and pretty. But - if your looking for that sort of thing, then this Hotel is for you.

We are defiantly in the heart of it all and being the heart we do tend to pump a lot of energy out! Our tower rooms are a fantastic choice for travelers looking to stay in a building that is almost 90 yet has had a face lift or two in her day. Our cabana area defiantly can be eventful but then again, that was where Marilyn Monroe spent her days. It is amazing how you can be inside the hotel with all the amenities and forget that the blvd. is right there, then you walk out and think ""WOW"" there is a lot going on out here. It is a place where everyone wants to be seen and heard. I agree about heading west however, there is still some pretty neat history on that blvd. that everyone should enjoy.

Bob A,19,,2015-05-31,SOLO,2015-05-10,3,Where's the dresser?,"Let me start by saying the desk staff was very courteous and friendly. The hotel has undergone a renovation since I was last there many moons ago. The decor was quite eclectic in the room which was rather small, what I'd summarize as ""shabby-chic."" Wooden floors, unmatched odd pieces, some painted, and light fixtures with cords hanging down. After scouring the room for drawer space I realized there wasn't any other than tiny ones in the night stands. I literally had to live out of my suitcase which I had to keep on the floor since there was no luggage rack on which to place it. Never have I stayed at a hotel or motel that was devoid of drawer storage. This was a big minus, and the bed was a ""four-poster"" with the posts being made of straight metal, a definite hazard in the dark of night. The first night the air conditioning was not functioning so I sweltered until morning. Upon calling down to the front desk that next day, someone came by and got it running properly

I was there for two nights. The first one the main restaurant was closed for a private party, with the alternative being the 20/25, a 24-hour counter-style eatery open to Hollywood Boulevard. The staff there seemed more interested in talking among themselves and watching the plasma TV than focusing on the customers. 

For the approximate $300 per night I had expected something better.",Try for rooms not facing Hollywood Boulevard. It&#39;s a zoo out there!,2.0,5.0,,,3.0,,Bre S,Director of Guest Relations,2015-05-21,"Bob A ,

Right on Hollywood Boulevard, stars and all, as well as opposite the Chinese Theatre. As with most things American you end up entering through the slightly uninspiring car park, but the pool area and Spanish colonial inspired lobby more than makes up for it. I stayed in one of the Cabana Suites which had a fantastic view over the palm tree lined swimming pool, complete with the beautiful people of LA. Noisy as hell, the cabanas were built in the 50s and I'm not sure insulation was top of the agenda....if its not people by the pool then its footsteps in the corridor...elephants by the sound of it. Don't let that put you off as the atmosphere is incredible and there's always some exciting Hollywood shoot going on...also the hotels in a lot better condition than a number of other high profile, and more expensive, Hollywood hotels.

Alexander B , 
Thank you for taking the time to share your experience with us! We just got Charlie Chaplin back to our car park which I think you truly would have enjoyed and creates a piece of Hollywood History right at the arrival. Did you know our guests use to enter on the boulevard in the early 30's to 50's however once the boulevard started to become so busy and popular we had to move it to the back of the hotel. Our cabana suites while only having 5 are pretty amazing. We are in the midst of our renovation in the 1927's tower where we are taking on some of the things that were not at the top of anyone's agenda during that time. We then plan to head out to our pool area as we agree there is some 2015 items we need to enhance. At the end of the day impeccable service means the world to us so thank you for that raving comment!

But that said the rooms are adequately sized a place to sit and plenty of room for luggage. Remember this hotel was built many years ago when rooms the size of what you get in Vegas where never thought of.
The staff are great never afraid to meet a request and always willing to offer an advice on a tour or how to catch local transport.
When staying check out all the bars and restaurant , and even if passing by a good place for a feed or drink.
As for location you can't go wrong right on Hollywood Blvd, close to tours and the metro station (Highland/Hollywood).
So if you want to experience some history and nostalgia of Hollywood stay here, also keep an eye out for a celebrity or even a film/Tv show being filmed in the hotel.",,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,Sebastian K,Front Office Manager,2015-05-12,"Dear Carneyman,

We are delighted to hear you enjoyed your stay at The Hollywood Roosevelt and our location. You are correct, some of our standard rooms run smaller due to the hotel's original architectural design back in the late 1920's. However, we have more upgraded rooms like our Studio Kings and our King Suites which offer a bit more ""modernity"" in terms of spacing and layout. For your next stay please feel free to reach out to me directly and I will be glad to help with your booking.

First off, you MUST speak to Shanelle in reservations.  Shanelle is so charming and lovely and warm.  I connected with her on such a personal and human level that when I hung up the phone, I felt like I had spoken to a long-lost friend.  I was so smitten with Shanelle, I immediately emailed the Roosevelt and said that if my stay were ANYTHING like my initial phone call, I was in for the vacation of a lifetime.

And The Hollywood Roosevelt proved me right, over and over.

My room was indescribably gorgeous.  Just stunning.  (I suspect Shanelle helped arrange for my room, but EVERYONE was so wonderful that, at this point, I have no clue.  I just know that my room was spectacular.)

Bre Smith, Director of Guest Relations, is a shining star.  Truly, the BEST.  Every day, she went out of her way to make me and my friend feel special and appreciated.  She emailed recommendations to me, catered specifically to what I wanted to experience in LA.  She checked on us constantly and arranged for special treats to make us feel extra-special and appreciated.  Bre DEFINES stellar guest relations at a luxury hotel.

V, the gorgeous hostess at the pool, is a total doll baby and she is funny and sweet and so accommodating.  She made sure we had everything we needed at the pool.  

Sophie and Millie at the front desk are absolutely lovely.  

I don’t drink alcohol so the server at the pool went off the menu and made a frozen watermelon and mint drink special for me, after I described my favorite flavors.  

A sweet bartender at 25 degrees bought us a malted milkshake one night, just because.

Every time we discussed leaving the property to sight-see in LA, we decided that there was nowhere else that we would rather be than the Roosevelt.  We cancelled dinner reservations at the Chateau Marmont and Cicconi’s because we just didn’t want to leave the property.  

I have traveled extensively in Mexico, Europe, Asia and the Middle East and no hotel has ever matched my magical experience at the Roosevelt.  Across the board, the staff is amazing. The service is unparalleled.  The food is delicious.  The rooms are luxurious.  

If you want to really experience what it’s like to live like a celebrity in LA, stay at The Hollywood Roosevelt.",They cater to your specific needs - read my review.,5.0,5.0,,,,5.0,Reservations T,The Hollywood Roosevelt Reservations Team,2015-05-06,"Dear anissa a,

Had to go back to the front desk after an embarrassing trip to the 5th floor from another hotel guest's card. After this was corrected, we got to the room. Nice view, but the room wasn't really clean. See pics of bathroom floor. No carpeting, so it was probably just dust-mopped (they missed a few places). Walls in shower had someone's shaving cream residue left behind, complete with whiskers. Should have taken a pic of this but didn't discover until I was taking a shower later. We changed and went to the pool- completely packed and was told we could put our name in on a wait list for a pool chair. The restaurant poolside had another 30 min to an hour wait and it was suggested we could have a drink at the bar and wait (it was 2:30 in the afternoon- didn't want to start that early). As we were walking away, someone chased us down and said there was a table that ""just opened up"". Bed was fairly comfortable and the two extra pillows we requested showed up while we were out for dinner. Reported this all to the front desk upon checkout. They wound up comping our meal we had by the pool (normal dinner salad-sized cobb salad with no meat and an order of fries will run you about $35). They said they limited pool guests to people staying at the hotel (idk...). May try it again, may not. There's alot of choices for hotels in this immediate area and for almost $300 after all applicable taxes, not sure it was THAT worth it.",Make sure if you choose a room near the pool you are aware of the noise.

     Bre Smith was so professional, and went out of her way to arrange reservations for us and make our trip very special.  We were greeted with champagne, desserts, and a Happy Birthday note in our room. I had spoken to Bre via email prior to our trip, and it was such a pleasure to finally meet her. I can't say enough about her kindness and hospitality.
     The Hollywood Roosevelt has a beautiful lobby, and it's always buzzing with activity. While we were staying there, movies/commercials and such were being filmed there. There are various bars/social settings to choose from at The Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel.  Teddy's was a wonderful bar and dance club that we visited on Friday night. The Library Bar is a quaint bar where you can watch the bartender utilize the fresh herbs, fruits, and vegetables (located on the bar) to create your drink of choice. The Spare Room gives you an opportunity to go bowling and socialize at the bar. Probably the highlight of social time is The Tropicana Pool Cafe, located at the famous Hollywood Roosevelt pool. 
     Our room was upgraded to a King size bed, which was so amazingly comfortable! There was a fully stocked refrigerator with both alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks, plus snacks. We loved the walk-in shower! Our view was amazing! We could look out the window and see the Hollywood Sign, plus a fabulous view of Hollywood Blvd., The Walk of Fame, and the TCL Chinese Theater.
     Speaking of our room, room service was impeccable. Everytime we made a call, we had someone at our door within minutes. I utilized the dry cleaning service. The rates were reasonable, and they did a great job. We also ordered food on two occasions. The food arrived quickly and tasted amazing! 
     Location, location, location!!! The Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel is right on Hollywood Boulevard where the Walk of Fame is located. You will also find the TCL Chinese Thester, Dolby Theater, and El Capitan Theater all within walking distance.
     I highly recommend staying at The Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel. My best friend and I will have memories to last a lifetime thanks to The Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel and Bre Smith, Director of Client Relations!",,,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,Reservations T,The Hollywood Roosevelt Res Team,2015-05-04,"Greetings FabulousLaLa,

Wish the staff matched.,"I believe this is one of the best locations to say at to truly experience what Hollywood has to offer. I stayed in the Cabana Suite for two nights. I will admit the room is one of the nicer rooms (other than mattress quality) I've stayed at in Hollywood. The glaring downside was the staff attitude. It always seemed as if I was bothering them or inconveniencing them by asking simple questions like what the WIFI was. The only nice staff I had on the trip was the housekeepers.

thefancytraveler,1,"New York City, New York",2015-04-30,FRIENDS,2015-04-24,5,Crown Jewel,"Several years had past since I had visited the Roosevelt Hotel but with a girls trip on the horizon, I was eagerly anticipating the opportunity to get relax and enjoy the Hollywood landmark. It is my understanding that the hotel recently changed management groups but don't worry everyone, this seems to be for the best and the improvements are already beginning to shine. 

As a frequent traveller, i have found that you can provide me with the most beautiful room (btw the remodeled rooms are lovely but stay away from the poolside rooms is you are expecting silence) but if you don't personalize our interaction and remain robotic, i'll pass on the stay next time. This is why I will always recommend the hotel to people interested in staying in Hollywood. The service is on par with the many other ""high-end"" luxury hotels and for the price point, a steal as far as i'm concerned. From Ozzy at valet (thank you for always remembering me and greeting me with a giant smile) to Sophie at the front desk (your patience with our numerous inquires was greatly appreciated) and lastly the shining star of the hotel, Bre (your poolside service and subsequent assistance was more than anything we could have dreamt of and the card was simply over the top).

As far as food is concerned we ate at the burger restaurant and everyone was quite pleased although my only complaint remains with the poolside options. As a vegetarian I found the menu offerings to scant and would have expected some dietary accommodation to by made.

Lauren C,1,,2015-04-30,FAMILY,2015-04-23,4,A nice hotel that fit our needs.,"The staff was very friendly and accommodating.  The pool was very relaxing and the staff was extremely attentive until the afternoon when non-hotel guests started arriving to ""party"" at the pool.  I was with two 13 year olds and did not feel that the atmosphere was appropriate.  We also smelled marajuana.  There was a lot of smoking around the pool, as well.  The area right outside of the hotel was very busy and we were constantly solicited by tour operators.  It was very annoying, but that had nothing to do with the hotel.  Overall, the room was very nice, the pool itself is very nice and we did enjoy the stay.  I would definitely go back again although I am not crazy about the area surrounding the hotel.

Diego1,12,,2015-04-30,SOLO,2015-04-22,5,Very impressive!,"On a whim I decided to spend my birthday at the Roosevelt and I have to say that I was very impressed with everything at the hotel. Great food and cocktails at the pool area and of course a copuple more in the little bar off the lobby. Every person I came into contact with, from the valet to the waitstaff, went out of their way to make me feel like I was the only guest they were there for. I didn't have enough time to explore everything at the hotel but I will definitely be back! 

One thing that was I really liked was the bar where they create a cocktail based on what you are in the mood for at the moment. I had no idea I was in the mood for a wild arugula, agave nectar and gin cocktail (I know it sounds strange) but it was one of the better cocktails I've had in a very long time.

It is very clean and the staff are very very friendly and helpful although perhaps a bit shorthanded when it comes to retrieving your car from the parking lot or your suitcase if you've checked it before checking in.  I was given a cabana room right next to the pool.  If you're in your 20s or 30s this might be your ideal room, but with d.j.s playing many nights it's much too loud to enjoy a good night's sleep.  After having a drink by the pool on the first afternoon I was there, I realized a room in that part of the hotel would be a nightmare.  The woman at the counter was very courteous and move us to a room in the tower that has a barn door-type slider that blocked all the noise from the hall.  What a great idea.  The pool is almost always crowded and spare lounge chairs are scarce so you need to get there early if you want to spend any time at the pool.  That would be my biggest complaint, but that's not a big one.  This is a lovely place to stay",Choose a room by the pool if you&#39;re into partying into the night.

STLjulie,17,"Saint Louis, Missouri",2015-04-30,FRIENDS,2015-04-21,3,Room Bait-and-Switch was a Turn Off,"You can't beat this location if you're looking for a historical property in the heart of Hollywood proper.  It's also a great party, party, party location if that's your scene.  Money rules, here, though, so be prepared to pay a lot  for everything.  In my case, even for upgrades for which I already paid.  In fairness, though, the staff did a great job in attempting to make it right after the fact.

When I booked on-line, I chose an upgrade to a cabana room.  At check in, I asked if a cabana room with direct pool access from the room was available.  I was told there was one left, and I was given the room number and told it was mine.  I was told the room wasn't clean yet, and I would be called when it was ready.  After leaving for several hours and not getting a call, I returned to the hotel.  A different person was at the front desk and told me the room I was put in was no longer available.  But, he had an even better room for me, he told me.  I get to new room, and it was not near the pool with windows facing --nothing.  As I was returning to the front desk, the person who originally checked me in stopped me and asked how I liked the room.  I told her what had happened, and she said she would look into it.  She came back and said essentially no pool rooms were left but she could still keep me in a cabana room for an additional $175.  She knocked that down to a lesser amount, but does it really matter if it's an additional $1 or $100 -- this is not what I was told when I checked in, and I'd already paid an additional amount when reserving the room for an upgrade.  Lots more waiting, and I eventually wound up in an upper floor room (no direct pool access like originally promised) with a view of the pool.  It was presented to me as though the hotel was doing me a big favor because it was not going to charge me an upgrade fee (I had actually already paid an upgrade fee).  There were some rumblings about not choosing the right cabana level, the original girl who booked me didn't know the hotel layout very good (I don't work there -- how am I supposed to know which employees mean what they tell the customers), etc.  They did buy me a drink while I waited for the situation to sort out.  I appreciate that.  My luggage eventually showed up in the new room several hours later.  Things happen.  Sure, but this was kind of a turn off.  It felt like I wasn't important, so my pool room went to someone else.  It also felt like they were trying to get more and more money.",,2.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,Sebastian K,Front Office Manager,2015-04-21,"Dear STLjulie,

My only complaint is the ""Hollywood"" location, I personally wasn't a fan of the walk of fame and how busy it was although it was close to a lot of landmarks, there were plenty of cabs around however if you are not in Hollywood it is difficult to find a cab back.

Jared G,2,,2015-04-30,COUPLES,2015-04-19,4,"Cool building, questionable charges and NOISE.","Great old school Hollywood charm, super nice staff, cool bars and restaurants. But any room near the pool area gets BLASTED with awful music until midnight on weekdays, and 2am on weekends. Unless you're doing blow all night and don't intend to sleep or watch TV - that part SUCKS. Stay in the tower, high up, and facing Hollywood Blvd. 

Also, there is no usable Wi-Fi unless you want to PAY for it. Even Motel 6 has free wi-fi, it's ridiculous the Roosevelt doesn't offer the same. Also, the TV cable system is the worst. Complete pain in the butt, and many channels are distorted and unwatchable. Seems like it should be a basic amenity, without having to fork out more money. 

Overall, a really nice building. But the stuff you would get even at a crappy hotel for free? Not here. Not at all. ",,3.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,Ingrid B,Director of Rooms,2015-04-28,"Dear Jared G,

Thank you for your comments on your recent stay. It is nice to hear you got a chance to experience our ""old Hollywood charm"" as well as our unique variety of options to dine and drink in. I am sorry to hear however you did not enjoy the music out at the pool. Generally until we get in our summer programming months out at our Tropicana Pool we have our house music on weekdays and a DJ on the weekend nights and change the DJ's quite frequently. We do offer standard wifi complimentary but currently higher speeds are at an additional fee. As we look to always keep current in the industry and take our guest feedback to heart we are constantly looking at options to improve on those things that important to our guests and keep them returning so I appreciate your input. We offer newly renovated rooms in the tower that sound like a great option for you should you decide to return.

Amy J,11,,2015-03-31,FRIENDS,2015-04-19,4,"Had issues, 4 stars is for wonderful front desk agent Sam","First of all, we were upgraded by the front desk to a cabana room, which was very nice but noisy due to the music by the pool. I won't go too much into detail but when we called the front desk, Sam was so sweet and tried his best to help us with the situation. He is the reason I'm giving 4 stars. I was very pleased with the way he handled my complaint and he deserves to be praised for his good customer service. The cabana rooms are a lot of fun but do get noisy at night, if that's your thing, request one of those rooms. 

We did not have a good experience by the pool, I ordered food and one of the dishes took one hour to come out, only to find out they didn't put the order in. When we finally got it, it tasted terrible ( some turkey panini with ranch) I told the server and they took it off the bill but were not apologetic, a blonde server that did not even smile at us. I would recommend to the food and beverage dept to train your female servers to be kind and warm to females and not to just cater to the males watching them in the skimpy bikinis. 

Overall my stay was just ok. This is definitely a party hotel but it's right in the center of hollywood so it's extremely convenient.

Thank you for your feedback on your recent stay. We do admit as you experienced that while our a rooms are a lot of fun because of their proximity to the pool and the action they can be on the louder side especially when we have our nightlife programming engaged in the warmer months. We do however offer multiple room types and this way as a guest you can enjoy the pool but then retire to your quieter room in our tower when ready to wind down for the day. We will certainly look into your feedback provided about the service at the pool. As you can see with your interaction with our manager Sam we pride ourselves in our employees and want all of our staff to provide the same high caliber of service so I apologize that it was not consistent in all areas. I will be certain to share your wonderful comments with Sam, he will be thrilled to hear.

Service was really good from valet to check out. Perhaps it is because I am now 50 but while fun, one night for me in this area was enough. For me it was like staying in times square NYC. Very touristy but indeed convenient.

We enjoyed being on the walk of fame, the hand prints at the Chinese theatre and my daughter got pics with the Americas Got Talent judges, literally across the street doing a red carpet appearance.

I love walking through the doors from the hustle and bustle of Hollywood Blvd, into old Hollywood. The Painted ceilings, the hushed atmosphere, the crescents of wine-colored sofas and the inevitable Hollywood folks at the bar and in the restaurants make me feel as if I'm about to be discovered. I was there this week for lunch (see my review of the Public Restaurant) and at the booth behind us a reality show was being filmed.  After lunch, I did a turn around the pool (ask for Sergio at the bar - in a bevy of fantastic employees he is just the best). I could have stayed all day. Alas, work called.

Mary F,53,"Souderton, Pennsylvania",2015-03-31,SOLO,2015-04-10,3,"Lovely, Beautiful, not Practical","Ever see a place that'e beautiful but completely impractical?  Not a hook to be found in the bathroom and only one shelf - which is taken up by your towels, your sink, a few amenities.  There are no hooks anywhere - they kindly offer the complementary use of a lovely terrycloth robe but give you nowhere to put it but but the bed, floor, chair.  No reading lamp - just two large, high globes which cannot be individually controlled.  Lots of gadgets but no information about how they work.  No little diagram of the hotel to help you get oriented and find what you need.
It is beautiful, and, of course, historic.  Two staff members were out-of-sight helpful - Joanne at reception was a delight and really wanted to accommodate the customer.  She is a star.  Tony greeted people, stored luggage and did most anything you could think to ask -- or he could think to offer.  Never had better service anywhere than I did from those two people.  Others could be arrogant and condescending.  Room was super some days and just awful others.  Sunday no one came until around 4:30 in the afternoon - but I had to ask.  One restaurant is open 24 hours with not much of a selection and charges only $15 for a not-too-good hotdog and $6 for a beer - worse yet, goodness, they were out of Guinness!  Mind you - I was there for 1/2 price happy hour!
The other restaurant looked a bit more upscale, but their hours and mine didn't mesh.  I did go in to look at the menu and the prices were upscale but the menu was just on a sheet of paper - like maybe they don't plan to hang around.
Yes, the patio and other rooms near the pool can be loud - and loud into the night, but that's the trade-off.  I believe the tower rooms are quiet.","I had a patio/cabana room.

I picked the hotel because of the are and their reputation for having a good pool.  I was able to secure a great rate through their website as we are Canadian and they offer a foreign discount.  Check in was excellent, the Valet was quick and efficient and they honoured our request for a high floor with a view of the main street.  We had requested a higher floor as we would be checking out mid morning and didn't want to be woken up early.

Since we were staying on a Sunday night, the hotel didn't have a few of their lounges open which would have been nice but we had reservations elsewhere for dinner so it wasn't a problem.  

The room was comfortable, clean and quirky enough with a four post bed was a good touch.  Our room had recently been redone so it had all their new touches. 

The only downside is that we were woken up in the morning with construction noise and were disappointed that we weren't warned the evening before.  We called down to the front desk and asked if they could do something about the noise and they said they couldn't but would extend out check out time for the inconvenience which we declined since we had to head to the airport mid morning, so they promised a credit upon check out.  When we checked out we were credited for over half the cost of our stay which was satisfactory.

Some of it because I love the location, mostly I love the comfort and the food.  One of my favorite restaurants, Public's Kitchen is here. I can't really go to LA without at least one meal at Public's.  Beacher's madhouse in the basement is a good time to, but not for those with thin skin. My only complaint is the elevators suck.  They are cute and historic, but it gets really really old when you have to wait to get to your room or downstairs more than a few minutes.  Some of it is the elevators, some of it is the fellow guests who are to stupid to operate them.",,,5.0,,4.0,4.0,,Reservations T,The Hollywood Roosevelt Res Team,2015-06-14,"Hi Warren A,

I am hardly exaggerating when I say that the dining experience at Public Kitchen & Bar is some of the very best that I've had the chance to savour in my years of fine dining all over the world.  Executive Chef Vincent Cachot has done wonders in transforming this hotel's restaurants into a must-dine venue in Los Angeles, whether you're just visiting from out of town or for that special occasion.  Awesome ambience with sophisticated elegance !

After dinner, head on downstairs for some relaxing pool-side drinks or if you're up for some wild, crazy fun, try to get into Beacher's Madhouse.  No words can describe this club.  You'll just have to experience the entertainers, the beautiful people and the shockingly fun stage-acts for yourself.

Lucinda B,40,,2015-04-30,FRIENDS,2015-04-07,2,My stay at the Roosevelt ruined my holiday,"I recently stayed at The Roosevelt and it was hands down the worst ""hotel experience"" of my life. The hotel had renovations happening and we were placed in a room that seemed to be directly underneath the renovations. We were woken up at 7am every single morning by what sounded like 1000 lawn mowers and a jackhammer next to our head. Upon checking in we warned that there may be some slight construction noise, but this noise was anything but slight. The fact that I was actually paying THEM (full price at that) to be staying there and not the other way around is what was really absurd. 

Don't waste your money - stay somewhere else where you won't be in the middle of a full blown construction site. I promise I am not over exaggerating when I say our room was shaking from the bangs. Upon complaining about the noise, all we were offered in the way of compensation was free valet. Sorry Roosevelt - not good enough for a ruined holiday. 

The best comments I have about this place is that the valet staff were incredibly friendly, and the pool area / bar was great. ",,,,,,,,Ingrid B,Director of Rooms,2015-04-09,"Dear Lucindy92,

What a classic LA experience. It's a BEAUTIFUL historic hotel, with staff that is willing and able to tell you all about the architecture and history of the place. But also, it's a hotel that offers a variety of environments in one:
- It's right off the walk of fame, so you can knock that off of your to-do list while visiting
- The pool bar is super posh, with poolside fireplace when it gets chilly. It was too cold to swim when we visited, but we heard that the pool swim nights during the week are the best. 
- There's another bar that feels very old-Hollywood. Sort of like a speakeasy feel. It's full of old board games, a vintage bowling alley (that you can play on). 
- There's a library bar - that feels like the dark smoking room from a rich man's mansion. Very mysterious. We spotted Nicole Richie having a smoke outside this one - dressed to the nines in her fur coat. The staff said that this hotel is prime for celeb spottings.
- There also a really exclusive club there - Teddy's. Expect a line, but also expect to feel like you're a VIP once you get in. 
- We ate at the Public Kitchen. Their Kale salad is insane. Best I've ever had. But I can't brag enough about the brussels sprouts! I seriously have been trying to find a recipe similar to them since I've gotten back home. Sooo good. Highly recommend eating here. Service was awesome.

Vowed to return someday as a guest. Well, it was the TCM Film Festival that brought us back, and the pool did not disappoint, nor did the rest of the hotel. While the lobby was crazy busy during the festival, arrival and registration are discreetly located on a lower level, so it was possible to quietly check in and take the elevator to the 8th floor and never realize that there was a major event going on. Nice arrangement.

We knew that the Oscar awards shows were first held in the Blossom Room at the Roosevelt, but never dreamed we would be on that fabulous stage. All of the public rooms have been kept up beautifully, and the restaurants - both 25 Degrees (great mussels, steak) and Public Kitchen & Bar (eggs benedict, bloody mary's) were fabulous. Across the street was the Chinese Theater and several blocks away the Egyptian. We were about 4 blocks from the Magic Castle, home to every magician in America. In other words, you are smack in the middle of most sights; the hotel is located directly on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

On a more practical note, there is a CVS one block away and a Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf across the street if you would like to fetch your own breakfast, soft drinks, wine, etc. There is also free coffee and tea at Registration each morning; nice to take to the pool with the complementary New York Times or LA paper. 

We saw lots of stars on our visit - Shirley McLaine, Christopher Plummer, Spike Lee. We lounged at the pool in the evening where the hotel screened Grease to our delight. 

We have visited Hollywood before, staying at the Beverly Hills Hotel and the Four Seasons, but never enjoyed ourselves as much as when we stayed at the Hollywood Roosevelt.

The festival get more and more popular every year and tends to sell out all hotels in the area therefore prices tend to be higher during that week.
