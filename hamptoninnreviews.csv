Christian Patri... A,1,,2021-11-30,FAMILY,2021-11-30,5,"Convenient location, clean facilities, friendly staff. ","Place was convenient for our needs and staff was excellent. Clean facilities from check in counter, to room and bath, breakfast area and laundry room. Location is great for getting to the theme parks. It is located walking distance to many places to eat for when not at the parks. Parking lot was never a hassle to get in and out. Adrian and the rest of the staff offered great and friendly customer service. They were able to accommodate early check in, provided helpful information when asked, and were prompt to respond to requests. Would definitely consider staying here again when needing to visit the nearby theme parks.

CDWAS,29,Louisiana,2021-07-31,FAMILY,2021-07-22,5,Good Stay But Breakfast Could Be Better,"My family and I recently spent 3 nights at this Hampton Inn in Anaheim.  The location is great, the suites are large, and the staff is professional and friendly.  The only negative for us was the breakfast:  bagel, cream cheese, yogurt, boiled eggs, and juice.  Unfortunately, this meal was served every day that we visited, and I seriously considered deducting a star for this reason.  It is my sincere hope that management at this hotel will improve this area.  Families, such as myself, have come to depend on a decent, filling breakfast from the hotel chains that we know and trust and more effort could be focused in this important area.  There are many choices, such as pre-packaged breakfast sandwiches or cereals and milk that could be provided.  It is disappointing to have to go somewhere else due to the poor selection.  As a health care provider, I fully understand the impact of the pandemic.  However, guest families deserve better.",,,,,,,,Brenna Simpson,Guest Services / Front Office,2021-07-27,"Thank you for taking the time to leave a review CDWAS! We are happy to hear that you enjoyed your overall stay with us.  We appreciate your patience as we navigate the grab and go options during COVID-19 and we are hoping to have our breakfast buffet up and running again soon. We hope to see you again on your next trip to Anaheim!

It seems new, everything was clean and in good working order, and we had a comfortable stay.  We faced the front of the hotel (Katella Ave.) but didn't have any problem with noise.  They have modified the included breakfast a bit due to Covid - an employee serves the hot items (so-so scrambled eggs, etc) and you help yourself to juice, whole fruit, and a few other items.  There are hand sanitizer dispensers all around, but rarely had any contents.
It is walking distance to Disney and all the restaurants that surround it; there is also a small strip mall across the intersection that has a Starbucks and several fast casual restaurants. 
Note that there is another Hampton Inn three blocks away, the Hampton Anaheim/Garden Grove, and it's easy to get these confused if you're using Uber (our driver said it happens a lot).",,,3.0,4.0,,,5.0,,,,,369

Angela J,4,,2021-09-30,NONE,2021-09-29,5,Great Stay!,"I recently stayed 4 nights at this newish property.  It was very clean.  I felt safe.  Masks were required in common areas.  They requested only one family unit per elevator.  Keys were required to use the elevator.  They were offering a very limited hot breakfast or cold cereal.  Breakfast consisted of scrambled eggs, a meat and a potato.  An employee served the hot breakfast items, which I appreciated.  They also had bananas, apples and oranges.  

On my first night, I had room 511 in the front corner of the building right by the street corner.  It was very noisy.  I felt like I was sleeping on the street corner.  I requested a different room for the rest of my stay, and they happily moved me to the back side of the building overlooking the pool.  It was much quieter.  

Our stay was to go to Disneyland.  It is walkable if you are so inclined, probably about a mile plus.  We used Uber to get to and from the park.  It was about $7 plus tip one way to the Harbor street drop off spot.

That made up for the noisy street. We were on the top floor in a king studio . The pool area was huge, clean and nearly empty every time we went.  

Breakfast was included but got pretty boring after a few days …. Every day was scrambled eggs , hash browns and sausage . A couple cereals were offered …. No toast or pancake or waffle. 

There were some great restaurants all around the hotel so lots of choice for eating. 

If you are here for Disney the BEST thing about this hotel is how easy it is to get there. The hotel is a 5 minute walk to the buses at the Toy story parking lot. You walk there get on the bus and it takes you right to the Disney entrance - FOR FREE. They don’t ask or care that you have not parked there - we told the attendant on day 1 we were from the hotel - he said it didn’t matter and to hop on! This was a great money saver as you have to pay additional 20$per night to park at the hotel.

However the customer service was ABRUPT RUDE JUDGEMENTAL, MEAN SPIRITED & UNCALLED FOR.
   I have a medical condition that causes me to smell bad. Nothing much I can do about it trust me or I would've already. Nevertheless the two women at the desk on JUNE 18 2021 are vicious and they are also liars. They told me the entire hot was booked for June 18 2021 abd j could not stay another night there but i checked 2 websites after being told they were booked completely that had vacancies one app had 9 rooms left and the other app had 23 rooms left specifically at that property. I showed them my phone proving as much to them. It was of no concern of theirs. Talk about manipulation. 
I WILL NEVER PATRONIZE ANOTHER HILTON PROPERTY EVER AGAIN AND YOU SHOULDNT EITHER. 

Trust me EMBASSY SUITES was happy to have my business. Try them instead of any Hilton property.

Joanne,1,,2020-01-31,FAMILY,2020-02-07,5,We will definitely return!,"We stayed here while visiting Disneyland for 3 days. I received a text message 1-2 days before my check-in date asking if I had any questions or any special
requests to feel free to inform the hotel. I replied back that our visit was to celebrate my son’s 8th birthday. 

We checked in at the front desk and were politely greeted by Brenna and Ivan. Brenna gave us our room key and off we went. The Hotel was very clean and the end results of the renovations done
to the hotel the previous year were nice. 

5-10 minutes after getting into our room a knock came from the door and Brenna pleasantly surprised us bearing a gift. She handed over a goodie basket with snacks, drinks, small toys, candy, Mickey Mouse ears, helium balloons and  a Happy 8th Birthday card addresses to my little guy! My son’s face lit up (as did mine). Thanks for going above and beyond - already setting the tone early for a magical, fantastic trip!  

The rooms were spacious, the complimentary hot breakfast Buffett was always stocked with a good selection of foods. The array of foods consisted of eggs, potatoes, a daily breakfast meat, cereal, waffles, pastries, yogurt, water, fruit, juice, milk, Hot chocolate, tea and coffee. By the way - water, hot chocolate, coffee and tea are available in the lobby 24/7. There was something for everyone and it was nice to eat a meal before heading out for the day, easily saving us a total of 3 meals we would have purchased elsewhere. 

We met other hotel guests who walked a 10-12 minute distance to Disneyland from the hotel but we opted for a $5.xx Uber ride from right outside the hotel lobby. 

We stayed a total of three nights. 1st day Disneyland. Our 2nd day we slept in and later Uber’ed to Downtown Disney to walk around and bowl. We stayed a few hours and headed back to the hotel to enjoy the pool/jacuzzi ... IN JANUARY!!!   The pool wasn’t heated but it wasn’t freezing either - actually perfect. On our last day we went to California Adventure. It was nice taking it easy after a long day/night at Disneyland. We were well rested and were able to start early each day at the parks. I think a great idea when traveling with younger kids. (Ours 5 & 8)

This is our new Go-To hotel for Our future Disney trips. Thank you for a great stay! All of the staff were friendly, helpful and did an exceptional job. Special shout out to Brenna - you made it especially awesome!",,,,,,,,kristihampton,res supervisor,2020-02-08,"Thank you for your very kind review Jojo25sd1!

- Stayed 6 nights, including Xmas and Eve;
- Great Breakfast 06:00 - 10:00, close on dot, though;
- Complimentary Coffee, Hot/Cold Water, Hot Choc and fruits;
- Easy public transport to/from/around Theme Parks, ART No. 2, stop at the hotel building, Optional No.6 (stop at Peacock Suites, 2 min. walk to Hampton); Both bus run in loop routes so passengers do not have to cross any street. Day Pass or Multi Day Pass works the best;
- Very friendly and helpful staff, everyone has a smile face, literally everyone...;
- Best of all, the room is noise proof, as ours is facing West Katella Ave. quite heavy traffic, 3 lanes on each direction. The hotel building is right at the corner of W Katella and Haster St. but hardly heard any. We planned to do Magic Morning as entitled one entry. But never made it happen because we always over slept...;
- Our room is spotlessly clean, by the way, this hotel is shining like a new penny. At certain place/s of the building we can still smell the paint...;
- One feature of our room that impressed us the most is the bathroom light and bedside lights are automatic. So you don't have to look for switches... so convenient; 
- Cross the corner from the hotel, there are multiple restaurants, we had our best burger in Habit Burger and fish + chips in another....;
All of the above have made our 6 day Disneyland trip the greatest success. Will definitely try to stay here again when coming next time...

Gordon655,69,,2019-12-31,NONE,2019-12-28,4,Nice Base for Disneyland Vacation!,"My family of 4 stayed at this hotel for 3 nights during our recent Disneyland vacation.  The primary selling points in selecting this hotel were its newness, its complimentary full breakfast, and proximity to Disneyland (1 mile/20 minute walk).  Overall, we were satisfied with our stay, and will definitely stay here again.  Here are some more details:

Pros:
-Hotel was large, clean and modern.  Parking was adequate and secure (parking fee = $20/day)
-Bedding and linens were comfortable, clean and fresh.
-Large breakfast serving and seating areas (pro).  However, seating was still at a premium most mornings, but especially on Sunday morning, when it got slammed and servers had a hard time keeping food replenished (con).
-Lots of restaurants located right across street from the hotel.  We ate at Fish Grill, Habit Burger and PF Chang's.  It is located directly across street from Anaheim GardenWalk.
-We walked to Disneyland each day.  It was a bit of a hike, especially at the end of the day, but was manageable.
-We were able to buy our Disneyland tickets at the front desk.
-All of the hotel employees we interacted with were courteous and friendly.

Cons:  
-We had a room on the 5th floor facing Katella,, odd-numbered room.  Although the windows were well-insulated, you could still hear traffic noise (ie, loud buses, motorcycles, etc).  I would recommend an even-numbered room to minimize traffic noise.  This is the primary reason I only gave it four stars vs. five.

Outgunned3to1,114,"Bakersfield, California",2019-12-31,FAMILY,2019-12-15,2,Don't Bother if Sleep is Important,"Nice looking building (especially for a mid-grade motel) and everything is very clean.  Location is adequate if visiting the parks (albeit too long to walk with small children).  However, whatever you do, demand a room on the ""quiet"" side of the hotel.  I would not have thought that as a Hilton Honors member, who had paid for an upgraded room, that I would have to request a ""quiet"" room.  The street side rooms are a joke and the floor to ceiling windows provide absolutely no soundproofing.  My wife and I got no sleep for two nights.  Unfortunately by the time we realized we were sleeping on top of a raceway, the kids were asleep and we were totally unpacked.  Didn't have time in the morning to repack and move rooms as we wanted to get the kids to Disneyland asap.  Was too late to do it/kids asleep again when we got back that night.  I'm sure they would have moved us if we had wanted to go through the hassle, but in my mind, they shouldn't put anyone in those rooms in the first place.   While I assume the other side of the hotel is much more quiet, I'm angry enough for just being put in that room (323) that I will never go back.

Excellent check-in. Friendly, helpful, professional crew working the desk. Nice breakfast and day area. Clean and very up-to-date rooms. Comfortable beds and restroom. For the room facing Katella Avenue, it is reasonably quiet except for very loud vehicles passing by. Feels like a newer facility because it is - just over a year old at the time of this review. Cost effective stay if visiting Disneyland, but it is about a one mile walk to the Disneyland entry, thus close but not *that* close.

The hotel staff - especially Gorman - were amazing!! Professional but also let their natural personalities come out. We couldn't check in early but they stored our belongings for us so that we could get to the parks for the day. The lobby looked brand spanking new and it was decorated really pretty. Plenty of places to sit and chill outside of your room. Also the chocolate chip cookies helped the welcoming environment! :-) The rooms were very nice and it includes a safe in the closet as well. Breakfast was very good and the staff kept the area very stocked and clean during serving. The neighborhood around it on Katella is being built up with new business. We walked across the street for burgers at The Habit. There is also a 7-11 across the street for convenience.

37rachaelr,9,,2019-11-30,FAMILY,2019-11-30,4,"Clean New Hotel, but impersonal staff.","Loved the size of the room. My father, my two teens, a tween and myself easily enjoyed the room and space of our room. The pull out was very comfy (esp for a pull out!). 

Pool and hot tub were amazing!!!!! Especially after walking all day at Disney. I only wished it stayed open later (it closes at 10pm).

Breakfast was just okay. They have what is needed, just kind of redundant. Oatmeal, waffles, eggs, potatoes, sometime of ham and sausage and fruit. So has all the variety, flavor was just standard. No real complaints, just nothing really standing out, your basic Hampton fair. 

Distance to Disney is what ultimately will be the deciding factor in staying here again. It’s just too far. We all are in good shape, but it’s just too far to be going back and forth. They do offer a shuttle, but once you factor in the price of paid parking and then the price of a shuttle for a large family, it is more cost effective to stay closer to the park itself or stay close to Toy Story parking. It was about a 15 min walk to Toy Story parking and 22 min walk to Disneyland. So not overly far, just not convenient.

burlathan,1,"San Diego, California",2019-11-30,COUPLES,2019-11-07,4,Good room at a good price,The hotel is very nice and very clean. The rooms are great aside from the mattress and sheet quality not being the best. The complementary breakfast is pretty good too. If you plan on going to Disneyland you have to Uber/Lyft there since there is no shuttle service to Disney. Parking at the hotel is an additional $20 bucks a day which kinda sucks.,,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,kristihampton,res supervisor,2019-11-11,"Thank you for your feedback burlathan! We appreciate you staying at our new hotel, and hope you enjoyed your time with us.

Hopefully this will make your trip easier!

Chris P,15,"Mount Prospect, Illinois",2019-10-31,NONE,2019-10-31,3,Disneyland Vacation,"Stayed at this hotel that past week for 4 nights, 5 days. Overall the hotel was nice and had a good stay. We went to Disney every day during our stay. Walking from the hotel to the park took 20 - 25 minutes. The walk was not bad and is doable (if you are up for it). At night the further you get from the parks the eerier it got. Not so much I felt unsafe just that had to be cautious. There was some homeless, and interesting people out let's just say that. Uber/lyft cost about $6-7 depending what time you take one (could be less during times that arent busy such as after park opens and before park close). We preferred taking a lyft after the 2nd day vs walking. We were at the park ALL day so cutting off the extra 20-minute walk to the park was worth the price of the lyft. We consider taking the ART bus but having to wait for the bus to come and make a few stops before reaching Disney we rather just pay for the lyft when we want it with no stops by ourselves. The hotel itself was nicely updated as it is less than one-year-old. The people at the front desk were nice and helpful. They were able to store our bags on the last day so we could enjoy the park before heading to the airport. It was nice knowing that you had to use your keycard to access the elevator at night and the side entrances. We stayed in a king room with bunk beds and a couch. The room was spacious. We were on the 3rd floor on the ""side"" of the hotel. Couldn't hear much of any street noise but, could hear our noisy neighbor above us.  The bed was FIRM which we didn't really like but after walking for 10 hours it felt fine. Seemed a bit odd there was only one sink vs two considering the room could technically accommodate 6 people. The shower was average tub/shower combo. Bring your own shampoo/soap. The hand soap made our hands super dry. The brand of the soap was Neutrogrena which I was surprised how bad it was. The room had a mini-fridge and wifi. The complimentary breakfast in the morning was average at best. It was free so can't complain too much. We came down around 8 am each morning and there were sometimes when things were already out. We did not have time to check out the pool located on the 2nd floor but it looked nice. Overall the hotel served its purpose as a place to sleep. This was our first trip to Disneyland. I would recommend staying closer to the parks if you plan on only walking. It may be more expensive but if you want to stay directly across the street or at least a walk about 5 -10 min. would be more appropriate.",,3.0,3.0,,3.0,,,John-HiltonHelp,on behalf of management,2019-11-04,"Dear Chris P,

Sprout211,757,"Chesapeake, Virginia",2019-10-31,FRIENDS,2019-10-30,5,Great Choice for Disney Vacation ,"Stayed here from October 23-27.  My cousin stayed with me 4 nights and a friend stayed with me the last night.  I went to Disney everyday (6 days in a row... I’m tired) using the shuttle service.  Shuttle service is the ART Bus and this hotel is the first pick up so it’s great to have your choice of seat and the first to be dropped off when you leave the parks.  HUGE benefit! Shuttle price is $6 for round trip daily.
Property is very clean.  Mike at front desk was so polite.  Great customer service.  I was able to check in at 12.  Breakfast is included and was good.  I didn’t use the pool but had a view of it from my room and it looked nice.  There were several restaurants within walking distance for those that may want to try some place away from Disney.  This property is about .5 miles  from the park.
I will happily stay here again.",,,,,,,,kristihampton,res supervisor,2019-10-30,"Thank you for your great review on our hotel Sprout211!

catherinerain,63,"Atlanta, Georgia",2019-10-31,NONE,2019-10-19,5,Great stay in Anaheim (Disneyland),"We just returned from a great stay at this location!

Pros:
The breakfast is the best breakfast I have ever had at a hotel. Huge selection that changed everyday. We had breakfast four mornings at the hotel and the different selections each morning were very appreciated. The breakfast area is huge and always had plenty of seating no matter what time we went down. The hot coffee was also very appreciated! 

The staff was excellent. Everyone we encountered was very kind and professional. We were celebrating two birthdays, and Taylor created a very sweet and nice birthday basket for us. So sweet!

The room was spotless. Most clean room I've ever stayed in. Our housekeeping service each day was timely. It was very much appreciated coming back to a sparkling clean room every night. 

The location is a pro in that it was near fast food options and not too far from the Disneyland gates. Uber/ Lyft was around $6 one way to the parks (see more of that in the cons below). The hotel itself was also pretty quiet. We rarely heard noise from our neighbors or outside. 

The wifi was amazing. Best hotel wifi I've ever used.

Cons: 
The room had very little space to store clothing. The room was spacious, but only had three tiny wire drawers. We made due with the closet and used our suitcases, but the room desperately needed more drawers. In one area, they had two large cube seats that were unnecessary. I highly suggest adding storage at that location. 

The location was .9 miles from Disneyland property and 1.2 miles to the actual gate. With crosswalks, it took us (two 20 years olds) around 25 minutes each way. This is not a bad walk at all, but was farther than we had hoped. We typically ended our daily adventures around 12am, and walking back around that time was not the safest. We never felt at danger in the area, but it was certainly ""sketchy"" (someone was arrested in front of us, I kid you not). You can always Uber/Lyft as it was not expensive, however. 

Needless to say, the ""cons"" should not discourage you from staying here for a Disneyland vacation. We will definitely consider staying here again.",,,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,kristihampton,res supervisor,2019-10-22,"Wow! Thank you for your very kind words catherinerain!

Honest Hotel Reviews,107,"Anaheim, California",2019-06-30,NONE,2019-10-07,4,It is Possible to have a Sophisticated Stay near Disneyland. HUGE STAFF SHOUT-OUT,"As one of those childless, mid 30s Disney fanatic chicks, trust me when I say it IS possible to have a relaxing stay at a Disneyland Good Neighbor Hotel. As one of the newer hotels on the Disneyland Resort scene that boasts a free breakfast and great pool area, The Hampton Inn & Suites looked like a great pick for me to check out.

First off, the staff here are some of the most genuinely friendly hotel staff I've ever met. HUGE KUDOS. The lobby/main floor was great & had tons of space for people to hang out. The complimentary coffee & tea was great (especially since starbucks is a good 8-10 minute walk away). Also, Disneyland is over a 20 minute walk away, but an uber only cost about $5-7 each way....WORTH IT!

The room was really small, but the super high ceilings and great layout made it feel bigger than usual. If you like a soft mattress, like me, you'll be disappointed. It was hard as a rock!!!! but thankfully the pillows were soft, but I still woke up several times a night because my back was cramping. The in-room amenities included a fridge, microwave, safe, iron, ironing board, luggage holder, full sized hair dryer, flat screen tv.

The pool is fantastic! I love a good pool area and this one doesn't disappoint. Tons of chairs, loungers & towels...but could use a few more umbrellas.

The breakfast buffet was underwhelming...the hot items seemed to be the frozen then reheated stuff and the fruit was, meh...that said, they had tons of cereals, great coffee and a waffle station. 

At the end of the day, I highly recommend this place to people who like a firm bed and who are looking for a more adult-minded place to stay (they do cater to kids though!). If you do have kids, you'll probably want to book one of their larger rooms. I wouldn't stay here again, ONLY because of the beds.",,,5.0,2.0,,3.0,,kristihampton,res supervisor,2019-10-17,"Thank you for your very honest feedback honesthotelreview!

I am a Hilton Honors Gold member and at check-in we were upgraded and I received my complimentary Gold gifts and the front desk staff were super friendly. 
Our arrival was very early at 8am but they allowed us to have our room so our kids could sleep (arrived from Australia so kids were really tired)
The room was extremely large, had bunk beds and the crib we asked for was delivered and set up in a speedy manner by housekeeping.
The bathroom was spacious and we appreciated the free breakfast which was really amazing, waffles, omelettes, cereal, toast, fruit and so much more. Really made our mornings easy before heading to the parks.
What really made this place special is the staff, when it was time to check-out our pre-arranged transport never arrived and it was 6am and we had two small children and a flight out of LAX to catch. The Gentleman at the front desk called Asmara Transport for us which is a company they use and he was there in 10mins and took us to the airport. I was really stressed out but they helped so much.
Took about 20mins to walk to the parks and it was an easy walk.

deee388,1,"San Jose, California",2019-09-30,COUPLES,2019-09-19,5,Great Hotel and New!,Pretty much a newly built hotel! Modern! My hotel stay began before my arrival. The previous night I have called to see if there is any possible way I could get an early check in. The front desk representative named Ivan was very understanding and accommodating. He was able to give us early check in for the day of arrival. The room given to us was a pretty clean room except for some hair that were found randomly. The only things that I could be picky about was the noise from the road and the air conditioner. It didn’t bother us too much so we just let it slide. The stay was great overall with excellent Customer Service from Ivan and Antonio that assisted us with late checkout. If you are going to Disneyland it is a good hotel to stay at! The shuttle bus stop is right in back of the hotel. Also it is the very first stop coming back from Disney. I would definitely recommend to stay here. The price is fair and not too expensive compared to other hotels around the area. Breakfast was included as well! Thanks again to the staff there for a wonderful stay.,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,kristihampton,res supervisor,2019-09-30,"Thank you for your great feedback deee388!

LBNWSNC,34,"Winston Salem, North Carolina",2019-08-31,FRIENDS,2019-09-01,5,New hotel!  Great location!,Stayed at this property for the last four nights. The property has only been open a few months. Front desk staff were excellent. Very helpful. Complimentary breakfast was good each day. Attendants ensured area stayed clean and well stocked. We were upgraded to a suite which I appreciated but the room had no nightstand drawers. There was one “bin” on the opposite side of the room with three pull out wire baskets. The “suite” part was an open area with a sofa and two ottomans. A lot of open space. The wastebasket in the bathroom area was directly under an overhead shelf. For the first two days I hit my head pretty hard until I finally moved the basket to the other side of the vanity. Housekeeping was ok. Left cleaning supplies I our room one day and didn’t do much but make the beds and change out towels the next day. Very close to Disneyland. No complimentary shuttle but it is an easy walk. Would definitely recommend for the budget-conscious. ,,,,,,,,kristihampton,res supervisor,2019-09-02,"Thank you for your great review LBNWSNC!

We chose this hotel because it was reasonably priced and close to Disneyland.  It's a bit of a walk to the Disney gates from the hotel.  But it is walkable. We took a Lyft to the gates a couple of times to save time, and that was very inexpensive. The hotel has a complimentary breakfast, with a wide variety of items.  The staff running the breakfast kept the food items well-stocked and were extremely friendly and service-oriented.  The hotel was very clean and well-kept.  It was also very quiet.  There is onsite parking for a fee, but you are able to go in and out as desired with your room key.  Our last day at the hotel, we were able to leave our luggage with the front desk and our car in the parking lot until the evening, which allowed us to visit Disney for a second day without the hassle of parking and leaving our luggage in the car all day.

Adrian Sim,90,"Preston, United Kingdom",2019-08-31,FAMILY,2019-08-24,5,"New, comfortable, excellent for families visiting Disney","After arriving in Anaheim for 3 nights at the end of our first US family road trip, we originally booked into the main Hilton property at the convention centre which turned out to be a major mistake. After a night of disturbed sleep I checked availability at other Hilton properties and the Hampton had a twin room available. After complaining to the management at the first property we checked out after breakfast and got an Uber to the Hampton.
We arrived before 9am as it was going to be our first day in Disney, expecting to throw our bags with the porter and head out, but instead we got an incredibly friendly welcome, someone who understood out issue and he gave us the room keys immediately so we could drop our bags.
The following 2 nights were amazing, stress free breakfasts, clean and immaculate rooms, great pool for the children and wonderful staff.
Throughout the stay Jamelle was wonderful even giving me complimentary beer from the lock up as there were none chilled in the fridge.
Honestly, as I always perceived the Hampton brand to be a lower quality brand in the hilton chain, as an hhonors gold member I hadn't selected them but what a mistake, this was incredible value for money. The more premium brands in the Hilton portfolio could learn an awful lot from the Hampton brand, they really understand customer service and brand loyalty.",,,,,,,,kristihampton,res supervisor,2019-08-27,"Wow!

Room: We had ANTS in the room, and so as others as well. I guess rooms are not very well maintained like the outside and other facilities in the hotel. 
We had ANTS in the room, Faucet Leaking, bathroom door lock Jamming, French door rail is broken, which I didn't care about any of these except the ANTs problems. The staff were very helpful came and sprayed the room 3 times (3 times, There is a big ANT problem in the room) - hopefully they will fix it.

DrVille,80,"Pewee Valley, Kentucky",2019-07-31,FAMILY,2019-08-11,5,Great place for Disney stay!,"This is a great hotel for Disneyland trip. 
Property is like new with rooms and common areas in great condition. 
The front desk was really nice and gave us tips for the parks. 
Free breakfast was good with eggs, a meat and lots of baked goods, and the staff was great at keeping things stocked and clean. The large area for breakfast also made it feel comfortable and relaxing.  
The location was really good. Parking was $20 but it was well worth it because we really didn’t need our car. Disney is about a 15 minute walk to the front gate (take a shortcut through the Gardenwalk mall to get to Disney Drive).  You can access both parks and Downtown Disney from the front gate. 
They said you can take an Uber to go back to the hotel at the end of the day, but we really did not find it necessary (what’s 15 more minutes after walking all day in the parks?). 
This would also be a good location for the Convention Center or any of the sports games. 
Tip: The Queen Suite rooms are huge and you can really spread out.",,,,,,,,kristihampton,res supervisor,2019-08-12,"Thank you for your review DrVille!

napiboi808,1,"West Jordan, Utah",2019-08-31,FAMILY,2019-08-09,5,Wonderful customer service matches beautiful hotel!!,Most of the time I dread hotel check in. My experience at the hotel always depends on my check in process. I got in super late and I wasn’t quite sure how the evening check in person was going to greet me. The customer service that was given to me by Tony is what you call “going above & beyond”. Thank you for not making this check in another horrific check in to add to my book. Hotels need more front desk people like Tony. Not only was this hotel nice but the service provided matched how beautiful this hotel is. I am not sure if Tony will read this but I just want to say “Thank you for giving such great service.” ,,,,,,,,kristihampton,res supervisor,2019-08-12,"Wow! Thank you so much napiboi808!

He greeted us with a smile and made checking in a breeze. He told us of the amenities the hotel had to offer and answered all our questions we had regarding the area. Tony started off our trip with such great energy that I knew the rest of our trip would turn out great. The hotel is absolutely beautiful. Our room was super clean.

Rooms were nice but we had a problem with several ants in our bathroom on the night of out arrival. I walked in to find one crawling on my electric toothbrush head. I called the front desk and the Diamond call line to ensure that we could switch rooms, but the hotel was entirely booked for the night. Was a really disorganized process to switch rooms the following day, and staff weren’t aware of the situation, nor did anyone go out of their way to help us. We had to return from Disneyland to pack up and move our stuff. Not anyone’s fault in the staff, but just an unpleasant experience. We may go for the Hyatt closer to Disneyland in the future.

FREDLOW1,48,"Downey, California",2019-08-31,FAMILY,2019-08-03,5,2nd Stay still great,"We liked our first stay so decided to come back. We actually live 20 minutes away but like to get away here and there and this will be one of our new spots. Not a bad place to stay if going to Disneyland.
At check in front desk again nice however this time around Antonio or Anthony, I dont recall, was able to give us an upgrade. Not sure if it was because I am a Gold HH but it was appreciated. Very nice room big and clean. Room was on the third floor but we were still able to see the fireworks from our room. The complaint here is the same as my last stay which is the noise from the street. Since I was upgraded I was not going to ask for a different room. Next time I will ask for a room that does not face Katella.
This time around breakfast was better. Came down around 9 am and it was busy but they did a good job of keeping the food stocked. I was impressed by one of the staff members, Rocky, who was killing it. He was all over the place from checking in on the food in the back to clearing off tables, taking plates and answering questions. And he did all this with a smile.
Keep in mind this is a Disney Resort area property and it will be busy with kids and teenagers. Also, they do charge for parking as all area hotels do.",Ask for a room that does NOT face Katella due to noise.

The AC was a tad bit noisy. There are ample places to charge your devices and the beds were comfortable. The free breakfast was outstanding for a Hampton Inn - it was along the lines of an Embassy Suites breakfast. Parking was easy. The only downfall of this hotel is the location. We ubered to the park for $6 each way. Uber drivers have no idea how to get in the parking lot. You need to message them and tell them to come
Into the parking lot and the ticket will provide a 30 minute grace period. It would be a lengthy walk and we had already walked 10 miles a day. If you are driving, it wouldn’t be an issue. It’s a great new hotel.

The staff is friendly and helpful in suggesting things to do in the area.  We stayed two days, before checking out and heading to San Diego. Our hotel in San Diego was horrible, so we drove all the way back and stayed two more nights at the Hampton because we knew the hotel was great. 

As far as a Disney stay, it would be awesome if they had a shuttle. It is not really walking distance to the park. We had to drive to the park. However, I realize their customers stay for many different reasons. There are tons great places to eat right around the hotel. The hotel breakfast is one of the best you can get. I would highly recommend this hotel.","Ask for a room with two beds and a sofa sleeper, they are HUGE!",5.0,5.0,,,5.0,,kristihampton,res supervisor,2019-07-08,"Thanks for staying with us cathyg20092009!

Wbracco,73,"Brooklyn, New York",2019-06-30,COUPLES,2019-06-22,5,"Comfortable, Clean, Courteous","Hubby and I stayed here for one night to visit Disneyland.   I was very happy with the new hotel. It was very clean and the beds were extremely comfortable.   I love the bright white bedding which made me feel that the room was sterile and clean.  The laminate floors were a plus since I'm always wary of rugs and carpets and wear flip flops so my bare feet never touch the rugs.  
The TV was new and huge.  The cable service provider Spectrum was slow and lagged when changing channels so that was annoying.  I don't believe that is the fault of hotel but they should be aware. 
The breakfast was good and fresh.  Scrambled eggs,  chorizo, waffles and your typical continent choices were fresh and fully stocked.  The hostess at the breakfast station was on point with refilling the stations.   It was crowded during breakfast and we spoke to a couple of traveling families as well.  The environment was friendly and warm.  
The evening that we checked in we asked for dinner recommendations and were given good advice. We walked across the street to the garden center where there were several known restaurants to choose from: cheesecake factory, McCormick and Schmitt,  Johnny rockets and house of blues.  We decided on Johnny Rockets and were pleasantly surprise as it was our first time eating there! Please don't judge lol.  

I would definitely stay here again.",,,,,,,,kristihampton,res supervisor,2019-06-24,"Thank you for your great review Wbracco!

SQF808,20,"Honolulu, Hawaii",2019-06-30,BUSINESS,2019-06-09,4,"Nice, new and complimentary breakfast","Recently attended a conference in Anaheim and chose this lovely hotel.  While it is limited service, this hotel is nearly brand new.  Rooms are tastefully designed and spacious.  The complimentary breakfast is a plus, good variety of breakfast foods, including fresh fruit. The location is also also a quick drive to the Anaheim convention center or about a 15-20 minute walk, so very accessible.  Also a good location to Disney park.  

I would have rated this hotel a 5, however, upon arrival, we were greeted by a less then enthusiastic guest service agent.  We arrived early after a red-eye, and while we understand that early check-in is based on availability, she was less then helpful in at least trying to pretend to do her best to assist.  I had to ask to pre-register, it was not offered.  I also had to ask if she wanted my phone number to contact us when a room might be ready.  Maybe it was early in the morning and she had not yet gotten into the work mode, but the attitude was somewhat disappointing.

The breakfast is clean and has quite a selection to choose from.  My only suggestion is that they need to have more staff to help out during the rush hours. I was very pleased with the clean, quiet, comfortable room we had during our stay.   However I was NOT happy about the housekeeping staff coming into our room when I was in the bathroom with the door open.  I heard a knock on the door, but I thought it was my husband coming back into the room and maybe his key didn't work or something.  But soon after the knock, the door opened and the housekeeper walked in the room WITHOUT announcing, ""Housekeeping"".  I said, ""Excuse me"", she heard and saw me, and quickly turned and went out of the room.  A little embarrassing but, oh well, what can you do.

It is a nice, modern contemporary design like so many of the newer Hampton Inns. The front desk staff was very friendly. The room was modern and impeccably clean. Breakfast was way above the average for a Hampton Inn, with several hot selections and plenty of waffle makers! This hotel would be a great place for a family. Parking is an additional $20.00. About a 25 minute walk to Disneyland's main gate and Downtown Disney.

R Shindler,3,,2019-05-31,FAMILY,2019-05-15,5,Quality service at a quality establishment,"We took our daughter and her grandmother to Disneyland for her birthday and wanted to stay overnight beforehand to get a jump on our Disney day without having to drive. We arrived late the evening before, and my daughter was already asleep on the drive; the staff was very helpful to get us checked in speedily and quietly so we could whisk her upstairs and put her to bed. 

The room was comfortable and spacious enough that we could put her down and still unload and unpack ourselves without disturbing her. The pillows were a bit overly large for my comfort, but I didn't want to disturb my daughter's sleep to call for different ones (I later confirmed I could have done so). 

The pool and hot tub were spacious and comfortable. I especially appreciated the large hot tub, given how small some are in the area and how many people generally frequent them during busy times. 

We were able to get up early and quickly pack up. The breakfast was DELICIOUS, even with our variety of preferences (including a celiac sufferer). I'm a huge waffle fan, and they didn't disappoint. My wife loved their custom breakfast bagel bites (think bagel pizza, but with eggs, sausage, and cheese melted on top instead of sauce and pepperoni), and my MIL appreciated the variety of fruit options. 

On top of it all, the hotel was easily close enough to walk to the park, even while pushing my daughter in her stroller. We checked out, loaded up the car, and walked to Disneyland for the day, then came back and picked up the car after dinner to start the long drive home. No issues at all with parking, they were happy to let us keep the car there for the day while we went to play. 

While I would remember to ask to change out the pillows next time, I will definitely be coming back to this hotel next time we are headed to the parks!",,,5.0,4.0,,,,kristihampton,res supervisor,2019-05-16,"Wow!

CMCPhoenix,14,,2019-05-31,NONE,2019-05-14,5,Team Dedication to Exceptional Service,"This team collectively is outstanding.  Where other hotels may have a single standout, this management team has assembled an entire group of exemplary employees. They are intelligent, knowledgeable, personable and accommodating.  Why do you care when you just want to know about the hotel?  Because this team  drives the  seamless experience you will have when staying here.  If I am being completely honest, my only reservation in sharing our feedback is that this gem will be unearthed by so many that we will have difficulty procuring future reservations or price ourselves out of the market.  However, this hotel deserves to be recognized for its outstanding performance.  

Check-in:  Patient -  I had cc difficulty , HHonors check-in goodies, accommodating with location , sincerely pleasant  

Room:  Extremely clean, contemporary and comfortable,  large windows w blackout coverings, multiple mirrors, fridge + microwave, comfortable mattress/ bedding

Pool:  Lovely setting,convenient restrooms, outdoor shower, nice seating, 

Breakfast: nice selection/variety,  grab n go bags later 

Location:  Excellent, directly across from Garden Walk so restaurant options beyond Disney (Cheesecake Factory etc), walkable to Disney, a 10-15 min walk  

Other: this is an urban hotel so, yes, there will be some urban noise 

OVERALL:  This is a new Hampton Inn with a clean, contemporary aesthetic.  Excellent value for Disney area. The team elevates this hotel from a standard value property to a lovely, high end service hotel.

From Janelle checking us in, Abby, Gorman and Tony at reception, the super friendly and helpful 5th floor housekeeping staff, Antonio in maintenance and Megan at breakfast, you all helped provide one of the best hotel experiences ever! 

An excellent location, within walking distance to pretty much anything you'd need, including Disney. Breakfast was delicious with many options, staff kept on top of restocking, coffee was surprisingly tasty. Our room with a king bed, bunk beds and a pullout couch was super comfortable and a great view including the Disney fireworks. 

I loved spending time in the jacuzzi and warming up in the sun.  There were plenty of towels & pool staff were very friendly.

BahaMeli,11,,2019-05-31,FAMILY,2019-05-13,5,Great Location/Great Rooms/Great Staff - All Great,"Went to this hotel for a few days in May. Chose this hotel because it was new, and very close to Disneyland.  Checked in and received great service from Brenna.  

The room was nice and clean.  Bathroom was very clean as well. The only thing missing from the room was a dresser to put clothes in.  As we were not staying very long - 2 nights, it didn't matter that much. But if you are staying longer, then a dresser with drawers may be preferred.  Room also had a safe.  

Parking is $ 20 per day plus tax.  Can't get pass the parking rates in this area at all!!! 

Bought Disneyland tickets from the hotel as well. No discount rate as we checked online and they were the same price, which is fine.  Beats buying a ticket at the park and standing on the long lines.

Overall this place gets a 5/5 for me.  I hope the hotel is maintained properly and the staff keeps up the professional and great service.  Didn't mention the free breakfast as we didn't eat as we got up too late!   

Pool is on the 2nd floor same as laundry and gym.  Everything you need is right there!

She let us know about the Anaheim Packing place where they have a lot of nice small restaurants which my kids enjoyed . The rooms were very clean and place looked new so the establishment was great overall. The downside was that there is so many people staying here the breakfast staff didn’t seem like they could handle keeping up with the demand . They kept running out of juices and food . It was a bit disappointing after starting off so great . Word of advice : on weekends have breakfast early or there will not be enough food.,,,,,,,,,,,,7

Malia,1,,2019-04-30,FAMILY,2019-04-24,5,Great staycation,Great place for a staycation. I’m an Anaheim resident and my daughter recently passed her test to qualify for the GATE class & as a reward I decided to surprise her with a nice staycation for two days here at the Hampton Inn Anaheim Resort Convention Center. It was last minute but I saw that this was a brand new hotel & perfect for children of all ages. The rooms are both spacious and clean which is at the top of our list when staying at hotels. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. Tony in particular left a huge impression on us. As we checked in I let him know that this was a last minute surprise for my daughter & he had a little gift bag of goodies & toys sent up to our room for her to congratulate her for this great accomplishment. He made my daughters night which as a parent made my night. This small act of kindness is the reason I’ll be staying here every time I decide on a staycation getaway. Thank you Tony for making this an even more memorable experience for us. ,,,,,,,,kristihampton,res supervisor,2019-04-25,"Wow, thank you so much 170veni!

FREDLOW1,48,"Downey, California",2019-04-30,FAMILY,2019-04-24,5,4.5 Stars,"Not 100 percent happy but damn close. I agree with what most people friendly staff clean property and all that, I mean its a new property. Our room was smaller than expected and breakfast could have been better but that is just nitpicking. Also, despite being on the 5th floor, we can still hear the traffic and sirens on Katella. I would get a room that does not face the street. Ill stick to what I liked add a suggestion and some tips.

Pool was clean and there was plenty of towels. There is an overhang that is shaded that provides a perfect place for lunch. There are bathrooms and a shower in the pool area as well.

Like most hotels in the area they charge for parking. It would be nice if they had a shuttle to Disneyland being how close they. It is a short walk but after walking and standing at the park it is a lot. If you do drive to the park, the Toy Story lot is just 4 right turns to get to. You can see it from the pool behind the Disney employee parking.

There are plenty of places across the street at the Anaheim Garden Walk to grab some food.

If you are visiting Disneyland, especially during the hot crowded summer, I suggest getting there for the rope drop (when it opens) and retreating back to the hotel for some pool time and then heading back in the evening. You will avoid the biggest crowds and the heat as well as keeping your sanity",Get a room away from the street.,,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,kristihampton,res supervisor,2019-04-25,"Thank you for your honest feedback FREDLOW1!

jillatin,67,"Westfield, New Jersey",2019-04-30,FAMILY,2019-04-20,5,Great choice in Anaheim,"The property is relatively new and immaculate, and a perfect choice for the price. The staff went above and beyond to make us feel comfortable, and were always friendly. Our family of 4 stayed in a studio suite, which was spacious and comfortable. Breakfast was busy, but everything was replenished quickly, and there were more food choices than we've seen at similar hotels. The staff gave great advice for visiting Disneyland, and offered suggestions for an Angels game. The outdoor pool and hot tub were great.

Disneyland is about a 20-minute walk (be sure to cut through the outdoor mall to shave off a few minutes!), or a quick Uber ride, about $6-7. Parking at Disneyland is $25 and you need to take a tram, so definitely leave your car at the hotel!",,,5.0,,4.0,5.0,,kristihampton,res supervisor,2019-04-21,"Thank you for the kind words jillatin!

Edison1,163,"Makati, Philippines",2019-04-30,FAMILY,2019-04-18,5,Supersize it! ,"We’ve stayed in many Hampton Inns during our trips to the U.S.  yes I can already tell if the Hampton Inn we are staying in is an old property under the one ld “homey” design language as opposed to the newer properties that are very modern.  The one on 100 W. Katella Ave in Anaheim just opened the past few months and it is unabashedly modern.  

Everything about this Hampton Inn & Suites is supersized, from the lobby, to the dining area, to the rooms. I cannot stress how good it is to be able to stretch out in the room and not have to climb over multiple large luggages.  Even the bathrooms are huge.

As for the staff, they were extremely kind, helpful and friendly, especially Tony.  He made our stay extra special, which really mattered after staying in 10 hotels over the past 2 weeks, including at least 2 other Hampton Inn and Suites for this trip through Arizona, Utah, Colorado, New Mexico and California. At the end of the day, you realize that it’s the service that really matters.

We booked a slightly larger room as there was myself, husband and teenage daughter, the room was great with two double beds, nice size desk and sofa(sofa bed?). Our room also had a microwave, fridge and coffee maker.

We ate breakfast most days at the hotel but requested a to go breakfast one day which was also very good.

Staff at the hotel were nice and always had a smile and a hello when anyone entered reception.

We found the 20-25 minute walk to Disney tough as we were not used to the Anaheim heat but we knew it was worth the walk when booking this hotel. Anaheim garden walk was good for meals and cvs and Walgreens on the way to Disneyland good for snacks and drinks. 

I would happily return ",,,,,,,,kristihampton,res supervisor,2019-04-19,"We appreciate the very generous feedback 444louises!

Front desk personnel were kinds, helpful and  always smiling. They greeted you every time you passed them, asked if you needed anything. We asked for dining  ideas and were always  helpful.
Actually everyone from the front desk to the breakfast room and maids were a special bunch.  

The rooms are spacious and clean, beds are comfy and even the pillows were nice.  They even give you an option to forgo cleaning and laundry to cut down on water usage.

They have a place for just relaxing outside and a wonderful pool and hot tub.
The breakfast was good and a really nice selection. Omelettes, bacon, sausage, fruit, yogurt, cold cereal, oatmeal and beagles. Coffee all day

They have a bus,that picks you up next door to take you to Disneyland and back. Cost is $7.00 per day for adults and $4.00 for children under 10. Drops you off right at front door of hotel. Parking at the Disneyland bus is now $25.00 per car, so quite a savings and more convenient. We highly recommend taking the bus from hotel.
Lots of restaurants within walking distance, also clos to Target and a Big 5

The hotel is very new with modern furniture and fixtures. 

The hotel offered a ton of the usual Hampton Inn amenities, but the best part was the full hot breakfast. They really went above and beyond, including omelettes, scrambled eggs, bacon, ham, cereals, bagels, muffins, etc. The area was well designed with plenty of seating so large families were easily accommodated in the space. 

The hotel is a 15-20 minute walk from the parks, but shuttle services were available and it was located close by to the nearby Garden Walk shops and restaurants.

WESV20,1,"Louisville, Kentucky",2019-04-30,BUSINESS,2019-04-10,5,Excellent destination both business and fun,Newly renovated hotel is perfectly situation near Disneyland for the families and near HWY 5 for the business travelers. The place is one of the nicest Hampton Inn's I've visited over the years and the staff here was above exceptional. Thank you Gorman and Kathy for all the hospitality throughout my 5 day trip. It made my day walking into the hotel and seeing these two everyday.,Ask for a higher floor as the street traffic can be louder at times,,5.0,,5.0,,5.0,kristihampton,res supervisor,2019-04-11,"Thank you WESV20!

LNSD9,4,,2019-04-30,FAMILY,2019-04-10,5,Love this Hotel!!!,"Absolutely wonderful staff and immaculate hotel. This is our second stay for my family of five in 2 months. I travel a lot for work and I can honestly say that this hotel has the *best* staff and the *cleanest* rooms. We were exhausted and a little grumpy when we arrived from our long drive but the staff turned all of our attitudes around with their warm smiles and welcoming demeanors. 

My kids (all under 8 yrs) loved the bunk bedroom. Extra plus that you can close off the bunk bedroom from the main king bedroom with the sliding French doors. Breakfast is very kid friendly with a wide and hearty selection of eggs, bacon, yogurt, etc. 

Bedding is very comfortable, clean and crisp. I am usually paranoid about my 1 yr old touching hotel floors and then putting his hands on his mouth but I was not worried here. Everything is so nice and new!

It's an easy 15-20 min walk to Disneyland. Very pleasant and safe. Large mall a block away with lots of food options. Decent swimming pool and large hot tub. 

Wish all hotels was as great as this one!

KellNJ,93,"Ocean Gate, New Jersey",2019-04-30,COUPLES,2019-04-10,5,Brand new with a caring staff!,"It’s so new you can still smell the fresh carpet in the hallways. We were greeted by a absolutely pleasant girl, Abby, who made check in a breeze. She explained anything we needed to know, and we were on our way. 

Stayed in a 2 queen suite, and it was very roomy!  On the 5th floor, ceilings were high which made it feel even bigger. Had a nice desk, and couch. The TV is bolted to the desk as stated in another review, however is swivels on the base and we had no problem what so ever viewing it from bed. Everything was clean and nice. Breakfast was actually pretty good!  They rotate the meats and other things, so there is usually something different everyday. Always a meat, egg, and potato. They also had bagels, English muffins, muffins, bananas, apples, cereal and of course a Waffle making station. Two mornings the cheese was empty (we put it on our eggs), and a staff member immediately replaces it for us. They cleared tables super fast, and always said good morning. Coffee is surprisingly really good!

The walk to Disneyland is not bad at all, and we did it for 4 days. It’s a good 20 minutes, and we’re pretty fast walkers. You hit a few lights, so timing can make it slightly longer or shorter. We enjoyed the walk in both the morning and evenings. There is a Starbucks, Walgreens, and CVS on the corner before you make the right toward Disneyland. Was great to be able to grab a soda or coffee on the walk. At night, it can be a little different, as you may pass by some folks sleeping under the bus stations. Harmless and no big deal. 

We are so glad we made the decision to stay here, it was perfect. ",,,,,,,,kristihampton,res supervisor,2019-04-11,"Thank you for taking the time to write such a stellar review KellNJ!

Morning breakfast at 6AM, waffle makers, eggs, a different meat daily, bagels, cereals the breakfast is quite good and is included with stay.

My only issue. Our room faced Katella Ave, all hours of the night from 10pm until 2-3am we heard a lot of fire trucks and ambulances blaring the siren and horn since the hotel is located at a 4 way intersection.

There was just a little noise from the street outside, but it wasn’t bad. The breakfast was pretty good - a typical Hampton Inn breakfast. I really appreciated that the night manager (sorry, I didn’t get his name) went to get “to go” breakfast for my daughter & I when we were leaving at 4:30 am for our flight home.

HKBHCB,28,,2019-03-31,BUSINESS,2019-03-30,2,Business Trip,"I stay in Hilton's weekly with work - This was not a good experience.  They charge $20 a day for parking! No break for Diamond members. The parking lot has minimal Diamond spaces.
The hotel is new so it does look and smell clean but the design leaves a lot to be desired.
I was so frustrated with the lights in the room.  They are on a timer and the timer cannot be disengaged if requested. In the evenings I would be working or trying to relax and I would have to get up multiple times in a dark room and walk around to trigger the light sensor. The first night of my arrival the window shade didn't work. Maintenance did fix it the next day. The room has a wet bar but there isn't a trashcan close by.  I had to pull the one by the desk over and it had the dividers for recycling.   I eat in my room with microwave food and I couldn't get the containers to fit in the trash can. The refrigerator was smaller than a dorm size fridge. I'm use to the dorm size from the other Hampton Inn and Suites I stay in.
The television is anchored to the desk in the center of the room.  It was placed so close to the wall that you couldn't angle the television to watch it comfortably from the bed or the couch.  The bathroom has no hook close to the shower to hang a towel. The towel hook is on the back of the door which means you have to step out of the shower wet in order to grab your towel.  There are no drawers or shelves in the bathroom. The only outlet is under a large very pointed sharp shelve that held the towels. I came so close to poking my eye and/or getting a laceration on my forehead.  I took a picture and sent it to my co-workers who all commented it looked dangerous.  The shelve between the beds  had no drawer. The bed was new and rock hard.  The pillows were nice. The only drawers in the room were the wire basket drawers and they faced the living room and not the sleeping area.  
I've stayed at the old Hampton Inn on Harbor (blocks from Disney) and was much more comfortable.  I am in this area every couple of months for work and I will not stay at this hotel again.",Ask for a  room not facing the busy street. Ask for a room facing the parking lot.,,4.0,2.0,3.0,,,,,,,48

The hotel was very clean and new, but that’s about all I can say that we liked about it. It didn’t have much personality.  Also, when I called to request 2 pack and plays the day we were checking in, I was informed that they could not accommodate us due to a fire codes. Our only option was to have the twins share a pack and play. We tried doing that and after the first night of no sleep, we packed up and drive home.

Most importantly, however, was the kind and accommodating staff. We were especially taken with how kind, professional, and informative Serena was to our whole family.

Jessica S,10,,2019-03-31,FAMILY,2019-03-21,4,Great New Hotel in the Resort Area,"My parents and I arrived late after a day at Disney and couldn't wait to check into our room. I used the Hilton Honors App to check in digitally, so I was able to secure a room earlier that day, but wasn't sure exactly where it would be located since there was no map or layout of the property. I stopped by the front desk to ask about parking and I was given a different ticket to have in and out access and parking charges added to my reservation. I also asked for a room key since the app doesn't always load the digital keys quickly. 

The lobby was bright and beautiful. Getting to our room took some time, with our tired legs and feet moving slowly down the long hall. It still smelled like fresh paint and carpet, which was nice. We opened  the door and were delighted to see a few balloons tied to a goody bag accompanied by a note. We were celebrating my dad's birthday and the team all signed his birthday card. It was a really nice touch! 

Not sure if my parents set the thermostat or we just left it as it was, but it was pretty stuffy all night. The bed wasn't the most comfortable, along with the new starchy sheets, but the pillows were really fluffy.

Breakfast was plentiful and yummy! 

Though we were only there for a few hours between checking in and checking out, it was a very pleasant experience. The staff was very friendly!

We arrived later on a Sunday just before a late dinner time.  Matthew was working the front desk and he was completely awesome.  Very professional, helpful, personable, kind, and just all around very pleasant.  The breakfast staff, the housekeeping staff, and the maintenance staff were all so helpful and kind.  
We were there for a Disney trip with family and the Parks were extremely busy.  So it was ALWAYS very pleasant to head back to our comfortable and very clean hotel to relax at the end of very long days.  The coffee and hot cocoa or hot tea waiting for us when we got back was also a very nice gesture.  
I highly recommend this hotel.  You will not be disappointed.  The location is great as it is within about a 20-25 minute walk to Disney and super easy to navigate by car from.  The property was very safe, as we did notice security walking the parking lot at times.  The room we had was the child/family suite.  The rooms were very clean and large and comfortable.

Friendly staff. Located about 15 minutes from the convention center with Disneyland across the street. The walk to Disney would be longer so you could probably hop one of the nearby Disney parking lot shuttles to the park. The hotel is located 1 block away from the Cheesecake Factory and a number of other restaurants. CVS and 7-Eleven were nearby too.

Breakfast was good with lots of options including waffles, eggs, oatmeal, bacon or sausage (alternated) plus cereal, milk, coffee with flavored creamers!

T0Sh55,26,"London, Canada",2019-03-31,FAMILY,2019-03-14,4,Decent hotel with some minor issues,"First of all the hotel is very nice. Its clean, new and the standard Hampton Inn services etc.  The breakfast was good and offerings varied daily (we stayed as a family for 6 nights while on a Disneyland vacation).  Our stay was largely enjoyable.  The only negatives that held back my review is the automatic lighting in the rooms is can be extremely aggravating to deal with. It was impossible to read at night without the lights going off every 5 minutes.  We asked the front desk if this could be adjusted and they said it could be (they wrote it down for maintenance) but it was never done. So on such a long stay this was frustrating.  Also, it is a fairly noisy hotel. Our suite faced Katella and the noise from the cars was noticeable at all hours. The pool area was nice but it should be noted that there are many unsupervised kids that don’t follow the posted rules. My kids 10 and 7 were uncomfortable as a result.  As for the bus service we did get an ART pass, but likely would not do it again.  The service was unreliable and shared with the Holiday Inn down the road. It was a little chaotic/uncomfortable at times. All this being said, for the price this was a good option for a Disneyland hotel.

However, at this hotel I received extraordinary care even from employees who didn't know my Hilton status. I did not note the names of all the employees who I encountered.

Mom of 5,1,,2019-02-28,FAMILY,2019-02-22,5,Exceptional staff and brand new hotel,"We come to Disneyland 4-5 times per year and have tried multiple hotels in the area. I saw this hotel pop up and saw that it was brand new so I figured we’d give it a try and I could not be more impressed. We arrived around 8pm and Mathew and Gorman checked us in, they were extremely friendly, welcoming, professional and started our stay on a positive note. The room we stayed in was huge, it had 2 queen beds (nice and comfy bedding) with a pull out couch, a desk and tons of floor space. The outdoor pool was heated and even though it was freezing outside it was heated enough that my kiddos were still able to swim in it while my hubby and I were able to relax in the hot tub. The complimentary breakfast had hot (sausage, eggs, waffles, hash browns) and cold foods (cereal, fresh cut fruit, bagels, yogurt) and all of the staff was smiling and helpful. When we checked out of the hotel Serena helped us and once again I was impressed with the hospitality of this hotel’s staff. 
Another plus about this hotel was the location. It is right across the street from several restaurants (The Cheesecake Factory, Bubba Gumps, California Pizza Kitchen) and it is a super easy walk to Disneyland. Me and my husband have both decided that this is our new favorite hotel in the area and will definitely be staying here again in the near future.",,,,,,,,kristihampton,res. supervisor ,2019-02-25,"Wow!

beaglemom46,13,"San Diego, California",2019-02-28,FAMILY,2019-02-20,5,New Hampton Inn...Wonderful Service,"This hotel is brand new.  From the moment I walked in, I liked this hotel.  The front desk attendant, Brenna, was welcoming and quickly checked my family into a quiet, high floor room as we had requested.  She  inquired to the reason for our stay which was both my husband's and my birthdays.  Brenna was very thoughtful and helped my family reserve our stay for two extra nights.  We were originally scheduled to stay at only hotel later in the weekend, but we decided we'd rather stay longer at the Hampton Inn after seeing the nice and quiet rooms and experiencing first class customer service. Brenna was still working when we came down for breakfast the next morning, which was my birthday.  She had rounded up the downstairs staff and had them sing Happy Birthday to me.  She presented me with a goody bag full of snacks and they game me a frosted muffin. It was very thoughtful of Brenna, Serena, and the rest of the staff to take time out of their mornings to bring a smile to my face.  

The rooms are a nice size and give you breathing room around the beds, desk, and sofa area.  It was helpful to have a mini fridge and a microwave in the room to store and warm up leftovers.  The housekeeping were continually working to keep the hallways dusted and cleaned.  There was a mix of breakfast items each morning and plenty of tables to sit and watch tv or look outside.  You did not feel like there was a mad rush to the food and find a place to sit like other hotels that serve a free breakfast.

I plan on staying at this hotel from now on when visiting the Disney area.  It was close enough to walk to the park or a quick Lyft ride instead.  We walked to several nearby restaurants within a 5 minute walk. 

Thanks again to Brenna and staff for making our birthdays' memorable and stress free!",,,5.0,,,5.0,5.0,kristihampton,Res. Supervisor,2019-02-21,"Hi beaglemom46!

The breakfast buffet had the usual items.  All the workers were helpful, there was plenty of food for all the guests and plenty of places to sit and enjoy the food.  Parking is $20 a night. The property itself is within a 20 minute walk to the Disneyland car drop off point.  You can also go through the ""Anaheim Garden Walk"" to get to Disneyland.

Disneyland and downtown are nearby so it was convenient to get a lyft and not have to pay for parking.  ",,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,kristihampton,Res.

Any issues we had would be considered recent opening hiccups and the staff rectified them quickly. Didn’t get a chance to try out the pool as the weather was poor but it looked really good. ,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,kristihampton,Res.

Jeremie,1,"Libertyville, Illinois",2019-02-28,FRIENDS,2019-02-15,5,New Hotel and Professional Staff!,"I spent two nights here while visiting Disneyland. The hotel is only a 15 minute walk to the front entrance of the park with many dining and shopping options nearby, including an outdoor mall a block away. The hotel is fairly large for a Hampton Inn and there are many selections for breakfast. My room was on the 5th floor facing the street and I didn't hear any street noise throughout my stay. I definitely plan on staying again when in the area. Great staff!","Odd number rooms face Katella Ave, while even number rooms face a giant parking lot for Disneyland employees.",,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,kristihampton,Reservations Supervisor,2019-02-18,"Hi JerryKoala, thanks so much for your five-star review on our new hotel!

alissaj,1,,2019-02-28,FAMILY,2019-02-09,5,Great Hotel Stay,"One of the best hotel experiences I've had. Apart from it being brand new and extremely clean, each and every staff member was friendly and helpful. Antonio helped us upon arrival, and he made the check in process smooth and quick. I felt welcomed from the moment I stepped foot into the hotel, up until the moment I left. Breakfast was great, and the pool deck was a cool little place to chill. The hotel was also located in a convenient place, if planning to go to the Disneyland Parks. I am looking forward to booking our next hotel stay here at the Hampton!!",,,5.0,,,5.0,5.0,Passenger60608270097,Reservations Supervisor,2019-02-13,"Hi xoalissaa!

Eric F,36,"Diamond Bar, California",2019-02-28,BUSINESS,2019-02-06,4,Business: UBM/MD&M Convention Anaheim,"Pros:
1) Brand new hotel. Therefore everything is brand new and not worn like just about everything else in the area.
2) Staff is nice - even if still learning their jobs. They are professional and accommodating and eager to help.
3) Breakfast Selection is good
4) King sized rooms are spacious and some actually have bunk beds plus a sleeping sofa making it a nice fit for families of 5.
5) On-site parking
6) Rates are on par with other hotels
7) Did I mention everything is brand new?

Cons:
1) The pains of not working out all the kinks and bugs before rushing to open the hotel before the convention.
2) No internet access - WiFi has been sporadically working (uptime maybe 10%) for the past two days (since check in)and they do not have LAN cables in order to hard wire connect in case it’s just a WiFi router issue and not an internet issue. :(
3) The rooms have a motion sensor that kills all lights in the room. This should go away. It’s really annoying to either be working on the desk, be watching tv, reading, or doing something that does not require much movement to have the lights go out in the evening/nighttime.

Overall a good stay which would have been excellent if the bugs had been worked out prior to opening the hotel for business. Especially in an area such as Anaheim where you have the Convention Center/Disneyland/Anaheim Stadium/Honda Center all within 5-10 minutes of the hotel. This being a business stay it was imperative that internet connectivity was available- and unfortunately it was not.",,,,,,,,AntonioRamos2019,Front Office Manager,2019-02-08,"Thank you so much for your feedback from your recent stay with us.
