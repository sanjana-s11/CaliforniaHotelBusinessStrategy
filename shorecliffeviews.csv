shellyadk,1,,2021-12-31,NONE,2021-12-04,1,Not pet friendly and very dirty.,"Picked this property as it advertises as being pet friendly. What we found is it's more pet ""tolerant"" than friendly.  There is no a green area for the pets, there is a ~50sq Ft area of AstroTurf right in front of some of the rooms and that's it.  The room was decent for an older property but was filthy.  They have cards posted in the room stating that they only clean every three days, apparently that does not include between guests.  We had hair on the walls and ceiling in the bathroom, unknown ""stuff"" on the walls, hand prints and smudges on the widows and mirrors, a thick layer of dust on the shelves, mold on the patio door frame, and what appeared to be blood on the bathroom floor and mirror.  We requested a cleaning and more soap, what we received was the bed being made and the towels replaced, but no cleaning and no soap.  I would not stay there again and encourage others to look elsewhere.",,1.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,,,,,0

We drive for Los Angeles, so it was a 2 3/4 hour drive, but through some nice areas.  On our way, we were arriving a bit early, so I called from the car and requested an early check-in. Although the hotel was at capacity, Tina took my name an number, to let me know if they could accommodate. Approximately 45 minutes later, I received a call that our room was ready.

We arrived and checked in quickly. We were able to get a quick nap from our drive.

Thw room was very spacious.  We were pleasantly surprised to see robes in the closet.  The room had a “large” mini fridge, microwave and sink.

A couple of complimentary bottled waters and a room safe.  The bathroom had lots of towels and all the amenities.

We never had to ask for a thing during our stay.

All of the staff, including housekeeping were friendly and seemed to be working diligently.

We were going to plan our trip to Coronado, but didn’t want to deal with the traffic.  So glad we went to Pismo!

Wendy M,1,"Santa Cruz, California",2021-11-30,NONE,2021-11-11,5,Incredible,"I booked this hotel for a birthday trip to Pismo beach and San Luis Obispo. When we arrived at the hotel we had been assigned a room without an ocean view. My son asked the receptionist if we could change our room to one with a view of the ocean. The receptionist went to work finding us a beautiful room on the third floor looking out towards the ocean. It was beautiful!!   The beds were incredibly comfortable, the room spotless the bathroom was as big as my studio apt back home.  There was a microwave, mini fridge and sink. The staff were super nice. The free breakfast was even impressive. To top it off I'm a lover of Pelicans and other sea birds. The pelicans used the cliffs near the Gazebo (located a short walk from the hotel) as a place to roost at night. I was up early in the morning, walked to the Gazebo and found myself a few feet from them. It was delightful seeing them take off one after another gliding over the sea. I will definitely stay here again when I visit this area.  I really love Morro Bay, Pismo Beach and San Luis Obispo and this hotel is close to all of those areas.

PAT,3,,2021-10-31,NONE,2021-11-05,5,Eureka- nailed it!,"I did a lot of online research to plan a long weekend trip to Central CA beach area that was within about a 5 hour drive from San Diego where we live.  We chose Pismo Beach because of its proximity to the sand dunes in Oceano (which we really wanted to see) as well as San Luis Obispo, Morro Bay and Paso Robles.  Pismo Beach turned out to be the perfect location.  Once we settled on Pismo Beach I did an extensive online search for our hotel.  This was a special birthday trip so I wanted to find a hotel that was right for this occasion. I wanted an upscale room with an ocean view and also a good breakfast included.  We also wanted to be able to bring our dog, but did not want to have to sacrifice hotel room quality or beauty, which can be the case for many hotels offering dog friendly rooms. We also wanted easy access to walking trails to walk our dog.   Shore Cliff Hotel seemed to satisfy all of these requirements so I booked us for 4 nights.  You know that feeling of trepidation when you first arrive at the hotel you have selected online?  Will it be as nice as I anticipated?  Well, Shore Cliff Hotel certainly met our expectations and much more. Our room was quiet, other than the sound of pounding waves which was great!  Walk through the lobby and right behind the hotel is a fantastic  walking trail that skirts the ocean bluffs. And the complimentary breakfast was excellent with plenty of variety of both hot and cold food including make your own waffles and home made tamales.  It was so nice that we decided to extend our stay and will certainly return.

vben4d,8,"Bakersfield, California",2021-10-31,NONE,2021-10-20,5,Perfect getaway,"While vacationing in Pismo my boyfriend and I stayed at Shore Cliff Hotel. I've been eyeing to stay at the Shore Cliff Hotel the next time I was in Pismo for a while as everything about this hotel seemed perfect. I am happy to say the perception I had was true! Our stay at Shore Cliff Hotel was nothing but perfect! At check in we were greeted and checked in by Lulu, the guest services manager. She was friendly and got us check in quickly. I also noticed Lulu replies to almost every review. I love that she replies to reviews because it shows that Shore Cliff Hotel values the opinion of others; both good and bad. During 4 night stay, we stayed in a pier view room. The room was clean, spacious, and the pier view was breathtaking. The grounds of the hotel was well kept. Almost every inch of the hotel offered such scenic views since the hotel is located on the cliffs of Pismo Beach. Along the cliffs of the hotel you will be able to see a sanctuary of birds ranging from California Brown Pelicans, Seagulls snd Night Herons. It was interesting to see the wild life up close and personal. Also during our stay my boyfriend and I enjoyed many of the services and amenities the hotel had to offer such as, the pool and hot tub, complimentary breakfast, gym and the swings around the property. Our stay at Shore Cliff Hotel was the perfect getaway from home. I would recommend to anyone visiting the pismo area. I can't wait to go back in the near future!",,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,Lulu Lawag,Guest Services / Front Office,2021-10-22,"Wow!  Thank you for sharing your great review about your most recent visit.

DavidMonaDrew,1,"Fresno, California",2021-10-31,NONE,2021-10-18,5,Best beach vacation ever!,"We've never stayed in an oceanfront hotel before but we decided to this time because we were celebrating our wedding anniversary and our son's birthday. IT WAS AMAZING!!! The staff were all very friendly and professional. They even prepared a heart with rose pedals on the bed for us and a super cute elephant made of towels for our son. The room was spotless and the view was awesome. We could hear and see the waves the whole time which made it so relaxing. We enjoyed the breakfast each morning in the garden and a nightly beach walk to the pier for dinner each night. Never having to think about finding parking added to our no-stress weekend, because we just walked everywhere. The property is so pretty and well maintained. We originally booked for only 2 nights, but it was so nice that we didn’t want our weekend to end. We asked the front desk if there were any available rooms for us to stay one more night. Fortunately, our room was available and they gave us a sweet deal on our third night room price, too! This was the best beach vacation we've ever had! We plan to save up our money and do it again ASAP!

Never missed the daily housekeeping at all, they have a text system and you text and they're at your door pronto with whatever you need.   Our first room was very dark and near the center of the building, I went back to the desk and asked to be moved, we moved to 204 and the view was awesome.    I can't say enough about the housekeeping staff, really wonderful!   The breakfast bar was good, hot selections every morning which were good.  Fresh fruit, including strawberries which was great also.  But, no oatmeal except the packets full of sugar.  Would have preferred a pot of oatmeal or at least some low sugar/healthier packet selections.    Overall, I loved this place and would go back in a minute.

abeasley19,1,"Bakersfield, California",2021-08-31,NONE,2021-09-25,2,Beautiful view but room was dirty,"The room itself was very big and accommodated our big family but it is the only room they have to accommodate a family of 6. However, we were told the couch turned into a couch bed but it did not pull out into a bed. After calling the lobby about it, staff basically said grab a pillow and blanket and now its a bed, like really? 
Checking in was extremely disappointing! We were told the room was still being cleaned at arrival and after at least 30 minutes passed the hotels check-in time (4pm), we finally got into the room only to find it not cleaned properly. There was trash just sitting on the table in plain site as soon as we entered the room, a bunch of popcorn under the couch cushions, and something was stuck on the wall. The staff only offered us a bottle of wine (we even told them we don't drink) and a few bottles of apple cider for the kids to make up for the late check-in time. Nothing was done about the cleanliness of the room! The room we stayed in was very expensive for each night and you'd think the room would have been cleaned better, especially for as long as we waited! Mind you there is a 4 hour time frame between check-out and check-in times for guests. The staff wasn't very friendly and were not welcoming during our stay.

Loved the beach access - we walked on it everyday going to Pismo Beach (for great coffee at Kraken and Scorpion Bay!) - about a mile walk to pier and town.  The complimentary breakfast was a pleasant surprise/more than we expected with many options including scrambled eggs, bacon or sausage, fresh bagels, yogurt, hard-boiled eggs, fresh fruit  etc.   Also love the absence of a ""Resort Fee""  -- free parking and wifi along with the breakfast.  Tons of pelicans nesting on the cliffs and lots of seagulls - we did close our sliding glass door after the 1st night because the seagulls woke us too early but with it closed we could barely hear them and it didn't bother us again.",,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,Lulu Lawag,Guest Services / Front Office,2021-09-20,"Thank you for choosing to stay with us during your 3 day getaway to the central coast.

I am happy you enjoyed our hotel.  The bird sanctuary located on our property is a delight to see.  Unfortunately, they do leave their waste around the property which mixed with the ocean can be a dissatisfying odor.  Due to the drought, we have had to limit the amount of times we can rinse off the sidewalks and landscapes at our location.  Also, it is against the law to disturb the birds habitat.  Despite this, we hope to be able to welcome you back on a return visit to Pismo Beach.

strizek88,146,"Nashville, Tennessee",2021-08-31,NONE,2021-08-19,3,Nothing more than a good location,"Overall we had a decent stay, but certainly nothing to recommend. I'm perplexed by the five-star reviews. I know I have high standards, but there's simply no way this hotel deserves a five-star review. Their writeup boasts ""resort-quality amenities and services"", but I'd love to hear how they back that up.

Room was clean, but definitely had a dated/worn feeling. The kind of room where when you excitedly open the door and walk in, you kinda just frown and sigh. The shower grout was in desperate need of a good scrubbing. The water is super soft - like, the softest I'd ever experienced. This is a huge irritation for me, as it means shower length is doubled in order to feel adequately rinsed off. (I will never understand the allure of soft water.)

Lots of kiddos at the pool/hot tub, so if you're looking for quiet relaxation, look elsewhere. Oh, and grab a pool towel when you can because they ran out two afternoons in a row and took about an hour to bring more.

Breakfast was fine, but it's the same thing every day. Try not to go at a busy time because the room layout is kind of a mess and you might not get a table.

Polite and helpful front desk staff & speedy check-in process
Very accommodating to all requests and questions.
Beautiful pool area with comfortable chaises in a secure area
More than ample breakfast buffet including hot foods like eggs & sausage.
Beautiful views of ocean and coastline from our ocean-front balcony
Air-conditioning - even though temps were not overly hot the room was mildly stuffy and having AC was definitely welcomed.
Helpful staff in getting our luggage up the stairs to our room.
Located near downtown for restaurants and shopping

Cons:
No elevator in the main (front) building.  My ol' arthritic knees were not thrilled about numerous trips per day up and down several flights of stairs to get to our room or the pool.
I was excited to have Bath & Body Works products to use during my stay.  While there was a small bottle of lotion and bar of soap on the bathroom counter, the body wash, shampoo and conditioner were in hard to use dispensers in the shower.  Hard bottles affixed to the wall where you had to squeeze both sides in order to attempt to dispense the product you wanted to use. I ended up bathing with shampoo b/c the body wash dispenser was either empty or just too hard for me to use.  The conditioner barely came out of the dispenser at all.  Not a fan of this ""improvement"" over the little one-use bottles most hotels have.
The mattress in our King bed was hard.  Like HARD.  No give whatsoever. Yikes.
I guess there's nothing the hotel can do about the number of birds that reside on the rocks right outside of the ocean front rooms, but wow.... the stench of the ""bird poo"" is almost overwhelming, and the amount of bird droppings on railings, door knobs to the pool, etc is not pleasant.  I've stayed at other coastal hotels and never seen it this bad.

We did enjoy our stay at Shore Cliff and would recommend this hotel to other travelers.","The 3 story buildings have an elevator, or so I&#39;m told.

Mary C,72,"Los Angeles, California",2021-07-31,NONE,2021-08-17,1,"Stay Away, Dirty, no Masks and they don't care and will call you names.","Stay far, far away. This hotel has no idea how to control Covid, their employees and guests. The hotel is super pretty from the outside--should be for what we paid. Parking is okay.

Check in was a nightmare. First the woman at the desk had no mask on--is she trying to kill me. We waited over an hour past check in, and not one person came to us and said what was up or they were sorry for the wait.

Then we get to the floor of the room and to my horror, cleaning staff--that would be all that I saw, were walking around, in and out of rooms without masks on. I avoided them as best as I could ang got to our room. Now, the real fun starts.

The room was dirty, clearly not cleaned the way it should be in, gee, a pandemic and the bathroom was not cleaned at all. Someone used it. My room was supposed to have a full pier view--we paid for that, it did not. The balcony had cig. butts on it. I kid you not.

I had quite enough and asked if we could just leave and get out money refunded. The answer was no, but they said they would be happy to send someone to clean. They did and she had a mask, around her neck. I did not let her in to potentially give me Covid. Back in the car and to a store to buy cleaning supplies. I cleaned the place myself. 

The TV had finger prints all over it, the remove was damp or greasy, I am not sure which. I will never return. Please stay away. I value your happiness and life as well. And to top off the fun, as I was walking by a woman at the front desk, no mask, said to her friend there is the bitch.

Courtney M,2,,2021-08-31,NONE,2021-08-13,1,Overpriced & rundown,"Room 123 should not be considered ocean view- it looks into pool equipment/storage area. Room 222 toilet never worked properly; maintenance looked at it twice and it constantly broke so bad we had to keep plunger outside of the door of our hotel room and after each use, the lid to tank had to be removed and parts messed with to even flush. Maintenance walked in on me undressed to fix toilet an hour and a half before the scheduled appointment time. Housekeeping came in 30 minutes early/before our late check out regardless of me saying no please come back... again, while I was not dressed. The WiFi did not work, ever. The spa was closed for some odd reason- even though I confirmed twice before our checkin that it was open and fully operational. Multiple lounge chair/swing chairs on property had caution tape on them and were inoperable. I had to call  and remind housekeeping for more towels and bottled water, so much so we were nearly late for our dinner reservation as we were waiting on clean towels to shower.  At checkout I tried to explain the constant issue with our hotel room toilet and was told “oh we probably need a plumber.” At no point on day 1 did they try to accommodate us and move us into a nicer room given the inconvenience during this special trip. The hotel is located on a cliff side and while the pelicans and seagulls on the property are out of the hotels control, I suggest people to stay elsewhere as the other hotels next door didn’t have the bird issue or the smell.

Yes, but everything else is disappointing.

There is not elevator to some rooms so be ready to carry your bag upstairs.

Breakfast is awful. A tiny cramped room with not enough tables and self service bagels, cereal and bacon, like a cheap motel.

Bird droppings on the outdoor loungers and an unclean pool.

I could go on.

Basically this place is being absolutely milked for every penny they can get.

It's expensive and no where near good enough.

Kitchen was stocked with plates, cups, wine glasses, utensils, water, coffee, tea, etc.  Bring snacks for the fridge - they also have vending machines with snacks, ramen, candy, etc.  Both rooms and the living room had large balconies with seating - very nice.  One large bathroom with a tub, shower and two sinks - one sink outside of the bathroom door.  The kids went to the pool and walked to the beach daily.  About a 10-15 minute walk along the beach to get to the Pismo Beach Pier where you can shop, eat, etc.  Free breakfast is always a plus with a large family or group.

I’ve always found them to be simple, clean, well-managed enterprises that have exceeded my expectations. The Shore Cliff Hotel is no longer affiliated with BW, and has stepped up their game. It’s not a luxury 5 star resort, and is priced accordingly.  It is a gracious, clean, well-run, newly renovated hotel  with stunning views and the sounds and smells of the rugged coast right at your doorstep (or balcony to be more precise!)  For anyone who loves the sea, it does not get better than this!  They lent me a champagne glass. And I saw them bringing another guest a bottle of wine and 2 wine glasses. The buffet breakfast was included in the price and way exceeded expectations!  The food was plentiful, varied and delicious. Fresh beef tamales, eggs with bacon or sausage, hot and cold cereals, a huge bowl of fresh washed whole strawberries, and warm waffles right off the griddle!

edkimpr1me,2,"San Jose, California",2021-06-30,NONE,2021-06-24,4,Everything was great! EXCEPT....,"The Hotel location, view, amenities were great!  The staff were super friendly.  And the fact that they had pet friendly rooms was a huge plus to bring our dog to enjoy as well!  EXCEPT for the following:
1)  when we tried to book and get a special rate through their website, for some reason it did not let us book the full 5 days we wanted.  We called the desk and they said they were able to reserve it through their system.  Unfortuantely they didn't apply the rate we expected from the web reservation.  We ended up paying the full rate, which we didn't discover until we actually got to the hotel and had no choise.  
2) We requested a pet friendly room, which are limited in availability.  When they made the reservation, they assigned us an ADA room, but didn't notify us that this was the case.  We don't need  an ADA room, and again, we didn't discover this until we actually got to the hotel, and all the other rooms were booked.  The big difference with ADA is that there is no bathtub, just a small lip (this is for wheelchair access). The problem is, when you take a shower, the water spills over to the bathroom floor.  Now, when you need to use the bathroom, the floor is wet.  There is a drain in the middle of the bathroom, but the floor is still damp. We ended up having to use a TON of towels so that our socks or feet would not get wet after someone took a shower.  
3) I didn't know this but I think due to Covid, they only turned over the room every 3 days. With the amount we paid, I would think that they would figure out how to get our room cleaned daily.  Thats the difference between a hotel and renting a house..  

Aside from that, the Hotel itself had a beautiful view!  The pool and hot tub were very nice.  And the breakfasts were very good as well.  They had very good solutions to stay in compliance with COVID protection for continental breakfasts.  and the grounds/walking areas around the hotel were spectacular.

However, the toilet ran, the refrigerator pooled water on the shelves and the walls were thin for both noise and smells.

Dhun2010,14,"Chino Hills, California",2021-03-31,NONE,2021-03-22,5,Perfect For a Relaxing Getaway!,"My 12 Senior Citizen friends (12 minus 1 not yet senior) and I (6 couples) spent three fun-filled, memorable and relaxing days at this property from March 16-19, 2021. After reading numerous TripAdvisor Reviews and researching various properties we decided on the Shore Cliff Hotel. I had several conversations with Valerie and Derek prior to booking this property.  Valerie and Derek were patient and extremely helpful in advising us of the amenities, guest room locations, etc. One of the couples needed an ADA room, and I was informed that there was only ONE ADA room available at the time of our booking which was almost two months before our trip. 

The weekend prior to our trip, my friend was notified that the contractor working on the ADA bathroom renovation was unable to deliver the bathroom in time for her stay. We do understand that at times things are not always under one’s control, and unforeseen problems appear.  Undoubtedly, we were all disappointed when our friend shared the news.  Immediately after that the General Manager, Barbara Parra came to my friend’s rescue!!  Ms. Parra was exceptionally responsive to her needs, communicated with her promptly, assured her not to worry, and went above and beyond to find my friend an ADA Suite at their Sister Property--Pismo Lighthouse Suites. Many thanks to Ms. Parra from all 12 of us!  You eased our tension, and we sincerely appreciate all your efforts.

In keeping guests’ well-being paramount, the hotel has implemented enhanced standards authorized by the County to ensure safety, hygiene and physical distancing at all times. Masks are mandatory for all guests and the hotel staff while on property, and we really appreciated that.

We had two Oceanfront Rooms, three Ocean/Pool View rooms 320, 218, 220 at the Shore Cliff Hotel and one ADA Rm 2201at the Lighthouse Suites.  All our rooms were clean, spacious and very comfortable. The hotel staff is very courteous and helpful. Even with Covid protocols breakfast choices were plenty.

The ambiance of the hotel has left a lasting impression on us all.  The property and the grounds overlooking the ocean are absolutely breathtaking—gorgeous sunsets from our balconies!!

All in all, Shore Cliff Hotel, Pismo Beach is a great place to relax and rewind, and we would not hesitate to recommend to family and friends, and of course come back.

Extremely happy with the experience. Highly recommend.

Thank you all!",,,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,Tina Jenkins,Guest Services / Front Office,2021-03-23,"Thank you for staying with us and for sharing your detailed 5 star review for other travelers.

There was a loud party our first night there and they did nothing to shut it down even when called and advised. They also take forever to answer the front desk phone when you need assistance. I understand they get busy, but every time I tried calling, the phone just kept ringing. The bed is uncomfortable, the WiFi was spotty, the lamps shorted out quite often/the plugs in the room didn’t all work, and we were woken up every single morning by a semi truck that was pulling into and out of the lot. There wasn’t one day that we had a good nights rest. Like I mentioned before the view is breathtaking, but I will not be staying here again nor would I recommend it to family and friends.

The bedding wasn't clear, blanked had some spots of something red. 
A/C is extremely noisy too, you can not use it overnight to heat the room.
Also, people smoke weed right on the balconies, at least the next two rooms next to us met the sunrise with joints.
So if you young, don't have kids and looking for hotel to hang out, it's might will work for you, but it's definitely not for a family vacation.

I loved the ""text concierge"" feature, especially in COVID times. When we needed more towels or coffee, a simple text managed that request. The continental breakfast was superior to most. In addition to the standard coffee, juice, and cereal, they had hot waffles, sous-vide egg bites, breakfast burritos, breakfast sandwiches, soy milk, and more; something for everyone.

johnvang102,1,"Fresno, California",2021-01-31,NONE,2021-02-01,1,Ants,"My room had ants for a $200/night Saturday overnight stay. Called management and they said everything was booked at ~8 pm and all they could do was come and spray the room or leave with a refund or ignore the ants. I vetoed that idea because of covid and felt spraying wouldn't get the ants already around the kitchenette area and decided to just ignore the issue. At ~2 am, I woke up to pee and there more were ants all over the counter in the restroom and found a few on the bed as well. That was when I called management and they found another room for us to move into. (A room opened up pretty fast ironically...) 

For $200/night, I expect an ant-free experience in my hotel room. I've stayed here before and thought the experience would've been smooth sailing but I'll take my business elsewhere next time. Total bull. 

*Talked to management and they only gave me a $50 discount on my stay when I checked out. I'm pissed enough to come to write this review because there were ants in my room and I needed to move all my crap into another room in the middle of the night. Bottom line - I wasn't taken care of. *

That's the last time I'll be staying here.",,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,Barbara Parra,Owner,2021-02-05,"Hello Mr. Vang,
We sincerely apologize that your stay with us was anything less than exceptional. We pride ourselves in providing superior customer service and are disappointed you did not feel that.  As you know from your previous stays at Shore Cliff we do not usually have an issue with ants.  However, after a week of rain, ants seek shelter indoors and this comes with its own challenges for our hotel. After following up with you personally after check-out, I hope we reached an acceptable resolution, and we hope to provide a better experience in the future.  We look forward to the possibility of welcoming you back.  

Best Regards,

Thank you for your candid feedback regarding your recent stay. I am very disappointed to hear that your stay at the hotel was not up to par. As you know from your previous visits, this is not the typical level of service and cleanliness you have come to experience from our location.  Unfortunately, after heavy rains, insects seek shelter indoors and this causes some unique challenges for the hotel. We apologize that you had to move rooms and know this was an inconvenience for you. After discussing your recent stay over the phone, I believe we’ve reached a resolution and hope you come back and give us another try to exceed your expectations.

Despite the restrictions and effort that the Republic of California has put on the hospitality industry these guys are overcoming it. It’s a shame that housekeepers, groundskeepers and good workers have been let go at properties like this.
As long as Gavin and Nancy can command services to be provided for them and travel whenever and wherever they want they are good with others and middle income families being forced to see the impact of their selfishness. Local business shuttered, public piers shut down, many middle income families not able to afford travel and support the common workers of Pismo Beach but private yacht club is still functional. Lol.
I hope people use common sense and get out of the house and support these businesses.
This hotel is a little older but had been made new. Our favorite place to go without compromising our children’s college fund.",,,,,,,,,,,,7

nicsmaldonado4,1,"Los Angeles, California",2021-01-31,NONE,2021-01-18,5,The Views Were Everything,"Stayed here for my husband’s birthday getaway- 2 nights. Check-in was fast & easy. Breakfast in the morning was included in our stay. This was extremely helpful & made our mornings easy. Due to COVID it was grab & go. We enjoyed the hot item of the day; waffles with coffee & fruit. There were many other things to choose from. We took food back to our room & ate on the patio watching the sunrise. It was one of the best ways to start our day. We had partial ocean & pool view. From our room we saw 85-90% of the ocean on the 3rd floor. Slept well. One evening was a bit warm- (crazy California winter in January), so we left the patio sliding door open with the shutters closed in front of them to let the wonderful breeze & sounds of the waves in our room. 
Room was not the biggest but it was cozy & just right. Not the newest hotel nor the oldest. But those details didn’t bother me. Everything was clean & ready for us upon arrival. King bed was comfy.  For being a small hotel, (only 3 floors) it didn’t feel cramped at all. It felt just right. Besides we were out & about after breakfast both days. Many hikes were just minutes on foot from the hotel. We did a 4 mile hike then got take out, next door to hotel at Ventana Grill. Beach access is super easy too. Roughly a 5-7 minute walk down to the beach all the while you have that gorgeous ocean view as you head down. Sunsets were gorgeous. Plenty of outdoor seating around the hotel, to enjoy takeout, the view, a drink or good book which helps with COVID. So you don’t feel obligated to go back to your room. Pool was open for a longer period of time than I expected. I went to Vegas in July & hours were limited for the pool in the dead of July heat! So that was nice. Heated pool? Not too sure about that though. That was the only bummer. Many dogs in the hotel & in the ones surrounding it. Didn’t feel like it was noisy or chaotic at all. All the pets seemed to be happy to be somewhere new with their owners. 
I’d recommend it to anyone looking for a sweet time to rest & refresh the soul. Thank you to Vicky for serving us coffee & breakfast both mornings. Great hospitality😃 Came back home feeling rested after our 3 hour drive. I don’t always feel rested after vacations. Cannot wait to return & catch another sunset. Thank you, Shore Cliff Hotel!",,,,,,,,,,,,0

Many of the rooms have spectacular views of the ocean and pretty much all of them have some sort of ocean view.  We spend three nights simply enjoying the ocean and the views.  Given the COVID restrictions, the service of the rooms is limited to providing towels or other requested items which is fine for a short stay.  

They do have a breakfast service of pre-packaged items that are necessarily limited but enough to get by with. There are restaurants for take-out and some patio dining within walking distance.  Takeout in the room or out on the room patio of was just fine for a relaxing time for a few days.

Note in the main building around the office all rooms are exterior access and if you are on the second floor there is no elevator so if stairs are a problem get a ground floor room.

Joel S.,4,,2020-12-31,FAMILY,2020-12-07,5,Just What the Doctor Ordered,"My time at Shore Cliff was nothing short of shear bliss. My family and I were celebrating our daughters 13th birthday. When we arrived, we were blown away with what we had gotten ourselves into. After we turned down the sloping driveway parked, we entered the lobby via automated doors like the ones found at a grocery store. The lobby doesn't have anything out of the ordinary; public computer, tv, sofas and chairs, Pismo Beach and Shore Cliff Hotels shirts, hoodies and hats. The usual. The thing that makes Shore Cliff's lobby standout is your ability to see clear through the walls of glass to the calling sea. We walked through the grocery style doors into the lobby, right out the back through another door that led to a beautiful courtyard with a winding path. There is some sort of reclining, circular rocking swing for 2-3 you can stargaze in. Or you have head down to the gazebo at the edge of the cliff that overlooks the sea. 

After we checked in we went to drop off our bags. We had a double queen with an ocean view on the 1st floor. The room is great, very comfy. We found everything we needed. It was about this time that I got a text. It was from the hotel! They informed me all I had to do was text them and ask for whatever I needed. I immediately asked for more towels. We had a sliding glass door that we could open and go out to a patio with 2 chairs and a little table that also was overlooking the ocean. There was a concrete sidewalk that you could walk along as you took in the view, or head to the parking lot or nearby restaurant. Since there was no wall or fence separating us from walking down from our back patio to the path, we stepped down and continued our ocean viewing. We took our birthday cake and presents down to the gazebo. My daughter was so excited to open presents while eating cake, as she stood under a gazebo staring at the sea as the sun set. After that we did some exploring. The pathway went from the restaurant, along the coast to the gazebo area, over to the pool. The pool is heated, and has a wall of glass allowing you to enjoy a swim while you not only soak in the rays, but the gorgeous view. There are picnic tables for you to sit at and enjoy a snack or meal, and benches are also scattered here and there to sit and enjoy the view.

Breakfast was the normal things, grab and go style; waffles, breakfast burritos, packaged pastries from a local bakery. It was a large spread! Amazing hotel that we will be staying at again very soon!!!!",,,,,,,,Lulu Lawag,Guest Services / Front Office,2020-12-12,"Thank you for taking the time to share your 5 star experience with all of us on TripAdvisor.

Same great location and views but rooms and amenities have seen big upgrades. Great walking paths with stairs down to the beach. Some hotels and restaurants and other organizations have struggled during COVID-19, but a few have excelled. This is one of those who have figured out how to follow all health and safety rules while still providing top notch service and comfort. Staff was friendly and helpful and professional. Room was awesome. The free breakfast was better than I could have imagined, given current health restrictions. Our biggest complaint? At high tide the waves crashing into the beach and rocks can be a little loud, so you won't want to leave the balcony door open if trying to sleep. We will be back to this hotel on our next trip to this area.",Best views on 2nd floor but no elevator so be aware you will have to climb some stairs.

Despite the spectacular view from our room, we could not use the balcony, the table and chairs on the balcony, or leave the balcony door open to hear the sound of the waves and feel the cool air all because of the overpowering stench from the pelicans down below on the rocks.  A suitable warning from the hotel and an offer of a different room was lacking.  This is WRONG because the hotel is very much aware of the odor problem and could have offered a different room. So ASK about the odor and pick a room away from the main building.  What you lose in the view will be made up in the ability to use your balcony.

Not that big a deal, but it would have been nice if I was told that at booking or check-in, but instead, after a long and wonderful day out in the town, my wife and I came back to our room to find the towels weren’t changed, bed wasn’t  made, no coffee or condiments. Well there went our relaxing time! I went to grab a drink we had in the refrigerator and found that the refrigerator wasn’t working, drinks are hot, all of our deli and cheese was warm, there went our planned romance time! I call the desk, and I was told that they don’t provide room service due to COVID-19. If I knew this in advance, I would have made arrangements before we went out for the day. (Well, except for the refrigerator issue) Finally after several hours of waiting for someone to bring towels, fix refrigerator, bring coffee and condiments, run to the store to replace hot drinks and most likely spoiled deli and cheese, we could finely relax and have alone, us time! Then the large dog next door starting barking and howling intermittently all night an into the morning. If the hotel is going to allow dogs, then perhaps, some type of segregation is in order? I don’t want to try to tell you how to run your business, but I would like you to understand that when my wife and I want a relaxing getaway, someone else’s barking and howling dog right next door is NOT very relaxing or romantic!",,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,Lulu Lawag,Guest Services / Front Office,2020-11-12,"Thank you for taking the time to provide us with your feedback.

My son loved how deep the pool was. (9ft) The hotel is very close to shops. The views on the property are truly amazing. I loved they offered glider swings so enjoy the views. They had the best grab and go breakfast I've seen since Covid hit. The rooms and large which was nice with a family of 4. The only issues I had was for some reason my key would stop working randomly. Sometimes it would take me 20 trys before the door would actually open and that was with getting my card replaced. Due to all the birds it was sometimes hard to enjoy outside because they smell awful. We were disappointed the hot tub was still out of service due to covid since that was one of the main reasons we chose this location. We were stuck in a cloud coming off the mountain the entire time we were there. It was cold and wet but a mile down the road was warm and nothing but sunshine.

This place has amazing views but the smell from the hundreds and hundreds of birds is atrocious. There is literally bird poop everywhere!!!! The flies are really bad too. I know that is environmental but it’s really hard to enjoy your stay when you can’t be outside or keep your screen door open. We walked to town twice and noticed each time that the resorts next to us - Sea Crest and the Cottage In were much more livelier and didn’t have that awful smell like ours did. The room was small and dated. The beds weren’t overly comfortable and there were so many flies in our room it was insane. The concierge did offer to send someone over to kill the flies but we made the kids do it. The restaurant next door Ventanna Grill is pretty decent. We also went to Willows at the Sea Crest and a few places in town to eat. Nothing spectacular. All in all it was an okay weekend but we won’t stay here again. ,,1.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,Tina Jenkins,Guest Services / Front Office,2020-10-14,"Thank you for staying with us and taking the time to share your review.

Stephanie V,1,,2020-10-31,COUPLES,2020-10-10,2,2020 Strikes Again,"Warning for those considering traveling on the second half of 2020, there is construction in the main road behind the hotel that goes from midnight until four am. June to November. 

The vent. Not noticing the signs on our way from up North, when the construction started my husband called the desk to complain. They said it was completely unexpected and that ""something happened"". It wasn't until we checked out that we saw the signs getting on the road that says ""Construction June to November"". We traveled in October. So they straight up lied. A warning when checking in about the noise (really, really loud, constant honking and everything) would have been the courtesy I expected for any hotel (especially at about $250/night) but a straight up lie...disappointed. 

Otherwise I would say, great view of the Cliffside and loved hearing the waves crash. The restaurant next door was super good with great drinks, as promised by the front desk. The rooms were nice (although there was no free water and the tap wasn't very good). A little expensive compared to other beachside options that we were looking into but would have been worth it if not for the construction and straight up fib.",,,,,,,,Lulu Lawag,Guest Services / Front Office,2020-10-12,"Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your visit to our hotel.

The floors are disgusting and leave your feet black. The toilet kept malfunctioning. My husband had to fix it three times. The toilet knob is corroded and feels gross. The bathroom door doesn’t shut appropriately. There was hair on floor when we arrived and it never got cleaned in six days. There were toys under the bed that I threw out myself. The beds were never changed or even made on the two days we asked to have the room cleaned. We paid 1500.00 for a dirty, unkempt room. The trash situation is unacceptable. Guests have to empty their own trash but there is nowhere to put it. Twice we drove off property to dispose of our garbage. Not first class. This is our third and last visit. We won’t be back.

My advise to management is to not sell 124 for the same price as other rooms, it is just unfair!
Check in was a little not nice as receptionist didn’t know how to split payment and took her a while coming back and forth to figure out how to do that, and some embarrassment from our side!
Check out was smoother and quicker

Only complaint was the odd setup of the bathroom.  Not sure why someone felt a wall was necessary between the sink and the toilet, or why they put the TP roll in such an awkward spot, but it felt cramped and weird.  Other than that, it was a perfect stay.",,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,Lulu Lawag,Guest Services / Front Office,2020-09-19,"Thank you for sharing your experience with us.

The sunset was sensational and we could hear the soothing sound of the surf. It's a bit of a walk to the beach and the stairway  back up is  a workout. Our room was immaculately clean and the toiletries were first class.  The breakfast was separately wrapped packaged food but the coffee was fresh. Best of all was how nice everyone was esp the front desk staff. Caitlin gave us excellent tips on local attractions and restaurants and  Tina ably assisted us with a future reservation. We'll use it as  a half-way point between SF and LA where we can meet our adult kids.,,,,,,,,Lulu Lawag,Guest Services / Front Office,2020-09-19,"Thank you for taking the time to review your visit with us.

daniphardwicke,1,,2020-09-30,NONE,2020-09-14,2,2 stars for location of hotel,"We booked this hotel due to the high ratings from other guests but we were very dissatisfied. We came with family, each got our own rooms. 

The lobby was dirty and not welcoming, along with the lobby bathroom. 

Check-in was OK. Not super friendly or helpful, but OK.

For the price of this hotel per night, our expectations were high and we were sadly dissatisfied. The room was very basic, shower had hair in it from previous guests, and the tv cords were all unplugged. Room had some coffee and your very standard amenities.

The room was directly next to where they served breakfast so we were woken up at 6 am by loud staff talking and laughing and setting up BANGING loudly with ice, etc. nonstop until people began showing up to get food. 

Bathrooms are decent sized. 

The elevator is tiny and completely outdated and dirty. Holes in the walls.

They have awful parking situations for the amount of rooms at the hotel. Upon returning from dinner there was NO parking, we had to sit outside and wait for staff to move their car for over an hour. The hotel wasn't full, yet no parking available. 

Breakfast during COVID was OK, everything packaged up so that was a plus. There is a nice restaurant walking distance also a plus. 

all in all, for the price of this hotel, only go if the weather is really nice and you can enjoy the view because that is all you get. For 300+ a night, we won't be returning.

Suspar,41,,2020-09-30,COUPLES,2020-09-13,3,"Motel feel, hotel pricing","We stayed in a king ocean view room and the view and the sound of the surf was everything we were hoping for. But for the price, the room still feels like a motel: a little cramped, bare floors, bed skirt that doesn't fit, small bathroom, squeaky furniture, cheap motel coffee, extra charge for the water bottles in the room (tiny print at the bottom), no mini-bar. The staff is super friendly, parking is included in the room (it is a motel, after all!) and the grounds and pool area are lovely (and love the gulls!) The pre-packaged food for the breakfast is also mediocre motel quality. So all in all, it's a very nice motel, just a little disappointing in terms of price-amenities.

We had a king room which was more than enough for our us. The views from our “partial ocean/pool view” could not be beat! We did overlook the pool which was not an issue, but could be for some who have issues with pool noise/activity. The room was fitted with ample towels, which was wonderful, and extra pillows and blankets. We used the blanket on then balcony at night when the temperature dropped. 
Despite the breakfast being grab-n-go due to C19 there was hot, fresh coffee and plenty of items to choose from. There was a helpful, friendly attendant every day doing all they could for you considering the circumstances. 
Overall we were very happy and comfortable and will return post-Covid for another visit.

Adina Morano E,56,"San Ramon, California",2020-08-31,NONE,2020-08-06,5,A perfect getaway!,"We escaped our COVID environment at home and came to Shore Cliff for a few days.  The hotel sits right on a cliff overlooking the pacific.  Sunsets are amazing here as there are no other hotels obstructing the views.  
Our room faced the ocean (front) and had a nice size patio which we used every night to watch the sunset and have cocktails and snacks.  
The room itself is typical - 2 beds, fridge/coffee, etc.  the bed was comfy and sheets were very nice (to us, the sheets are dependent on how will we will sleep).  There are robes in the room - we didn't use them, but would have been nice going to/from the pool.
Overall, I would definitely stay here again and would happily recommend it.

liv2travel,91,,2020-08-31,FAMILY,2020-08-05,4,Good Choice During Covid,"My family decided to take a beach vacation before school started and also to celebrate our anniversary. We chose the Shore Cliff based on a friend’s recommendation. The hotel is designed like a motel where the doors are outside and each unit has its own air conditioner so no air is shared between rooms. There is no housekeeping but you can text them if you need anything. This is why we selected this hotel. For our anniversary they decorated a heart with towels and rose petals and gave us a bottle of sparkling cider which was really nice. Originally we were going to book a nicer hotel near the pier but I’m glad we didn’t because it was so crowded down there and honestly the downtown and pier beach area were not very nice. The best part of this hotel was our view. We had room 303 a pier view room. We had an unobstructed view of the ocean, beach and pier. I’m actually glad we didn’t pick an ocean front room because that whole side of the hotel smelled really bad due to all the birds. There is a bird sanctuary on the cliffs below the hotel and the area by the gazebo smelled so bad and had bird poop everywhere. Unfortunately there’s really nothing the hotel can do about that. Overall we had a pleasant stay and it was a good choice during covid times but this is more of a luxury motel than a hotel. If you don’t like birds and are sensitive to smells not a good choice for you. ",,,,,,,,Lulu Lawag,Guest Services / Front Office,2020-08-08,"We are so happy you chose us for your beach getaway.

Adventurer703484,4,,2020-07-31,NONE,2020-08-05,3,Awesome views but terrible beds,"The hotel location and our room location (212) were incredible and it didn't hurt that the Pelicans put on a daily show for all.  However...At check-in our clerk was very short and without warmth. 
 She did nothing to explain our stay, breakfast, the grounds, ect. Our beds were extremely worn and uncomfortable.  My back still hurts.  I called and requested additional mattress covers in hopes of improving our sleep quality which did not help.  At night we could hear and feel a very loud vibration above our bathroom that could be heard in our bedroom sharing the bathroom wall.  I believe it was a broken bathroom fan in the room above us.  When I called and requested someone take a look at the problem the clerk who answered the phone was not friendly at all and made me feel like my issue was NOT important.  The issue was never resolved.  Both my daughter and I wiped our room down prior to bringing our luggage and food up to the room due to COVID.  We were amazed at how dirty our wipes were after wiping the presumed ""clean"" room.  I was also shocked at how many people were not wearing masks in the hotel and outside on hotel property.  This was not being enforced.  Our toilet was backed up and a friendly maintenance worker came into our room to fix the toilet NOT WEARING A MASK.  I am an ER nurse and I was shocked at how cavelier staff were about enforcing mask wearing.  I would like to recognize MELODY who worked in the pool area.  She was awesome at wiping down the lounge chairs and assuring the correct number of people were in the pool area.  She is a very friendly and hard working.  If it wasn't for the fact that every morning we could hear the waves crashing and look out our slider and almost touch the water, we would have been extremely dissatisfied with our mini vacation.  We paid $2100.00 for our room and strongly feel we did NOT get what we paid for.  It's amazing what a person will settle for when presented with an incredible location.",,4.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,Lulu Lawag,Guest Services / Front Office,2020-08-08,"We are so glad you enjoyed our gorgeous ocean views.

California Girl,1,,2020-07-31,FAMILY,2020-08-03,1,DO NOT stay here!!! Covid alert!!!,"Stayed here for a weekend getaway after being assured by hotel staff that they were taking every precaution necessary during the pandemic. During my stay, we saw plenty of housekeeping staff going in and out of rooms to clean them without masks. Staff and guests alike were walking around without masks, even though the property had a sign at the lobby door saying that masks on property were required by county and state rules. Restaurant next door was also not enforcing any guidelines and customers were walking around freely without masks. Waiting staff was not wearing gloves. Beach and city were crowded with people walking around without masks. We had an miserable experience and are now having to get tested for Covid.

The room quality also left much to be desired. Felt like a travelodge or cheap motel. Views were gorgeous but not worth the Covid risk and rundown accommodations.

A Pampered Traveler,373,"Burbank, California",2020-07-31,COUPLES,2020-07-27,4,Get away during Covid,"We decided to take a long weekend to Pismo Beach for our first trip away since March. The website went through the precautions the hotel was doing to make its guests feel safe and the reviews were positive so I decided to go to the Shore Cliff. First let me say location of the room is everything here, some rooms are in busy corridors and some are not. 
My check in experience was not pleasant but that was because the room was not ready at 4. I did not get into our room until closer to 5. You see the Shore Cliff was sold out the night prior to our arrival and the whole weekend we were there. The staff was working hard and pleasant. They were wearing masks but the patrons were not. There were many a guest walking around the grounds without masks, which made me uncomfortable. The grounds were pretty and views were wonderful. We did not walk to the beach as the walk had us pass too many unmasked party goers, it was just better to go to a safer beach by car. You must walk through three other hotels and down 90 stairs to get to busy Pismo Beach. 
They great thing about this place is that the hotel was more like a motel as it had doors on outside walkways. The wall units were also usually not good but in the time of COVID, I was glad to not share a vent. The rooms were pretty sound proof and the bed was very comfortable. I really enjoyed my view from my Pier View room and had many a meal on my balcony. We were relaxed when we avoided the crowds.

traveldan21,539,"Culver City, California",2020-07-31,NONE,2020-07-19,4,Beautiful ocean front setting for a quarantine getaway,"We chose Shore Cliff for our first trip away from home during the pandemic because of its promised cleaning regimen, mask requirements, social distancing, etc. Our experience was as advertised. Everyone, staff and guests seemed to take precautions seriously and we were able to stay a couple of nights without ever feeling crowded or unsafe.

Since we were celebrating our anniversary we splurged on an oceanfront room. We requested a second floor balcony room and got one. The setting is spectacular. On a rocky bluff overlooking the ocean, with some interesting rock formations just off shore. There is a walkway that you can use to visit the Ventana Grill restaurant just to the north of the hotel, and a walkway/trail that takes you through neighboring hotels to the south and stairs down to Pismo Beach. Note that there was no elevator to the second floor in our building.

A couple of notes about the location: it is a known hang out for sea gulls and pelicans, which rest on the rocks or fly around the area, gliding on wind currents. We liked the sounds of the birds and got a kick out of watching them ride the currents. You can walk to the shops and restaurants in town on a 20-25 minute trip but other ocean front hotels are closer.

The room we had was pretty large and included a mini-fridge, microwave, writing table, sofa, bathrobes (but no slippers), and a large shower. The balcony had a couple of chairs and a table. The hotel had two spaces reserved for electric car charging, which came in handy. The breakfast was grab and go, due to COVID. Not bad, all things considered.

Pros: Great location with beautiful views. Free parking. Free Wifi. Clean pool. Nice Bath & Body Works toiletries. Good grab & go continental breakfast. Friendly front desk staff 
Cons: OVERPRICED for what you get... the rooms seem like it was a converted motel room. The carpet in the indoor hallways are lifting- both my son and I tripped several times going to our room. I'm 8 months pregnant, so it would have been an issue if I actually fell. The room carpet was DISGUSTING! My family wore our shoes in the room the entire time because the carpet was too gross to walk on barefoot. With us visiting during this COVID-19 time, I was expecting an exceptionally clean room, but to my dismay it wasn't the case. I had went around disinfecting the surfaces of the room as a personal precaution and found that it was still rather dusty and dirty. 

I wish I could have rated this place higher, but with the cleanliness issue, I just couldn't. Unfortunately I probably wouldn't be staying here again :(",,2.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,Tina Jenkins,Guest Services / Front Office,2020-07-11,"Thank you for staying with us over the the 4th of July weekend and sharing your valuable feedback.  I am pleased to hear you enjoyed the beautiful views and our friendly staff.  I am sorry to hear of the issues with the carpet , we have notified our housekeeping manager.  Our housekeeping staff as well as other staff members are taking extra measures to ensure the cleanliness of our property. I am sorry to hear that is not what you experienced.  We hope you will return another time.

Not so much","We were excited to stay here in the beginning looking at all the reviews online as well as available photos but what those photos don't tell you are all the horrors that await you once you arrive. 

To begin, the walls are about as thick as rice paper so be prepared to here everything that everyone else is doing. The wall mounted climate control units are probably about as old as the hotel is and make insanely loud operational noise making it impossible to sleep through when trying to stay comfortable. 

The mattress was about as hard as a rock. I'm pretty sure I've camped on floors softer than the mattress provided in the room.

Additionally, our particular shower drain had some nice quirks which required us to hold the drain down while showering in order for the water to .. well, drain. 

Lastly, for the an average cost of around $300 a night we've come to expect a certain level of accomodations at this price point but rest assured you're simply paying for the view. The room is sincerely outdated and you will leave more exhausted than when you arrived.

I realized that mostly it was my fault but still feel disappointed. I booked one night 05/14-05/15. After we did check in I put all my cash (about $1k) in the room safe. I forgot about it when we did check out. I came back in the evening same day. The room was already cleaned, the safe opened and of course no money. Nobody reported about it. On the front desk they tried to help but they even couldn't talk to the person who cleaned the room! They took all my information but nobody never called me.

The room was clean, comfortable and had everything we needed for my fiance, me and my 5 month old. The sunset and sunrise morning view from our bed was priceless and we’ll be staying here again without a doubt. The only downfall to us leaving early in the morning was due to people nearby smoking weed so we had to shut our doors from the beautiful view and bring my baby back inside for that reason. I’m not letting that affect my review given that this is a non-smoking hotel and some people don’t forget that their are kids and babies around.

This was an extremely wonderfully opposite experience. I don't think I've ever stayed at a hotel with such amazing customer service. The front desk was not only pleasant but extremely accommodating. Even the grounds and housekeeping staff was amazing. As an example, as we were pulling into the driveway, a large palm fell off of one of the trees. In the extremely short amount of time it took to park and get out of the car, a staff member had already driven over to dispose of it. The room was perfect. The ocean view was more than we expected. I think during this weekend there was some kind of family event that resulted in a lot of people being at the pool. We got a text message letting us know that there may be a towel shortage but that they were working on it and some would be delivered as soon as possible.

And trust me, it did. As Canadians escaping the snow, it was a spectacular sight. We chose a ""Partial and Pool View"" room that faces north and it was the perfect way to wake up. The view was incredible with the ocean, palm trees, and clear sky. The room was quite large, with a little kitchenette there if needed. Large bathroom. Balcony with chairs (though we had no time to enjoy them). There was highway traffic noise, as the hotel is right beside a busy road, but we didn't find it bothersome. Wifi seemed a bit spotty in our room, but for one night it wasn't a big deal. Breakfast was pretty basic (eggs, fruit, bread, bacon, waffles). The nicest part was the view, the walk along the coast, the gazebo overlooking the ocean...a truly spectacular view. Hopefully we'll get a chance to go back and have a bit more time to soak up the view.",Highway is very noisy so do not book a room facing it,5.0,5.0,,5.0,,,Stay47068209000,Guest Services Supervisor,2020-03-03,"Thank you for sharing your detailed 5 star review!

One concern I had was the room and view wasn’t going to be worth what I was paying as I based my decision to book this hotel on Yelp reviews alone but I was TREMENDOUSLY impressed with the hotel and the views and it was really worth every penny and the 5 hour drive we did to get here. Highly recommended because this is a true gem. Also loved the virtual assistant they have via text. I wish all hotels had that. Lastly I loved that the free breakfast was served until 10am. IF I had to say one thing that could improve it’d be that the precooked bacon was cooked a bit longer... but if that’s my biggest/only complaint, that says lots because I travel often and have pretty high standards (I’d like to think)

Pros: beautiful sweeping ocean views, great restaurant next door (Ventana Grill), short 10-15 walk to downtown, decent breakfast and free parking. Cons: our balcony overlooked the busy pool area, we were next to a stairwell/exit door that was super loud (banged non-stop). Overall I think it's a great value and would recommend this place. Just avoid room 115 if possible.",Pretty much every room has ocean views.

Check-in was very easy - our first room that they gave us appeared to have a water blockage problem. As soon as we told the lady (Sharon) at the desk, she immediately apologised and arranged for another room for us & was extremely friendly and courteous throughout this process. 

The room itself was perfect. Very clean, large & very comfortable bed, all the amenities you need. Plus the touches!! Even the toilet roll was folded and presented with such elegance and perfection! Room also came with an iron and table, safe & binoculars for seeing wildlife! 

The views were spectacular - waking up to see the ocean from the window was just incredible - and something that you can’t even get at 5* chain hotels in other parts of California. Falling asleep to the sound of the ocean was also so tranquil. 

We didn’t have the breakfast as we were in a rush to continue our road trip. 
All in all this stay was just so lovely, much more amazing than we could have expected & made our road trip so wonderful to have somewhere so comfortable and hospitable to stay. Would definitely return and unreservedly recommend. ",,,,,,,,lulul27,Front Office Manager,2020-01-26,"Thank you for your kind comments.

What I did not like was the website did not inform the person making the booking that the price now increased unless read at the final stage of booking.

The hotel advertised free breakfast, but not increase the rate, these are the types of things that I will go above and beyond to tell others as the hotel is after the money.

We host a variety of bird species that come here seasonally to mate and raise their young including Night Herons, Gulls and the California Brown Pelicans. In order to do this we have brought in additional staff to clean our balconies and wash our sidewalks and pool area frequently. We do our best to clear the property of droppings and nests as they become abandoned, however as you can see, these natural residents stay very active and are difficult to keep up with.

Would much prefer a queen or King over a full size bed for an adult couple. The suite was fabulous for two couples. A huge kitchen and huge living area makes this very comfortable. The situation of the room practically directly over the ocean is a most spectacular view ever!

luckybkr,19,"Bloomer, Wisconsin",2019-11-30,COUPLES,2019-11-13,5,Amazing views and great room layouts!,The views here are spectacular and you can watch the sunset over the ocean. The layout of our room was great (more square than a long rectangle like most) and the kitchen area has everything you need including a sink.  Love that there is extra room in the bathroom to setup my suitcase so I didn't have to keep going to get things out of it.  Our room was located on the 3rd floor overlooking the pool so there was a bit of noise but when it came time to sleep this was not an issue at all.  Great walking path goes through the property and there are steps down to the beach so don't think that you need to stay downtown to get great beach access.  Only downside is the smell from the pelicans sitting on the seaside cliffs that can be quite strong when out on the point.,,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,lulul27,Front Office Manager,2019-11-15,"I am glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay with us and you enjoyed the layout of the room.

BHN,2,,2019-09-30,NONE,2019-10-27,5,Everything you could want for a getaway in the Central Coast,"On a quick trip up the coast, we decided to “stop over” in Pismo Beach. Stayed at Shore Cliff based on reviews and a screaming deal. Loved it so much we ended up staying for the entire 4 days / 3 nights! 
Terrific staff at the front desk - very helpful and accommodating. Beautiful king size room overlooking the pool and ocean. Breakfast was included and offered a good selection. There is also a workout room and a BEAUTIFUL heated swimming pool and spa.
A public access walkway runs along the cliff and allows for lovely strolls down to the beach via some STEEP stairs (totally do-able but not for the faint hearted). There are little on-property seating areas where you can kickback and watch the antics of the resident pelicans and gulls. 
And here is where I must interject my only “warning”: there are HUNDREDS of pelicans which roost along the pedestrian path and they s-t-i-n-k!!! (My boyfriend and I renamed them “smell-icans”). That’s all part and parcel of the beach experience. But the olfactory-sensitive should be forewarned!
In short: great room, terrific staff, filling breakfast, walking distance to Pismo Pier, and close to San Simeon and Cambria. We can’t wait to go back and do it all again!",,,,,,,,lulul27,Front Office Manager,2019-10-31,"Thank you for choosing to stay with us during your travels up the central coast.

I was told there were no rooms available even though I saw availability for the same room type at cheaper rates online. After being told no, I had to take it upon myself to request an upgraded room at cost so that I can get checked in to get ready for the wedding. For a hotel that charges $350/night I was extremely disappointed. The hotel is an over glorified motel. There is no valet, no covered parking, no bell person. The beds are too firm and the air conditioner is disturbingly loud. There is also no hot water.

The only thing which could be improved is breakfast.  Like many American hotels, breakfast is poor, consisting only of sugary cereals/bread and waffles.  It would be nice to have cooked options provided - proper scrambled eggs and bacon for instance, instead of the often seen 'egg patties' made from who knows what.

MeganLouise24,265,"Gold Coast, Australia",2019-10-31,COUPLES,2019-10-06,4,Lovely comfy room ,"A really Nice hotel room and great views. Comfy bed. Although pillows were a little too big and puffy.
Great service, friendly staff. About 20 minute walk into town for cafes and shopping.
Lovely breakfast and service but unpleasant atmosphere  due to bad acoustics. It was really loud & busy.
We have stayed in 10 USA hotels on our recent trip and this is the only one that has provided real Plates, cutlery and glasses & mugs for breakfast, rather than paper plates and plastic disposal cutlery. Thank you. 
On arrival, the stench of the birds is almost unbearable. Whilst waiting to check in, I took a walk outside and although the grounds and views are lovely, I regretted our choice. Thankfully our room was around the far side, facing the south, so the smell wasn’t as bad. I smelt it in morning again, but then I didn’t smell again when I was by pool and again later that night taking a walk which was great! It must be dependent on wind direction. 
On returning from my morning walk, our room was fall of flies as we’d left the balcony door open. Thankfully I had insect repellent or I wouldn’t have been able to stay there.

Susan H,164,,2019-09-30,NONE,2019-09-30,5,Watch your dates,"This is the BEST hotel in Pismo, and I've been to them ALL.  The problem?  The rates fluctuate a lot.  This weekend they were up to the $260 area, and they quoted us $320 for next year.  NOOOOT!

There is a smell, of birds. But! There are also a lot of great pictures to be had and the birds are awesome!  So, just know you are at the beach and enjoy yourself.

However, the hotel has the best pool on the whole beach. They are meticulous. And, the views are great for ocean front, fun gazebo and areas to do yoga or just stare at the ocean.  I played in that water for over 2 hours.  It was soft, clean and not over-chlorinated.  The hot tub is just right.  We spent many hours day and night at that pool.  Highly recommend and kudos to the pool and landscaping staff. They are kind and really keep that place going.

I had the BEST TIME Sept. 2019 and I will definitely go back. Any hotel along Pismo:  watch the prices.  I'm not going if you are off the charts.  It is a wonderful place to visit, but it is still the fun, homely Pismo...  don't go Laguna on us and drive us all away!

Clean, great breakfast, and organized management.  Highly recommend if they aren't being crazy on the rates.  Also, their french toast in the morning is pretty darn good with Coffee.  NOTHING Beats the French Toast at the Spy Glass, but this was a close second and it is free with your stay.  I still went to the Spy Glass for one day!","Get ocean view, pay the extra",,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,lulul27,Front Office Manager,2019-10-03,"Thank you for taking the time to share your 5 star experience with all of us on TripAdvisor.

Very friendly welcome when we arrived. Spacious, clean and comfortable room with a fridge and microwave (we popped out to a local healthy food store and got some food to cook in our room - instead of eating out - so that we could enjoy sitting on our balcony)
Balcony gave us a beautiful view of sunset over the ocean, watching the pelicans flying around. 
After sunset we went for a swim in the heated pool, then sat in the lovely hot jacuzzi with the stars overhead until late. Wonderful.

For breakfast there's a good selection at the buffet. I had oatmeal with some nice toppings.

Before leaving we spent a while in the grounds, the pelicans are wonderful and we were reluctant to leave and wished we'd booked another night.

There was rust on the outside air conditioning units, bird feathers floating on the pool water, cob webs in the hallways and dirty walkways (spills there for days). Broken outside furniture and missing deck pads along with poor seating in the dinning area. The same service and facilities I would expect at motel 6 but I'm paying top dollar.

Hotel bed not comfortable at all, felt like the bed was old and sheets were itchy (didnt see any bugs) but the sheets definitely could have been cleaner and i did have a bite on my foot the first day and my wife had one on her stomach the next day. the room door lock looked very old and kept malfunctioning. Breakfast was very disappointing for a hotel that charged over $350 per night...nothing was fresh other than oatmeal and the coffee. Dont stay here for the breakfast you will be disappointed. Holiday Inn Express has better breakfast and is half the cost and the beds are cleaner. sadly the view wasnt worth it either (foggy the first day) not the hotels fault but basically it was nothing special...had hoped for a better experience for the price paid for the room.

Chris K,69,"London, United Kingdom",2019-08-31,FAMILY,2019-08-28,5,Loved It!,"We recently spent 3 nights at Shore Cliff as part of our 3 week California adventure (from the UK).

We had a 'Two Queen Beds Ocean Front' room, and booked directly with the hotel which had the best rate when we looked. The room was great for 2 adults and 2 kids (13 and 11) and had everything we needed, including a small patio facing the ocean.

The breakfast that was included had everything we needed including almond milk for our son who is allergic to dairy. While the breakfast room can get busy, you can take a tray back to your room if you don't want to wait for a table. Plenty of free parking was provided, and we parked directly outside our room.

The hotel is positioned at the end of the beach, about 1 mile / 20 minute walk from the pier and the beach can be accessed via a walkway that joins a number of hotels on this part of the cliffs (I think this might be new).

Going via the road into town, it was about a 15 minute walk to the main part of town.

The hotel is home to a lot of bird life, and they provided small binoculars in our room, which was a nice touch. As well as all the birds, we also saw dolphins and a number of whales during our stay which was quite amazing.

The pool is more than large enough and nice and warm, and apart from one day where we had to wait for towels, it was the perfect place to spend the afternoon. The whirlpool tub is even warmer and great for the chilly mornings before the sea mist cleared.

My son enjoyed his 14th birthday while we were in Pismo, and we all agreed that it was one of the favourite parts of our trip. We would not hesitate to recommend this hotel.",,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,lulul27,Front Office Manager,2019-08-30,"I appreciate your positive feedback about our hotel.

Angela,116,"Lincoln, United Kingdom",2019-08-31,FAMILY,2019-08-20,5,Amazing vuews,"Omg if you need a hotel in Pismo beach this is a must. Beautiful views off the sea we are on the 3 rd floor and all I can say is wow.

We have been whale watching today from our balcony, they even supply you with binoculars. We have seen quiet a few whales, it’s such a amazing experience to see. 

Rooms are a very good size we are a family of 4 (2 x adults & 2 children 12 & 10)

Would definitely recommend this hotel and would definitely return again in the future.

And it has free parking

Anna L,19,,2019-08-31,FAMILY,2019-08-19,3,Nice location,"We love the location and the ocean view. The only thing that I wasn't aware was the pelicans and seagulls on the cliff. We couldn't enjoy our balcony because of the birds pooping everywhere and coming to the balconies to get food. The 💩 was so offensive but I don't know if it smells like that everyday or some times. There is a path that connects to some other hotels after the little bridge and have their own steps to go down to the beach. That side didn't smell bad. We definitely enjoy the pool and the Jacuzzi.
Breakfast was included. It was decent but people get very impatient to get their food. Staff were very courteous and friendly. The room looked nice except for under the beds...need to vacuum more often.",,,,,,,,lulul27,Front Office Manager,2019-08-22,"Thank you for taking the time to review your stay with us.

The only thing that bothered us was the smell of the birds, a foul smell like rotten fish. Of course I don’t blame it with the hotel staff and management because it’s beyond their control but at least if they are honest enough to tell us so we could choose another room. Lesson learned the hard way. I requested the front desk to have our bedsheets changed and I’m glad that housekeeping was notified right away though I might be wrong but the bedsheets looks so crumpled that it looks like someone has slept on it, it could had been stretched to look tidy.

wkmoon,283,,2019-08-31,NONE,2019-08-16,3,When I compare it....,"I write a lot of reviews and I read a lot of reviews, but I will admit that I was stressed out planning our trip and I did not read reviews for Pismo Beach properties; I simply scrolled TA and checked rates and availability on the top 10 rated venues... Therefore I missed the comments regarding the birds! Therefore I was taken by surprise when we arrived and exited our car.  The odor is quite strong.  I do think that the management is sincerely trying to keep up with the birds and their droppings; we saw people scrubbing down rails, etc each day, but it's  a bit of a losing battle, I am afraid.  

Anyway on to the other things.  We stayed at 3 different places along the CA coast on this trip and although each was a very different property, we paid about the same amount.  ShoreCliff was in my thoughts, the least bang for the buck.  It really is a motel, not a hotel.  We drove up to our door.  The beds were not comfortable.  Yes the rooms are recently renovated and I did appreciate the vinyl tile flooring because I know that it stands a better chance of being cleaned than carpet, but the walls were thin, especially because we had a room that had an adjoining door.  I felt like the neighbor was holding a conversation on my bed.  The ceiling was thin too or perhaps we had elephants upstairs our first night.  I almost wonder if they stacked a double/double room of 4+ people on top of a kIng room, and if so, does that make sense?  I know the area and know that mornings tend to be foggy but if you are pondering an ocean front room, just think about the time of day that you plan to actually be in your room to enjoy the view and if that time is morning, you might want to save some money.  

The pool is definitely larger than the pools of the next two properties that you can walk past as you take the ocean side path to the beach, but the afternoon we visited there were no fresh towels and there were bird droppings and around the pool deck.  For me, the water was not warm enough to get into either.  Then came the guests who started throwing things into the pool from their balcony and it seemed like perhaps they had quite a few people occupying one room.  

The breakfasts were typical chain fare with a lot of guests coming in and not quite enough seats, depending on the time of visit.

Although the check-in staff was friendly, they did not explain the new walking path that takes you to a beach access.  All you have to do is keep walking along the ocean side pathway, cross a bridge, walk in front of 3 other hotels and get to a beach access.  That's good information to share!  It's a a much quieter more secluded beach area than what you get if you drive into Pismo-proper. 

I have family in the area, so we will be back to visit every 2 years or so, but I am pretty sure that we will try out a different property the next time. I can't see where this property should cost more than the ones next to it...",,2.0,3.0,3.0,,,,lulul27,Front Office Manager,2019-08-18,"Thank you for taking the time to share your review with all of us on TripAdvisor.

Sandra R,16,"Angwin, California",2019-08-31,COUPLES,2019-08-15,4,Lovely and Restful,"We just departed from the Shore Cliff Hotel after a 3 night stay. We had an overall lovely experience. Pros: location, virtual assistant (front desk that you could text), kind staff, large clean rooms that have been updated with robes, binoculars, microwave and refrigerator. The pool was very nice with a spa, large towels provided. The breakfast was very good which included fresh whole fruit, yogurt and fruit, boiled eggs, cereal, milk, OJ, almond milk on request, wonderful fresh made oatmeal with toppings, eggs, breakfast meats, pastries, toast, English muffins, and French toast in addition to coffee and tea. Cons: horrible WIFI in the building overlooking the pool, not so great mattress (king room partial ocean view over he pool). To the hotels credit, I didn’t report the issues with the mattress until checkout. The WIFi was reported and didn’t improve. The front desk gave me a discount upon checkout without me requesting it. What I wish I had known? That the fog can settle on Pismo beach for days at a time which negates any view. I went to this hotel knowing about the birds nesting and we were fine. Our room was a King room overlooking the pool on the second floor. It was noisy at times from the pool making it difficult to hear the ocean and the glass barrier around the pool decreases visibility.  I guess this is the reason it is considered a partial ocean view. Do I believe it is over priced? Yes! It averaged at about $220 a night. Too much for the area and room. Granted this is the going rate in town. ",,,,,,,,lulul27,Front Office Manager,2019-08-17,"Thank you for taking the time to write a review, we appreciate your feedback.

The location was great for our journey between SF and L.A. The hotel has pelicans nesting on the cliffs surrounding the hotel which is lovely for the views but it makes the area smelly. 

Our room was spacious it the air conditioning was really loud so we couldn’t use it because of the noise it made. The hotel offered us an alternative room  instead but seeing as we were only staying one night and had already unpacked we did not take it. They offered us a fan too. 

Overnight we discovered the toilet cistern was broken as it kept filling up every 20 minutes. We reported it to reception the next day saying it kept us awake along with the lack of air conditioning but they just apologised.

FloydPearl,1,,2019-08-31,FAMILY,2019-08-13,2,Disappointing,"I rarely ever post any reviews but this experience is not pleasant at all. I'm writing this from the room of the hotel.
Pros: location is good, the view is probably nice, can't see much due to a heavy fog, front desk nice and accommodating. The pros stop here. 
Cons: the smell around the property is horrible. It's a nesting season and the amount of seagulls and pelicans around the property contribute to a nasty smell. I know not the hotel's fault but due to the smell and grounds not being so clean you can't spend much time outside. We walked to the properties next door just to get some fresh air. 
Rooms are spacious, decency clean but oh boy, so basic! Not even sure how this is called a hotel, your typical motel. 
Grounds are basic, no firepits unlike every other property next door.
Haven't tried the breakfast yet but walked into the area where it's normally served and it stinks! Not clean...
Internet: non existent! Called the front desk, they supposedly restarted the router then gave a lame excuse of, too many guests at the property, router is not catching up. Really??? I travel a lot, and stay at hotels with thousands and thousands of rooms and for some reason the routers at other places always catch up with the amount of guests. So yeah, that's not the excuse you give to your guests. 
Price : overpriced for what you get! This is a motel , it is not worth over 250 per night! Wish I did a better research and booked Seacrest right next door, which looks hundred times nicer. So please do yourself a favor and book elsewhere! Wish I did...",,,,,,,,lulul27,Front Office Manager,2019-08-16,"Thank you for taking the time to review your recent stay with us.

Our property offers amazing cliff side views of the ocean and the natural wildlife that abounds on the coast. We host a variety of bird species that come here seasonally to mate and raise their young including Night Herons, Gulls and the California Brown Pelicans. In order to do this we have brought in additional staff to clean our balconies and wash our sidewalks and pool area frequently. We do our best to clear the property of droppings and nests as they become abandoned, however as you can see, these natural residents stay very active and are difficult to keep up with. Additionally, we hire experts to clean the rooftops as well. We love our feathered friends, but they certainly keep us busy!

The room is lovely with an amazing view of the ocean and Pismo Beach Pier for viewing the Fireworks.

As soon as we got out of the car, we could smell that clean ocean air. Our room was a partial ocean view facing the pool and indeed the ocean. We could see water spouts from the whales in the distance. The pool was warm, clean, and not crowded. The room was clean, roomy, and comfortable. The breakfast was a little crowded, but we all found something to enjoy, which is always hard (a vegetarian, a meat eater, a teenager, and a 7 year old) We would take our trays to the little eating bars right outside. My daughter and I lounged on the patio swings and my son and I walked over to the nearby hotels and down to the ocean (you walk over to cottage inn by the sea and from there you walk to the seacrest) We will definitely be booking here again.",,,5.0,5.0,,5.0,,lulul27,Front Office Manager,2019-07-04,"Thank you for taking the time to provide us with your valuable feedback.

Canucks301,189,"Vancouver, Canada",2019-06-30,COUPLES,2019-06-28,5,Love this place,"Stayed at Pismo Beach overnight during my PCH/Highway 1 road trip. The location of Shore Cliff Hotel is perfect, and I am glad that I have reserved an ocean view room where in the evening me and my wife just chilled at the balcony watching the ocean and the seagulls. Unfortunately the weather was cloudy so not managed to see a wonderful sunset. As for the hotel it has 2 story without elevator so if you are on the 2nd floor you need to carry your luggage up the stairs. Staff at the reception were very nice and helpful. The room is spacious the bed maybe just a touch on the soft side but overall me and my wife really loved the place. There are also 2 gliders in the courtyard facing the sea and yoga classes in the courtyard as well. Would definitely come back and stay a few more nights in the future.",,4.0,5.0,,5.0,,,lulul27,Front Office Manager,2019-07-03,"Thank you for taking the time to give us your feedback.

All rooms have a great view. Why come to the ocean if you aren't going to sit and enjoy it? There are also numerous seating areas with gliders, etc for you to relax outside of your room. The pool is huge and again, with a fabulous view. The breakfast is better than continental, although we often take advantage of nearby restaurants. If you can get a room with a pier view (hard to get), it is worth the extra price if you like people watching from your balcony. There are often surfers and people flying kites on the beach below and it's fun to watch. If you don't get a room on that side, there are plenty of chairs and gliders there to enjoy the view.

MalissaC26,165,"Twain Harte, California",2019-05-31,COUPLES,2019-06-04,4,Very nice hotel,"We would have given this hotel 5 ⭐️ ‘s & more but...the construction going on was a little annoying. We did received a courtesy call about the construction but.. it was the night before our arrival so, too late. The website did say construction was ending in March so didn’t think twice about it because we were going in early May. With that I will say that was the only negative we encountered. We had very loud neighbors on the 2nd night screaming & yelling late into the night we were only annoyed because we knew construction was starting b4 7 AM & it did start at 6:30AM 🙁 but the room was amazing!! The views were spectacular. We loved doing coffee & breakfast out on our balcony every morning. The had really great coffee too! Seattle’s Best (Watch out for seagulls that will snatch up your food)The free continental breakfast was like no other we have had for free!! Real eggs made a different way every morning , real oatmeal, real bacon, toast, muffins & much more , did I say Real!! Very good plenty of choices including fruit. At 4:00 PM fresh baked cookies, however we never made it down at that time. We got to sleep with our balcony door open & listen to the waves crashing, truly an amazing place & experience!This was our 1st time trying this hotel out & we were very pleased. I will say it is pricey but  worth every penny & booking directly with the hotel saved us over $100.00 instead of going through Booking.com. The room had a great comfy bed, nice linings, robes, good towels & higher quality toiletries. Plenty of hot water,  great decor & very nice pictures on the walls beautiful colors, it had a great shower head & we’d like to especially thank Laura our maid for cleaning so well & showing pride in her job.No finger prints, no dust, no spider webs, no hair on the bathroom floor. Very much appreciated the time & care taken to clean the room. We definitely appreciated our stay at this hotel, we come to Pismo yearly for our Anniversary 32 years & counting but this time was for my early retirement. Staff was friendly & courteous & like I said before if there wasn’t construction going on it would have been a 5+ star hotel for sure. We will definitely recommend this hotel to family, friends & anyone who asks for recommendations.

Clete,289,"Redlands, California",2019-05-31,COUPLES,2019-05-31,4,"Nice, but not without issues","We stayed 4 nights at the Shore cliff while attending a family celebration in Pismo Beach. We arrived a bit early and tried to check in. The clerk said the room was not ready but should be soon and that she would call me when it was available. I'm still waiting for that call. The hotel is well located and easy to get to. It is a short drive into Pismo or shell beach. The buildings have all been renovated. The furniture in our room did look a bit outdated and one drawer on the desk would not stay closed. Parking is free but somewhat limited (we left for home late on our last night instead of in the morning as we could not find a parking spot anywhere in the lot). All the staff (phone, front desk,  breakfast staff and maintenance) were friendly and helpful. We had a ocean front room and it was great to hear the surf all night.  The bed was comfortable with good quality bedding.  The breakfast was somewhat of a mixed bag. The first morning the selection was very limited and we ended up each with one small muffin (only 4 left). The next day the room was so crowded there was no place to sit so we went downtown.  The third morning was a Saturday and while the room was crowded, we found a place to sit and enjoyed an excellent selection that included eggs, bacon, French toast, great coffee and OJ.  The staff worked very hard at ensuring food was replenished and that tables were cleared.",Ocean View,,5.0,,4.0,3.0,,lulul27,Front Office Manager,2019-06-02,"Thank you for sharing your detailed review about your visit to our property.

We had room 317, which is a pool view room, but it still had an awesome view of the ocean! Plus, it is a short drive to downtown.

It was a nice touch and made us feel special. All the staff were helpful and friendly and I would like to recognize Katie at the front desk: She was so kind, knowledgeable and professional!

Smoggylad123,113,"Middlesbrough, United Kingdom",2019-03-31,FRIENDS,2019-05-05,4,Great location.............but,We stayed here for a couple of nights in March. The location is excellent right on the Cliff Top overlooking the Ocean. We had a 'Part Ocean View Room' and that's exactly what it was (rather disappointing) as we were on the Ground Floor and we were overlooking the Fence that hid the Bins from around the Pool. The pool area is lovely but the flies were an absolute nightmare and we gave up trying to sit around the pool after about 30 minutes. The Hotel is within walking distance of Pismo Beach which again is lovely for a stroll around with some nice Bars etc. Our ground floor room which was very nicely furnished and spotlessly clean but was very noisy as the guests upstairs seemed to be walking around with diving boots on until the early hours. The included Breakfast was very nice though.,Ask for an upper floor room,,4.0,2.0,,5.0,,lulul27,Front Office Manager,2019-05-08,"Thank you for your review.

Anita W,52,"Orcutt, California",2019-03-31,COUPLES,2019-04-28,1,Birthday Bummer!!,"I will NEVER BOOK HERE again -- Terrible experience at Shore Cliff Hotel. Poor treatment from female Manager when trying to check in, the staff was unhelpful and seemed to not care about arriving guests (even though it was my birthday). Some rooms have nice views; but there is a terrible bird poop smell near that location and all around the hotel, not to mention the construction!! Booked an ocean view room (4 months in advance) for a special occasion, but upon arrival was offered an ADA room with no view, next to the very loud public breakfast kitchen!! Left this hotel after the female Manager became rude. Ended up having a fabulous stay down south a bit, at The Cliffs Hotel - I explained how it was my birthday and The Cliffs Hotel upgraded us!! Do yourself a favor, for professional staff and service, beautiful landscaping, elegant decor and a much cleaner, better all around property; book at The Cliffs Hotel - where the staff is hospitable, not hostile!",,,1.0,1.0,4.0,,,,,,,45

MrsD,45,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",2019-04-30,FAMILY,2019-04-24,4,Lovely views and super pool,"This was a lovely stay in a modern hotel. Room was very well appointed with fridge also included. Bed comfortable and accommodated a pack and play for our 2 year old. The pool is fantastic and was really warm. Wish we could have enjoyed it for longer! The view from the hotel down to Pismo is beautiful and it’s about a 5 minute drive down to the main pier area of the town, maybe a 30 min walk. Our room looked out into an area of building work which there was a note about at check in desk. They are building a bridge to extend the cliff top path. The cynic in me wondered if we were out in one of the rooms facing the works because we booked through a 3rd party website but who knows. It didn’t disturb us anyway, just meant we had to walk right up to the fence to get the nice view rather than direct from out room. 

Breakfast was busy but decent. Gluten free rice chex available in separated sealed plastic tubs which was great.

The_Mammoth31,2,,2019-04-30,COUPLES,2019-04-18,4,Unbelievable views. Decent rooms.,"The view from this hotel is unparalleled. If I could give stars for the view alone, I'd give it 5 stars twice. 

Room is clean and in good shape, for the most part. AC unit is just cut into the wall and not sealed in any way. Water, air, and bugs can enter the room under the wall unit.

Unfortunately the WiFi is absolutely useless. If it works at all, it's slower than dial up speeds. I was getting about 0.05 Mbps. That is inexcusably slow and unusable for anything. 

Front desk is slow, but friendly. You will need to have your car license plate ready, FYI.

Travels With My HP,259,"High Wycombe, United Kingdom",2019-02-28,COUPLES,2019-04-01,4,Seafront location,"We stayed here for 1 night on a recent rip down the Pacific coast. The hotel is located on a cliff above the Pacific Ocean and about 20 minutes walk along the beach (or via road) to the centre of Pismo and the pier.

Check-in was friendly and efficient and we were soon in our good sized room looking directly out to sea. Sunset from the balcony was spectacular and well worth paying a little extra for the ocean view rooms. The bed was large and comfortable and the room contained tea & coffee making facilities, a safe and decent wi-fi. The aircon unit was a bit noisy and not particularly good seeming to blow a bit hot & cold. The bathroom felt a little tired and could probably do with a bit of a facelift.

Breakfast was included and was a pretty average motel style affair where HP sauce was useful to cover up the taste of the rubbery eggs.

Although the hotel doesn't have it's own restaurant the Ventana Grill next door is popular and served good food. It's also possible to purchase a limited range of beer or wine at the hotel reception.

Overall the hotel is good value for money but would probably be better off improving the quality of the breakfast and making it an optional extra.",Pay the extra for a full sea view.,,4.0,,,4.0,4.0,lulul27,Front Office Manager,2019-04-06,"Thank you for choosing to stay with us during your travels down the central coast.

We decided to make a change this time and try going North.   Our reservation fell through at another property and we scrambled to find a place during  spring break week.   We saw this place and the pictures of the exterior of the hotel made us a little sceptical.   Upon arrival, the lobby was fantastic, staff personable and knowledgeable, room decor very good and comfortable.   We love the beach and the view that this property offers has got to be impossible to beat.   We have had amazing views in the past but this was breathtaking.   

The town is great, good food close by.  The only drawback is no beach access.  This is probably taken care of by now since they were working on it during our stay.

We were lucky enough to get a room through a cancellation, although the front desk did warn us that there was construction going on on our side of the hotel.  However, since it was a Saturday night, there was no construction that we needed to worry about (over the weekend).

The stay was adequate enough.  Felt very much like a motel, but we just needed a bed for the night, so accommodations were fine.

Pros:  Check-in fast and courteous; room faced the ocean, so a very nice view from balcony that had comfortable tall deck stools; no construction noise on weekend; large bathroom with double sinks; good shower; microwave & mini fridge; comp breakfast.

Cons:  Noise level comparable to a low budget motel; constant walking and rolling of luggage and carts on common outdoor walkway; constant foot traffic above our room; breakfast is very basic and some selections would run out quickly due to families hogging the supplies; breakfast area had double tall ceilings which only amplified the noise from breakfast service; elevator is used by both maintenance and guests; elevator can only accommodate one luggage cart and two passengers; rooms on left side of property overlook construction.","Currently, rooms on left side of property will overlook the construction.",,,,,,,lulul27,Front Office Manager,2019-03-10,"We appreciate you for taking the time to share your detailed experience with all of us.

hawaiiinourhearts,1,,2019-01-31,FAMILY,2019-01-08,5,The Oceanfront Family Suite is AMAZING!!,"We've stayed on the Central Coast about 16 times, and the oceanfront family suite at the Shore Cliff was by far our favorite accommodation (aside from an oceanfront house with private stairs to the beach, because how can you beat that?;). The suite was huge ~ it felt like an apartment rather than a hotel room ~ and so comfortable. The decor was lovely, and we used every inch of the space, from the kitchen to the lanais to the cozy reading chairs in the living room. The view from the living room was primarily pool, with the ocean beyond it, but the view from the bedrooms was breathtaking ~ *directly* over the ocean, at the edge of the bluff, but far enough from penguin rock that the scent wasn't noticeable. ;) I cracked the sliding door in my bedroom and so that I could listen to the crashing surf all night, and it was divine. We've stayed at many other hotels along the bluffs in Pismo and Shell Beach, and to my mind the oceanfront family suite at the Shore Cliff was by far the best value for money. It was so nice to have room to spread out, a space to share meals, 2 private bedrooms, and separate bathroom areas, so that someone could be showering while another person was brushing their teeth. Highly, highly recommend!!",,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,FunInSunPismoBeach,Front Office Manager,2019-01-12,"Thank you for sharing your detailed 5 star experience with the world.

Jodi V,6,"Burbank, California",2019-01-31,FAMILY,2019-01-04,2,Call ahead concerning construction,"We have been staying at this hotel for years now. It is in a stunning location with views that cannot be beat. I'm writing this review to warn people about asking very detailed questions about ongoing construction at the site BEFORE YOU BOOK. We had an issue 3 years ago and had to be partially refunded for our stay and we just experienced the same problem this weekend. As you can see from the photo our room and several others are impacted by the building of a pedestrian path.

We paid over 350$ a night and were woken up both mornings at 7am by jack hammers and air compressors. On the second day they offered to move us further way from the construction only because they had an unexpected opening. The room was inferior so we declined. They sent a bottle of champagne and a $100.00 discount. Not good enough.

Here is my biggest issue. The rooms facing the construction should not be currently bookable. I spoke to several guests who could not believe they weren't warned about the construction issue. I was actually mislead on the phone before we came and told that the workers were on ""break"" and the enormous crane was ""not on hotel property."" The crane is on their sister property and the construction is absolutely on the Shorecliff Inn property. No one was on break...it was full-on, all-day construction beginning at 7am.

Please make sure you call the (805) phone number and make them tell you the truth about construction. It's a massive operation and it's ongoing. When construction is not occurring, it's a great hotel. I'm disappointed with the management allowing people to book rooms looking into a construction zone and not telling the truth about it's extent. Call them first and find out where your room will be located. Don't book the extremely expensive family suites facing the pier. That is where we were and it will not be an experience you'll want.",,3.0,3.0,,5.0,,,FunInSunPismoBeach,Front Office Manager,2019-01-11,"We appreciate you taking the time to provide us with such candid feedback of your stay.  I am very sorry to hear that your stay did not meet expectations.  Also, I apologize you were not informed about the construction being done on our property.  When you book directly to the hotel our staff inform guests' about the upcoming pedestrian bridge, which will give our guests' direct access to Pismo Beach.  We have information about the construction located on our website and on the bottom of your emailed confirmation.  If we have a contact phone number we also do courtesy calls 3 days prior to arrival reminding guests about the construction work.

OUr plan was to reach the hotel before sunset and enjoy it from the deck of our ocean view room. Unfortunately we came in late, but no worries, we enjoyed the sunrise which was as spectacular. The ocean view room was fantastic. The room was quite large and luxurious. The service is great. I was given a choice of a room downstairs or on the first floor - I said I have a big suitcase, so I would prefer the ground level room as there are no elevators. The nice lady at the lobby said she can send someone to help with the luggage and I don't have to worry about it. She put me in the room on the first floor 'cos she said the view from there is better :) The breakfast was great - an assortment of hot and cold freshly prepared food. The hot chocolate and coffee in the lobby was definitely a plus.

We had no heat, no ability to finish heating dinner in the microwave, no tv, no internet, no pool access.  We waited an hour, then checked out as our young kids were scared and overnight temperatures were slated to be in the 30s.  Shore Cliff refused to credit us for the night we weren't staying at the hotel.  When we called to follow up the next day, the front desk manager said she couldn't authorize a refund because it ""wasn't their fault"" and offered us a ""more than generous"" half-off the night we didn't stay.  I said that wasn't an acceptable response, especially when for a $300/night hotel, and they HUNG UP ON ME.  I've never experienced such dismissive and disrespectful service.  I'm appalled, and could not recommend this hotel based on this experience.

Just walk into your room at sunset and everything (as the novelist puts it) is illuminated! To let you have that coastal sweep of scenery, the owners have invested millions in shoring up their cliff, linking it with the coastal trail and beautifying their gardens. The rooms are lovely, too, with comfy beds, hot showers, and a heat/AC system that does exactly and only what’s needed: so rare in hotels! Breakfast on crockery with steel flatware, and a fine breakfast, too. Even had Weather on, instead of News: much more of interest to travelers and nicer for everyone.

This was our family's first time to Pismo Beach (traveling with 2 kids, 8 year old and 4 year old). We booked the Family Suite and LOVED it. It was so spacious, cozy, clean and relaxing. Felt as if it was our home away from home. Location is great. Just a short drive to the pier and restaurants. We had dinner at the restaurant next door, Ventana Grill, and that was amazing as well. Hotel staff is very friendly. The few times I called prior to our stay I spoke to Tina and she was so nice and helpful. Anthony checked us in the day of our arrival and he was great as well. Our kids loved the heated pool. Everything was amazing throughout our stay and we will definitely return again.

The room had lots of space and the view from our balcony was amazing. Overall the beds were comfortable and the room was clean. Only problem I had is the towels were hanging above the toilet. There was plenty of room to hang them somewhere else so I’m not sure why they hang above and around the toilet.
The complimentary breakfast was good but in the breakfast room there is not enough seating for everyone. I’m not sure if we went at a particularly busy time or if that is how it always is. 
The surrounding grounds were well maintained and offered a stunning view. 
Great wifi and free parking. Also liked the binoculars in the room and information of the surrounding area.

Every interaction with staff was very pleasant and helpful. The walk along the cliff was the best feature - spent quite some time watching the hundreds of pelicans roosting there. The pelicans were probably the cause of the one negative - sitting by the pool was impossible because of all the flies (the pool itself was very inviting and comfortable even in early November).

Very beautiful, scenic and romantic.  Had a wonderful ocean front room on the second floor and it provided the best views ever.  Yes, as previously mentioned you may experience some smells from our sea friends, but considering the beauty of the area, all is good.

The gentleman that checked us in was extremely friendly and gave us a good rundown of the property and area. Really appreciated that.  Husband used the pool and said it was great.  The complimentary breakfast is pretty standard, but the room is very small and crowded.   Cannot imagine what it is like during the very busy summer months.  They may consider a larger room or a better lay-out.

Adjacent to the hotel is construction that is on-going to build a walking bridge taking you to a sister property and then onto the Pismo pier area.   Great addition to this property for people that like to walk into the downtown area.  

Felt like this hotel provided a few extras and cared about the comfort of their guests and I would not hesitate to stay there again.","Second floor, ocean front rooms provide the best views",4.0,5.0,5.0,,,,FunInSunPismoBeach,Front Office Manager,2018-10-30,"Thank you for choosing to stay at our hotel.

Douglas R,200,"Denver, Colorado",2018-10-31,SOLO,2018-10-26,4,Should have stayed 2 days and more,"Nice hotel perched high on a cliff facing the ocean.  Close enough on the Pier View side to hear the waves and in October was cool enough to leave the window open all nights.  Note it does have AC which would be handy in the summer.

Stayed one night and arrived late so only was able to enjoy the great view and grounds briefly in the morning.  The pool is quite nice and heated with a hot tub and glass walls to protect from winds etc.  It was very peaceful and pleasant and would have been nice to enjoy the pleasant grounds longer.  

Only complaint is they need to back off on the environmental stuff.   I get it, ""save the planet"" bla bla bla.... but with the usual parade of things around the room telling you to wash nothing or the earth will die, they also do not provide wine or glasses in the room, suggesting it will destroy the earth with the additional washing needed for them.   Glasses are available by request if you go down to the lobby - but I felt it was a step too far and after a long drive down big sur - it was annoying to open a bottle of wine and then drink from paper or trudge down to the lobby for a proper glass.  

Otherwise great place in a nice location and while you can't walk directly to the beach from the cliff, its a short drive or walk to get there in this otherwise charming location.  Next time I'll stay longer and get wine glasses when I check in.",get a Pier or Ocean View  - its very pleasant if you plan to sit on the balcony,,4.0,,5.0,,4.0,FunInSunPismoBeach,Front Office Manager,2018-10-30,"Thank you for taking the time to share your review of your visit to our hotel.

The front desk was friendly and welcoming and handled what little requests we had. The free breakfast had a bit of everything from eggs and bacon to french toast and yogurt and oatmeal. The property was right up against the cliffs and provided amazing views of the ocean and the pier, depending which room you were in. 

They don't have onsite dining aside from breakfast however the hotel is a minute walk over to Ventana Grill Restaurant that also has some amazing views, and they food isn't bad either.  The hotel also provides a concierge via texts and even alerts you if there are Whale Sightings, which there was on our last morning!! SO AMAZING TO SEE. and our room provided binoculars to view the whales swimming along the coast. it was MAGICAL. Our King size oceanfront room was plenty big and clean and comfy and we left the balcony door open all day and all night to listen to the crashing waves... it felt like a dream.

I also had a prenatal massage with Vanessa of Intuitive Massage Therapy - I found her on Yelp and she came to my room and provided a super relaxing experience.

Upon check in they offer cookies. The peanut butter cookies were delicious. The staff seemed super friendly and was very informative. Once you check in you get a text from the Hotel. You can text the hotel back to ask questions on what to do, questions/ request during your stay, check out and etc. It was a neat feature. We even scored a $10 credit through the text service for skipping room service. We booked a king pier view room. Our room was clean and very spacious. Bed was comfortable and view was absolutely amazing. The only slight issue we had during our stay was the doors were hard to open and shut. We felt like had the slam the door shut to close the door and forcefully push the door open to open the door. We felt like we were being too loud because of the door. Nothing major though. The property is well maintained with many things to do on site. There was ton of wildlife to see. It was cool to see all the pelicans and seagulls on the cliff. They also offer a really great continental breakfast! They had bagels, bacon, sausage, oatmeal, cereal, egg omelets, french toast, orange juice, coffee and so much more! It was delicious.

The rooms are nice and modern, ours was very big but I paid for a view and mostly got a view of the bushes so that was disappointing. The grounds would be nice if it weren't for the hundreds of seagulls that call the cliff in front of the hotel home. I know the hotel can't control where these birds are nesting but it really impacted our stay.

Craig M,3,"Manchester, United Kingdom",2018-10-31,COUPLES,2018-10-06,5,Great value hotel with stunning views of the ocean (We saw whales!),"We stayed here as a stop off on our way from LA to Big Sur / Monterey and couldn't be more pleased with our choice. For good value price the rooms all have views of the ocean, there is a heated pool and Jacuzzi available and self serve breakfast was adequate to get your energy for the day ahead. They provide binoculars in each room and two info sheets to tell you what wildlife to look out for - we weren't here for very long but managed to see humpback whales splashing around in the ocean, a truly magical sight. The staff are excellent and really deserve special mention. Our room was on the ground floor but large, comfortable and very well maintained. After a long drive my wife and I wanted to relax at the hotel bar but there isn't one although there is a bar restaurant next door and a few decent looking places a short walk up towards shell beach area (I would head this way as opposed to pismo area).The only downsides worth mentioning are as follows:1. The smell from the hundreds of pelicans living on the cliff face right next to the hotel. Nothing the staff can do about that and comes with the territory of such a great cliffside location but it did make the idea of a day by the pool less enticing2. The bottle of water in the room was $5 - there is a vending machine on site but you need to have the right change ($1 or  $5 bills) and it has to be stocked. With no bar on site and not within walking distance of a convenience store, charging so much for water seemed unreasonableNeither of which put me off giving Shore Cliff a 5 star review - it catered for everything we needed and is ideally located just off the 101 highway. If you're interested in wildlife I would highly recommend as well as driving up the Pacific highway around 30 miles to view the elephant seals!",,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,,,,,3

Such I lovely view from the rooms! We stayed just 2 nights but I wish it had been longer.We got smart the second night and left the patio door open to hear the ocean. Boy did that make a difference! Lulled me right to sleep. Ok can we talk about the breakfast ?! What a smorgasbord! OOWEE they had a pancake machine, fresh oatmeal, and tons of toppings, yogurt, breads, danishes, cereals, fruit, everything you could want!  and it was delicious! the staff is incredible as well. So  friendly and helpful. ANd they had freshly baked white chocolate macadamia nut cookies in the lobby every day. They had sweatshirts you can buy and games to play . And the swings outside. So romantic. The one gazebo in the picture was not accessible due to repairs  but would be a lovely wedding venue I would love to use someday. They were under new management and were buying up other adjacent properties so they could link them up and make better pathways to the beach. So easy to find and convenient location too. Oh and they had the neatest concierge system that goes on your phone to help you. pretty cool. Would love to return again soon.",Pier view is nice but does not have the sunset,,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,,,,,0
misterzee2015,4,California,2017-12-31,NONE,2018-10-02,5,Great hotel with a great location at a great price (do you see a theme there?)!,"We stayed at Shore Cliff in December 2017, escaping the fires and bad air in Santa Barbara. I didn't have too much time to research this hotel, but I took a gamble and I was very happy with my choice. The reception is large and accommodating, with snacks and drinks, and you can check out board games for the evening. The room was very comfortable and clean with everything working the way it should. There is a courtyard with a bocce ball strip and other games. There is a large and well-maintained pool and hot-tub too (which were just fine to use in December). A breakfast buffet was included which was adequate, but nothing to write home about. They were doing some work on parts of the hotel, but it was all very non-intrusive. Pismo is a quiet and charming community with some great restaurants (there's one such fine place right next door to the hotel). We were there for 4 days with our 2 young children and had a fun and relaxing time. The room rates are not the lowest you can find in this area, but are extremely reasonable for what you get.

In brief: I highly recommend this hotel and would gladly go there again.

She was in a cast and on a ""Kneelie.""  The plan was to get a place where we could just chill and enjoy ocean breezes and the sound of the surf.  We stayed in one of the family suites - a little more pricey, but worth every penny.  We could see up the coast toward the pier from the living room, and both bedroom sliders opened to a balcony just over the cliffs and the ocean.  Spectacular.  The sunset through the palm trees from the balcony was not to be missed.  It just couldn't have been better.  Well, maybe if the TVs (three in all) were smart TVs, but why be petty!  And a note to others, it was not easy for my friend to navigate the ""kneelie"" in the bathroom.  Kind of narrow.  Marina, in the breakfast room, was awesome.  Very friendly and attentive, making sure everyone was happy.

Mardi Y,4,,2018-09-30,COUPLES,2018-09-18,5,"Beautiful Sunsets, Sparkling Clean, Comfortable","We were offered a 72 hour booking special to give the Shore Cliffs a try for a wedding anniversary weekend.  With wood flooring, air conditioning, sofa, patio and an oceanfront view I was intrigued and called to book the room. The folks who answered the phone were so professional. I expressed a concern about the wildlife on the property, they answered truthfully saything that the oceanside rooms have the best view of the sunset; but that if I wasn't happy with the smell in the oceanside room, they would be able to offer us a more acceptable room on the property. When we arrived we got to our room and it was PERFECT -- no smell in the room itself.  Sitting on the patio, there are times when the breeze shifts and you can get a whiff of seaweed and wildlife.  One reviewer said it best -- there is an undeniable fishy, wildlife smell on this property due to the California Brown Pelicans, seagulls and Perigrine nesting on the cliffs out on the peninsula.  

But with that said, this hotel does an ABSOLUTELY IMPRESSIVE JOB to keep the patios, pool and walk ways free as possible of bird droppings.  We did not use the swimming pool; but the spa was AMAZING and the temperature was PERFECT!   It's actually beautiful to see these birds enjoying their habitat right in front of you.   We stayed in an oceanfront room 130.  It was sparkling clean and comfortable in every way.  We loved enjoying the starry lit night sky and seeing the lights of the Pismo pier at night  and then waking up to see the cliffs, the birds, the beautiful grounds and gazebo right outside our door.  The staff in the breakfast room were so friendly and professional.  They greeted us personally and asked us if there was anything they could do to make breakfast better.  There was a great selection of scones, an oatmeal bar, boiled eggs, scrambled egg omelet, sausage, french toast and waffles along with a variety of breads.  Loved the plantation shutters, comfortable couch, firm bed, comfortable linens.  Water pressure in the shower was awesome. Refrigerator and microwave was a great benefit to support healthy eating. I was also impressed with IVY, the virtual text assistant that gave us confidence that we could ask for anything we needed -- extra towels, attention to our patio,room cleaning, etc.  

We usually stay in Moonstone Beach or Cayucos -- we very much enjoyed staying in sunshiney Pismo to be closer to some of our favorite restaurants.

joanh2554,1,,2018-09-30,COUPLES,2018-09-16,2,Shore Cliff Hotel Review,The negative on this hotel is that where the views are beautiful and the room was nice that the awful smell from the Pelicans that live on the bluff at the hotel site isdisgusting and permeates the air so that you can not sit comfortably on the deck norwalk to the gazebo which overlooks the  ocean.,,,5.0,4.0,,3.0,4.0,FunInSunPismoBeach,Front Office Manager,2018-09-17,"We appreciate you taking the time to give us your feedback.  I am very sorry your stay at the hotel was not up to par.  We share our location with different species of wildlife and we love to watch them as they fly freely.  Unfortunately, as much as we do our best to keep our property clean the smell of the ocean and wildlife are present.  Despite this, we hope to be able to welcome your back on a return visit to Pismo Beach,

edwardweston52,3,"Los Angeles, California",2018-09-30,SOLO,2018-09-14,4,Los Angeles Get-away,"Wanted a quick get-away from the LA hustle and bustle. The Shore Cliff Hotel was a great choice. It sits on a cliff with views of the ocean and the Pismo Pier. It is a short drive or slightly longer walk to the center of Pismo. There is also beach access nearby. The accommodations were fine with a comfortable bed. Each room has a balcony or walk-out patio. The grounds are nicely landscaped. The included breakfast is what you might expect.It is important to note that the cliff is also home to a colony of pelicans, many gulls and even a few peregrine falcons. While the birds are not bothersome, you need to be aware of bird droppings and there can an odor of bird guano.",,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,FunInSunPismoBeach,Front Office Manager,2018-09-17,"Thank you for choosing to stay at our hotel during your getaway from LA.

Jan B,135,"Walnut Creek, California",2018-09-30,COUPLES,2018-09-08,5,I highly recommend this hotel.  The little things count!,"Our room was considered a pier view but it WAS the best view beyond a two bedroom ocean front suite.  We stayed in room 305, although we had booked an ocean front room on the highest floor- which in the section was the second floor/no elevator. Upon arriving at the hotel I realized that the room would have been mostly a view off of the cliff and not able to see waves crashing which was my goal.  Although crashing waves could be easily heard in that room.  So we had the opportunity to go to another highest floor room in the section with an elevator on the third floor.  When we saw the view and heard crashing waves we were very pleased.  The elevator was a major bonus as I have a painful knee.  Also we saved over $60.00 for a two night stay! The two-queen bed room was clean and quite large.  The balcony was perfect too.  Some small unexpected and welcomed room amenities were binoculars, large desk calendar, double sink vanity, and another small sink near the microwave and mini-fridge.  The bathroom was stocked with several large fluffy towels, and Bath & Body Works products.  Unexpected amenities was a large magnifying makeup mirror and a special box containing Q tips and cotton balls.  The lobby has free coffee and tea until 8:30PM and freshly baked yummy cookies packaged by twos in the late afternoon.  Front desk staff was very welcoming and accommodating with a late check-out time. The hotel ground are beautifully landscaped and very extensive.  Check out the pergola too.  Some reviews mentioned the stinky birds---  we found that the slight 'sometimes' odor only when the winds changed.  But looking down and watching the multitude of cliff birds while walking the grounds was easily worth the trade-off.  We also walked over to The Ventana Restaurant for a wonderful late lunch after checking out.",Room 305 had the best of everything for us!,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,,FunInSunPismoBeach,Front Office Manager,2018-09-09,"It is amazing people like yourself that really appreciate what we do, that make us love our jobs and continue to put in the effort that you see in the level of service we provide.

matthew b,128,"Los Angeles, California",2018-09-30,COUPLES,2018-09-06,4,There's Good Things and There's...,"The good:

The service is beyond excellent - Anthony at the front was awesome - They had champagne glasses and wine glasses ready for us.

The pool was 83 degrees, large enough to swim laps - plenty of towels, the jacuzzi not over hot. Perfect

The room was well maintained, comfortable, the ocean front was fantastic.

10 minutes in, got a text from ""Ivy"" asking if we needed anything. We did and it was delivered in minutes! Awesome! ""Ivy"" also asked if we wanted to waive housekeeping, they would take 10 bucks off the bill. Helping to save the environment is a very positive enticement! Kudos!

Whales strode by on our first day there and it was an incredible site

Tried the gym one day and it was pretty decent with updated equipment

Here's what you do need to know.

If you can get beyond the overly fishy smell as you arrive, you'll be fine. If you don't like fishy smells, you won't be fine. There's some sort of sanctuary where pelicans, seagulls and the like gather.

There's bird crap everywhere. There's not a lot maintenance can do, but that's one area that needs tending to, especially in the pool area. I mean its EVERYWHERE. 

The breakfast was OKAY. Bacon was lame, eggs were... I'm not sure what they were... no potatoes on both days. Cereal selection is just 3. Bagels and English Muffins were of the ""cheap"" variety. It wasn't bad, and its included so I guess I really shouldn't be complaining.

Overall, a great experience.

Oh, and you CAN walk down to the wonderfully long 5 mile beach. Just ask the front desk and they'll be happy to give you directions.",,,5.0,,5.0,5.0,,FunInSunPismoBeach,Front Office Manager,2018-09-08,"Thank you for sharing your detailed experience at our Shore Cliff Hotel.

Paul G,113,"London, United Kingdom",2018-08-31,FAMILY,2018-08-29,4,Perfect pit stop off the Pacific Coast Highway,"I was looking for a one or two night stopover between longer stops in Carmel/Monterrey & Santa Barbara on our family road trip from San Fran to San Diego and decided upon  the Shore Cliffs based upon past TA reviews.

The location is perfect, just off the PCH & there’s free parking which you won’t get with the hotels in downtown Pismo.

There’s also a decent restaurant, Ventana Grill, right next door which makes for the perfect one night stopover. 

We actually stayed 2 nights to break up our road trip so we got to relax around the pool for a day. We even managed to spot some whales offshore with the aid of the free binoculars provided in the rooms.

The sea facing rooms offer amazing views & the sunsets are simply stunning.

You also get a birds eye view (excuse the pun) of hundreds of Pelicans who nestle on the shore cliffs by the hotel.

The front desk staff are all super friendly & helpful and there is iced water & coffee available around the clock in the reception area. We borrowed the Bocce balls (similar to French Boules) & enjoyed a game on their court.

There is no bar but you can purchase reasonably priced beer & wine for your own consumption from the front desk.

The free breakfast is nothing to write home about & proved to be a bit of a bun fight getting a table, but hey it’s free, so if nothing else just grab some coffee & some fruit and be grateful!

In summary, the perfect stopover if like us you are working your way up or down the PCH.

Couldn’t ask for a better view, nice clean room, great staff, good breakfast and beautiful grounds around the entire resort.  Great wildlife viewing from our room.  Perfect balcony to see the whales and dolphins.  My only complaint is beyond the control of the hotel itself.... the seagulls. I have read previous reviews with complaints about them, but figured we give it a shot anyway, understanding it’s part of being on the shore.  As mentioned before, the staff is aware and does a great job cleaning up as best as possible.  It wasn’t so much the mess or smell, but the noise!  We had hoped for falling asleep hearing the waves crash all night, but the ocean was drowned out by the seagulls all instead, especially in the early morning.   Maybe it was just where our particular room was situated, close to the bluff where they sit most, but it was constant and obnoxious, especially one seagull with a distinct sound.  There was a minor issue with the cable, and they promptly fixed it within minutes, very nice staff that seemed to truly care that our stay was going well. Even with all that I rate this hotel pretty high.  Would love to give it 5 stars, and feel bad I can’t for something beyond their control.

Marcy BT,10,,2018-07-31,COUPLES,2018-07-30,5,Amazing place to stay for a weekend away,"This place was perfect. It is about a mile walk downtown. Far enough from downtown to be nice and quiet for the night. The bed was super comfortable. The view of the beach from our room was amazing. It is not right on the beach, but on a cliff and you walk down about 60 stairs to get to the beach. Not bad at all. The service was amazing, and restaurant next door was yummy too.",Spacious rooms with comfortable beds and huge bathrooms.,,5.0,5.0,,5.0,,FunInSunPismoBeach,Front Office Manager,2018-08-06,"Thank you for staying with us and sharing your 5 star experience with us.

Harman F,19,"Asheville, North Carolina",2018-07-31,FAMILY,2018-07-22,4,"Great View, Friendly Staff","On the plus side the view, pool, birds and staff were terrific.  Sitting outside the room with a glass of wine in the evening was wonderful.    They have quite the breakfast spread. Average fare but better than most included breakfasts. 

Ventana, the restaurant next door, was top shelf as well and I highly recommend it.    

Neutral was that it took till almost 5:00 until our room was ready. We had a tour of Cal Poly University so it was only a minor annoyance, could have been negative if we had arrived exhausted.  I would recommend calling first, the maid staff is good but seemed slow. Could have been a one day thing though to be fair. 

Also neutral were the bird droppings. One has to understand that you are going to get this everywhere you place a hotel so close to nature and I am sure EVERY hotel on the cliff has the same challenge.  This would have been negative if it were located on an average street but watching the birds flock at the end of the evening was pretty spectacular.

Michael T,1,,2018-07-31,FAMILY,2018-07-20,2,Bird Droppings,"The hotel has a major issue with bird droppings. We cut our stay short due to this. The entire property is covered in bird droppings. The smell was gross and I'm pretty sure it's a health hazard. I understand it would be hard to remove the birds but there's no excuse for not keeping the property clean. Sending someone out there with a hose every morning is all it would take. You can also hire a company to chase the birds away with dogs. It only takes a few days of having dogs on site and the birds will stay away.

Bed linens are cheap. Not soft.

Bathrooms are not updated. 

Fitness center was dirty and out of cleaning wipes. Another health hazard.

The TV in the breakfast room had a political news show on.

The room was clean, spacious and the beds were comfortable. The family enjoyed the pool and hot tub with pool towels available by the pool. The breakfast was nothing special but it was nice that it was provided with the price of the room. Breakfast included eggs, french toast, waffles, fruit, yogurt, oatmeal, coffee, etc. The wall air conditioner kept the room cool even in 100 degree weather outside though like other reviewers stated, the AC is loud. A turnoff was that it smelled like fish outside the rooms, but that wasnt the hotels fault and more a result of the location. Hotel isnt close enough to get to the beach and so we drove to Pismo beach.

Upon arrival I discovered that indeed the sofa did pull out and was already made, which was a relief because I didn't want to set-up and make an airbed since we arrived late and were very tired. 
Nice pool open till 10pm. We took the kids night swimming and watching the sea gulls fly over with the lights of the pool was very entertaining, like a light show at a bird park.

The hotel and grounds sit atop a cliff that overlooks the Pacific. This cliff is home to many pelicans that you can observe up close. We also saw many sea otters in the wave.  All of the amenities were well thought out including binoculars that helped us see the otters. The room itself was spacious, airy and well appointed. And what a view from the balcony!!

kaeo y,7,,2018-06-30,COUPLES,2018-06-26,2,"Great Establishment, disappointing customer service","We really would recommend staying here. The location is great, and so are the amenities. Honestly, we would have given this place a higher rating, but the lack of customer service warrants a lower grade. There was a plumbing issue during our stay there, and although it was unforeseen, my wife and I were unable to get ready (specifically shower) until 30 mins before the noon check out time. We were told to utilize the bathrooms in smaller building or the bathroom in the pool area. The bathrooms in the smaller building were full. Therefore we had to use the single bathroom in the pool area. Although in the grand scheme of things this is a minor inconvenience, but it was a little embarrasing to bring your toothbrush, etc to the pool area and with a handful of people swimming, etc. We thought we would have be comped for the inconvenience at check out or at least given the option to have a late check out, but nothing was offered during the event or after at the counter. Besides this freak accident, we really enjoyed our stay and would encourage you to book here as well. We plan on making this the place we stay when we are in Pismo. ",,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,,,5

Our room was on the ground level overlooking the pool and with a gorgeous view onto the shoreline and ocean. Better views probably from higher up, but we were thrilled with our room. A little dark because of the balcony above and walls outside, but it gave privacy which we liked. The room was good size with small kitchenette, huge bathroom with two sinks and everything very modern. Nice touches throughout like the binoculars on the desk for guests to use. The grounds were very well kept and clean. You can walk out to the cliff to the gazebo, hang out on the swinging chairs and just enjoy super nice views from the front of the hotel.

Went to sleep listening the ocean waves and woke up to the gorgeous view of the ocean. It is a short 10 minute walk to the beach and the sand is so soft and the beach was pretty quiet. The bed was super comfortable and the room was nice and very clean. The grounds are really peaceful and nice with tons of places to sit and relax- I love the swings situated throughout the property. It would be nice if they cleaned the grounds a little better- there was a lot of bird crap on the walkways etc but there are lots of birds so I guess that is hard to keep on top of.

We thought it was pretty substantial especially being complimentary.  I loved the oatmeal bar, my husband enjoyed the meat of the day plus eggs, toast of all kinds, fresh fruit, orange juice etc... the coffee was exceptional.  The breakfast attendant was beyond awesome!  She even called my husband over before 7:00 as he was going out to the car to see if she could make him a cup of coffee.  So thoughtful!",building 2 is where breakfast is served.,,5.0,,,5.0,5.0,FunInSunPismoBeach,Front Office Manager,2018-05-28,"Thank you for sharing your detailed review.

kathleen m,13,,2018-05-31,COUPLES,2018-05-26,3,Celebrating my 70th Birthday and our 50th Anniversary,"Can't say enough about the location of this hotel! Tres Magnifique!
Restaurant next door was fabulous too! And so handy!!
Breakfast food was average quality, but a lot of variety! Kitchen staff were always attentive, friendly, and kept the premises very clean! Hats off to them!
Staff at reception desk could have been much friendlier! Two staff members almost appeared surly and completely ignored people going in and out of lobby (very intent on their own private conversations) One young man could not give us any local info except hotel brochure. We were interested in hiking, etc. Tina at desk seemed the most friendly. We were texted by housekeeping staff that if we skipped their services we would get a $10 credit. We agreed, but no credit showed up on our bill. Unfortunately I did not go over the bill until we were driving away. It was not worth $10 to return to desk and ask..................Overall I would highly recommend this hotel's location, the room was nicely equipped (except for balky screen door). I wanted to spend these happy celebrations in a fabulous place and this view was more than satisfying!",,4.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,FunInSunPismoBeach,Front Office Manager,2018-05-28,"Happy Birthday and Happy Anniversary!

I highly recommend the full ocean view rooms.  Pierside rooms can be good, but do be wary of which one you are assigned.  A few of them can be a disappointment.  The staff was professional and helpful.  The beds are a piece of heaven and we had an excellent sleep.  We kept the sliding glass door to our balcony open about 6 inches to hear the ocean break on the rocks below - so peaceful.  Breakfast:  If you are not an egg person, it's fine; if you are, everything is microwaved, which is why this is a 4 star instead of a 5.  A good breakfast is important to us.

juley12,106,"Lymington, United Kingdom",2018-04-30,FRIENDS,2018-05-18,5,Spectacular ocean view! Fabulous! Stunning ,"Travelling with friends on a road trip from San Francisco to Los Angeles, this was our second stop off. Absolutely stunning location. Couldn’t fault the hotel, staff, location, view or weather. Just amazing. Actually arrived on my birthday, 30 April, and my kids in Australia and Switzerland sent flowers which the hotel staff had arranged in our room along with a bag of sweets and the staff had even given me a birthday card, and sculpted the towels into crab/fish shapes. Fabulous service. 

The bedroom was spacious and very clean. The bed was huge and very comfortable. The bathroom was luxurious, with his and hers sinks, toiletries, hairdryer and robe.  The Reception area had free coffee, tea and water. Breakfast was good with choices of cereals, fruit, yogurt, eggs, bacon and sausages. This varied daily. The pool was warm, clean and lovely. There is a spa pool but we didn’t use it.  

Pismo is a great base to explore from. We visited Hearst Castle, Ragged Point to see the elephant seals, Avila Beach, Morro Bay, and the night market in San Luis Obispo and we even hired a Mustang for a day. 

A great place to stay. I thoroughly recommend it. I would love to go back some day. We loved it so much that even though we’d only booked for 3 nights, we extended our stay and spent a fourth night here before heading down to Santa Barbara.

Saxonomous,96,"Nottingham, United Kingdom",2018-03-31,COUPLES,2018-05-14,2,Oh Dear,"We were driving the Pacific Coast Highway from San Fransisco to LA and we had chosen this hotel as a mid point stay. We had a convertible mustang and this trip was a real Bucket List moment. We envisaged a great beach front hotel and had booked an Ocean View room for extra $.
Well we had a bit of an unfortunate detour at Big Sur because the signs, although saying PCH was closed further down...... did not say until we were a good 40 miles beyong Monterey, that there was no detour (I have to say American road signs are not great. There is so much signage at junctions which is incidental, you often go wrong). This meant we arrived on Sunday evening in Pismo beach very late around 10pm. The whole town looked like California's version of Skegness. In any event we consoled ourself that at $180 a night our hotel would be great. Oh no.... it is an Inn. UK equivalent of TRavelodge except the rooms are better furnished.
We asked about food and were pointed to a basket with one pack of cookies in it. Having got to our room, we then questioned the receptionist further and was told there was a vending machine in the other building. You can imagine what dinner was!
The next morning the weather was a typical California mist, breakfast was a mediocre self serve buffet, so we got out of there quickly.",,1.0,2.0,,1.0,,,FunInSunPismoBeach,Front Office Manager,2018-05-15,"Thank you for taking the time to share your experience.

LizBrick,93,,2018-04-30,FAMILY,2018-04-26,4,Visit our Mustang ,"The hotel was clean and well appointed. We had 2 rooms, but they were in different buildings.  My husband & I enjoyed a room with king sized bed, couch, desk, small refrigerator, large flat screen TV.  We had a small balcony over looking the cliffs and looking out towards the ocean and up the coast.  The room was clean updated contemporary style.  The other room had: two queen sized beds, slightly larger, with a bigger bathroom area... (vanities are separate from toilet & bath area). There was a balcony which overlooked the properties pool area, buildings and partial view of ocean.

The breakfast was standard, however, there were pre-made Belgium waffles... that were actually still frozen.  Coffee was surprisingly worthy for those who enjoy a strong hot coffee (Starbucks strength).

The hotel is situated on the cliffs.  Beach access is achieved by meandering along the cliff walkway behind several hotel properties.  About a half mile away at Seacrest is a 90 step staircase that descends to the beach.  A walk along the beach to the pier and back is 2 miles.  At the pier you can walk up and meander around the Pismo Beach shops & restaurants.

We were disappointed that our rooms were so far apart.  Our aunt was sharing a room with our young teen, and left a day earlier than we did.  We convinced our college aged child to leave his apartment and share her room.  Fortunately, this worked out for us.

When we arrived at this hotel the first thing we noticed is it's location - literally right on the cliff of the shore.  The view was awesome.  The desk personnel were very, very professional, friendly and helpful.  The room was quite a surprise to us when we entered.  It was huge!  And the quality of the interior was actually far better than that of the Hyatt we stayed at during our trip.  The bathroom was probably nicer than our own house.  This hotel is very well maintained and much better in quality than many of the hotels we've stayed at in the past with much higher star ratings. And the view of the ocean from our wonderful balcony was just fantastic.  The real surprise to this hotel was the wonderful grounds behind the hotel on the cliff of the ocean. The views from there were spectacular and we enjoyed quite a sunset the evening we arrived.

Liz F,1,,2018-04-30,FAMILY,2018-04-05,5,"Gorgeous views, friendly service",Get a “ocean front” room! Gorgeous view! Very quiet at night. Loved the swings and gazebo on the property. Heated pool and hot tub. Highly recommended!!! Beach access is just along the bluff through the next hotel (about 15 min walk) worth the walk bc it keeps the hotel traffic low and private!  This was the best hotel on the bluff in my opinion. Very happy with our stay :) ocean front has the best views of ocean and sunset! ,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,FunInSunPismoBeach,Front Office Manager,2018-04-08,"Thank you for sharing with us your 5 star experience.

leighbell,72,"Atlanta, Georgia",2018-03-31,NONE,2018-04-04,5,This is a very cool place! ,"We only stayed here overnight (March 6th) during a road trip. We arrived after dark and when I woke up in the morning and looked outside I could not believe my eyes! Maybe the most gorgeous view of ever seen! The room was modern and extremely clean.  Being clean is my number one priority in a hotel, and  I had no complaints! There was a paper in the room describing the wildlife that you can see right from the chairs on the rooms front porch. They also leave a pair of binoculars and cleaning wipes for you to use-I thought that was a neat touch. I’ve told everyone about this place! I wish I had been able to stay there longer and I definitely am going back!

hwilke611882,1,,2018-02-28,COUPLES,2018-02-26,3,Just Average,"I wanted to hear the ocean on my wedding night, but instead I heard the wind howling and whistling through the front door and rattling the door and something on the roof (venting?) all night. I may as well have stayed at Motel 6. I realize you can’t change the weather - but surely you can secure the doors/windows and other exterior items to not allow such terrible noise when a bit of wind comes through. The bed was so hard I slept only a total of a couple hours and was in terrible pain through the night. Overall the room was basic, I could tell renovations had been done which were nice but we still found old fixtures and other things that reminded us of Motel 6. It was great to have a breakfast but it was lacking options. It was average and considered “full” breakfast, but the choices were slim. For the price we paid - we could have stayed in a grander place or saved a couple hundred and stayed at Motel 6. The staff were very helpful, gracious and did everything they could within their power - but the whole stay left us regretful and wanting more from our $300.",,1.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,FunInSunPismoBeach,Front Office Manager,2018-03-05,"Congratulations on your wedding.

WARM 82 degree pool and 104 degree jacuzzi. Work out room (that we did not visit) is available. Beautiful view of ocean.  Although dogs are not allowed in this hotel, dogs are allowed (with an additional fee) in their sister hotel (Inn at the Cove). Free rental of binoculars was a nice touch.

I had to deduct 1 star because there were not enough parking spaces (people were parking in the no parking zones and even double parking) and our hotel door sometimes didn't lock immediately and we had to fiddle with it for several minutes.

Rumples,10987,"Tucson, Arizona",2018-01-31,COUPLES,2018-01-30,5,Spectacular Location; Wonderful Room,"We spent four nights here and this hotel tops the list of all the places where we've stayed on California's central coast during our many visits to see family in the area. To look at the complex from the road, one would not expect much. A big parking lot sprawls in front of buildings, which display open corridors with doors that lead to rooms. The noise of steady traffic from nearby Highway 101 fills the area. But as soon as we entered the bright, spacious and quiet lobby to register, we saw the beautiful grounds and pounding ocean at the rear of the property.

Our third-floor king room came with perfect soundproofing. It offered a partial view of the Pacific and overlooked the hotel's big pool. A balcony brought us out many times to sit and enjoy the surroundings. I often brought binoculars here, provided in the room for guests to view the wildlife and ocean. Inside, we enjoyed the comfort of the king bed and two-seat sofa; a big work table with two chairs to accommodate two guests; two luggage racks; robes; reliable, free Wi-Fi; excellent lighting; and the list goes on. The bathroom offered two sinks and a combo tub/shower. I thought it a bit awkward, however, to have the hand-towel rack over the toilet rather than anywhere near the sinks. Housekeeping kept everything spotless. But we learned to be careful about leaving a do-not-disturb sign on our door. The one day we did that for a brief period, no one returned to check; and the room received no service.

A buffet continental breakfast was included in the room price. It offered myriad items, including cereal; oatmeal;  yogurt; fresh fruit; two hot items, such as scrambled eggs, which changed daily; pastries; juices; tea and coffee. We ate breakfast at various times and always found a vacant table, though the day we came at 9:30 a.m., the oatmeal had run out. 

I enjoyed strolling along the paths of the lovely landscaped grounds with its many relaxing seating arrangements. Stunning views of the coast beckoned in two directions. The hotel sits back from a huge sheer cliff, so there is no direct access to the beach from this location. But a short walk toward the town center leads one to surf and sand.

When we stayed in January 2018, the weekday room rate almost doubled during the weekend.",,,,,,,,FunInSunPismoBeach,Front Office Manager,2018-02-03,"Thank you for providing us with your detailed description of your stay at our property.

maryf55,588,,2018-01-31,COUPLES,2018-01-27,4,Lovely setting,"We drove to Pismo for a two-night midwinter getaway from the SF Bay Area, and hit the weather just perfectly. We booked an oceanfront room, which is in the north wing of the hotel, looking out to the gazebo with a panoramic view of the sea. The balcony is outfitted with two comfortable tall patio chairs and a table, and we spent some time with the provided binoculars watching a whale spout in the distance. Idyllic.
The reception area is quite nice, with water and coffee available. They also have some fresh-baked cookies in the late afternoon. Check in was smooth. We asked about the adjacent restaurant, the Ventana Grill, but were not told that we could receive a 10% discount for hotel guests-- I overheard that as someone else registered. We dined there both nights since it was an easy walk over, so it was quite relevant for us.
The room was spotless, spacious, and the bed and loveseat were comfortable. We were a bit surprised to find that only paper cups and plastic glasses were provided, however, since the rest of the amenities were more upscale. After making a call to the desk we received a couple of glasses for cocktails, delivered by a sweet young man. 
Breakfast was okay, and the woman in charge did a very good job keeping the food and coffee stocked and the area was clean. The sausages were good, but the eggs somewhat rubbery. There were plenty of other options, like oatmeal, yogurt, cereal, French toast (pre-made and ready for the toaster).
The last time we stayed at the Shore Cliff it was still a Best Western property. They have done a nice job updating it, and I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again.",,,,,,,,FunInSunPismoBeach,Front Office Manager,2018-01-31,"Thank you for sharing your positive feedback with all of us.

Onemorereview,65,,2018-01-31,FAMILY,2018-01-16,5,Wish we’d stayed longer,"We spent one night in the beautiful 2 bedroom suite on the 3rd floor. It had a fantastic view that was uninterrupted by other rooms. The balcony which you could access from both bedrooms was right on the cliff, so we had the beautiful sound of the ocean crashing all night. It was lovely to sit there and watch the sun set over the ocean. We also watched sea otters, pelicans, sea gulls and many other birds.
The rooms were perfect for sharing with family. There is a small kitchenette, not full kitchen, but breakfast was included with the room. The bathroom needed some updating - the tap for the shower was a little difficult to use.
But overall, a great place to stay when in Pismo Beach and we would’ve been happy to stay longer.",,,,,,,,FunInSunPismoBeach,Front Office Manager,2018-01-19,"Thank you for sharing your experience in one of our family suites.

msg60,27,California,2018-01-31,COUPLES,2018-01-16,3,Beautiful location but . . .,"Recently spent a week at the Shore Cliff Hotel.  It is located on an amazing piece of the shore -- rocky cliff below, nice sound of the surf, beautiful views/sunsets.  BUT . . . it's also on top of a little cove area which unfortunately creates a horrible SMELL most days!  Luckily it did not smell at night, so we could still keep the patio door open to sleep to the sound of the surf.  Not sure if the smell happens all year or just certain times.  They also do not have a beach access so if you are planning to walk along the beach or take your kids to the beach you will have to drive or walk to a different location.

The rooms have been recently renovated -- nice but some things weren't updated -- like the wall unit air conditioner (needed maintaining) and the sliding door/screen would barely move to open.  Friendly front desk staff.  Breakfast is passable -- no more than that.  Breakfast room could have been a bit cleaner.  Also the sheets/bedding were of VERY poor quality!  They were old and had pills -- not very comfortable to sleep on!

We had previously stayed a couple of spots down the coast at the Seacrest and this is a similar kind of layout but felt more private.

We had a full ocean-view room and arrived late afternoon to enjoy the view and the sunset, watching the birds swooping around and someone getting married on the grounds right in front of our room!  The views of the pacific are fab and were totally unobstructed (although there is a large lawned area in front so we were not directly on the cliff edge but this was fine.

The lobby is nice and there are numerous places to wander around on the grounds and sit out, including swinging seats to enjoy the sunset from if you don't have an oceanview room balcony to do it from.

The pool was great too!  Large, with a proper deep end and a nice hot tub too, with plenty of towels and seating around.  You can swim in the pool while enjoying the oceanviews!

The spacious room had a very comfy bed, and a nice sofa and we slept with the sliding doors open to hear the ocean at night.  We would definitely stay here again if we are travelling up the California coast as it was also affordable compared to some of the pricey options on this strip of coast that can't really provide a better view anyway, and are just charging more for fancy amenities, so save those few extra bucks and enjoy the peaceful pacific from here instead.

There is no restaurant on site, but there is a great deli (Depalo & Sons) doing lots of different food down the road in Shell Beach including cold deli stuff and things to heat up, and we ate dinner at McClintocks (also in Shell Beach on the other side of the highway) which was fab, and there is a place close by if you don't want to drive anywhere.",,,3.0,4.0,5.0,,,FunInSunPismoBeach,Front Office Manager,2018-01-15,"Thank you for taking the time to give us your feedback about your stay at our hotel.

ALOKBASU,79,"Kolkata (Calcutta), India",2017-12-31,FAMILY,2018-01-08,5,Excellent Hotel - Highly Recommended,"Five of us along with a baby stayed in this hotel 2 nights from 23rd December to 25th December, 2017 at room number 212. Its a suite consisting of two bedrooms, a living room, a small kitchen, one toilet and two balconies, one attached to the living room and the other one is attached to both the bedrooms and virtually on the sea. The hotel itself is having best location in Pismo Beach. All the rooms have sea views. But the suite where we stayed is simply awesome. Even if you sit in the bed room you have the feeling of sitting right on sea. Amazing views. You can pass time simply sitting in the balcony watching wonderful sunrise to best ever sunset, lots of seagulls, pelicans, turtles, dolphins and if luck favours even whales. Rooms are provided with a pair of binoculars for watching sea life. The check in and check out process were seamless and prompt. Front office staff are very efficient and courteous. The hotel does provide complimentary breakfast having impressive variety of food to cater to different tastes and needs. However, it does not have a restaurant. Hence, you have to depend on outside restaurants for other meals or you can prepare your own food in the microwave oven in the kitchen of your room. Ventana Grill restaurant is closest to the hotel.

Only sore point is that the bathtub needs immediate repair, I am sure management will look into it.

Overall it was excellent experience. I can say with confidence that it was my one of the most memorable stays. This hotel is very highly recommended.",,,,,,,,FunInSunPismoBeach,Front Office Manager,2018-01-12,"Thank you for sharing your detailed 5 star experience with us.

David W,144,"Mountain View, California",2017-12-31,FAMILY,2018-01-04,4,I can see why Shore Cliff is highly ranked,"We have usually stayed at the Sea Crest in Pismo in the past but we gave Shore Cliff a try this time around.  We were very impressed with the hotel grounds, as it's right next to the Ventana Grill and has spectacular views.  Our room was on the very edge of the main building that's right by the Ventana Grill on the 2nd floor.  Even though it was right by the Ventana parking lot, the noise was minimal.  The room was big enough for our family of 4 with a little balcony with chairs.  I'm glad we were in this building and not the bigger 3 wing complex that's closer to the pool.

The front desk staff was very friendly, but I often found them to be overwhelmed at checkin/checkout time (only one person at the desk). 

The hot chocolate station in the lobby was a nice touch.  They have a system which allows you to keep in touch and make options via text message... like opting out of housekeeping for a $10/day savings if you so choose.

The breakfast was a little lacking in my opinion for the cost of a $300/night place.  The hot items were bland (mass produced fried eggs and bacon that was paper thin and tasteless).  Oatmeal was watered down.  That's the only reason I took off one star on this review.

Other than that, the pool is spacious and heated, so your kids will love it.  You can't really easily walk to the beach, but it's not too far away.  Overall, we had a really nice 4 day stay.",Stay in the main 2 story building on the 2nd floor,,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,FunInSunPismoBeach,Front Office Manager,2018-01-08,"Thank you for taking the time to share your positive comments with the rest of us.

The staff is incredibly knowledgeable, kind, and welcoming.
The rooms are so roomy, clean, and comfy as hell! I never wanted to leave!
The hotel is very considerate and offers credits to their guests when guests take advantage of environmentally friendly options such as using reusable glassware, and skipping house keeping (fantastic).
Amenities are great! Homemade cookies, complimentary breakfast, heated pool, bath and body works toiletries (which smell like luxury itself).
The view...stunning.
The location of this hotel was just minutes away from everywhere my touristy soul desired to go.

Over the past two months I’ve dealt with recovering from an auto accident injury, insurance company battles, losing my car, having my back up car stolen, and seeing my grandfather go in and out of the hospital.
This lovely little beachside hotel gave me the TLC that I needed.

Erwin W,19,"Los Angeles, California",2017-12-31,COUPLES,2017-12-06,5,"Location, location, location","The hotel is located on top of the cliffs overlooking a beautiful bay. From some rooms you can see the beach all the way to the sand dunes towards the south as well as the tip of the San Luis Obispo Bay. Google maps gives a good idea about the location of the hotel which can actually be seen on ""satellite view"" as two buildings with the pool in between.
The Ventana Grill restaurant next to it is no longer part of the hotel and it offers Mexican specialties but we didn't try it. The room price includes  a buffet breakfast which is just average. They call it ""continental breakfast"" but usually this description does not specify the continent, and that is for good reason.
The rooms and beds are very comfortable, the personnel is very nice and the noise from the waves breaking right below at the base of the cliffs is fantastic.
There are lots of seagulls and pelicans on the cliffs below. Some people didn't like the smell, but it is part of experience and we liked them.
A few miles north is Avila Beach with a pier, seafood restaurants and lots of noisy seals in the harbor. A few miles south is Arroyo Grande where you can shop deli food and beer or wine at Trader Joe's rather than going to Pismo Market in Pismo Beach. In case you go there, ask the prices before you pay.

Note: Look at the satellite view of the hotel grounds, Ask the reception clerk for a layout of the rooms and choose a room at the top floor of either building facing whatever you like of the scenery. It is worth spending a few minutes to choose carefully.","Note: If you like peace and quiet, avoid taking a room facing the swimming pool.",5.0,5.0,,,,5.0,FunInSunPismoBeach,Front Office Manager,2017-12-11,"Thank you for sharing your 5 star experience to future travelers.

Ralph A,57,"Fullerton, California",2017-11-30,COUPLES,2017-12-02,4,Awesome Ocean View from ANY Room.,Great place with fantastic cliff side ocean views. Great included breakfast selection in the morning. The cliffs are heavily populated with California Brown Pelican which was on the edge of extinction years ago. This is no longer a problem. The odor as you enter the breezy lobby of the hotel comes from the pelican hangout just outside the other side of the lobby. Sardines and anchovies are abundant in these waters and the pelicans all seem to be well fed. We stayed in room 303 and listened to the waves crashing all night. It was great!,The South facing rooms are the quietest and have the freshest ocean air.,,5.0,,5.0,5.0,,FunInSunPismoBeach,Front Office Manager,2017-12-04,"Thank you for your review.  I am glad you enjoyed the California Brown Pelican's we have visiting off our cliffs.  They are wonderful birds to watch.  We hope to welcome you back during your next visit to the central coast.

C323S,21,"Los Angeles, California",2017-11-30,FAMILY,2017-12-02,4,Stunning Views!,"With a nice location at the northern end of the ocean-front strip of hotels, the Shore Cliff overlooks two beautiful, rocky coves and a grassy promontory with a gazebo and stunning Pacific vistas. A stroll around the grounds affords several spectacular views – take it at night for a quiet, more magical experience. We enjoyed looking out from our second floor balcony, which would have been a perfect spot for whale watching if we had visited later in the season. The hotel has a recently renovated feel; everything is very clean and pleasant. The staff were exceptionally professional and accommodating. The hotel uses the Iris text messaging service, which was very helpful. The breakfast room was fine, nothing special, with lots of great coffee and a moderate amount of food choices (which included pre-made cheese omelettes). Great pool area, with a hot tub – perfect for chilly west coast nights. Overall, a very nice, clean place with unbeatable views. The only thing lacking for a 5-star rating was a little charm.",,,5.0,,5.0,4.0,,FunInSunPismoBeach,Front Office Manager,2017-12-04,"Thank you for your detailed review about our stay here at our hotel.

Deeply inviting and expansive rooms. The suite-style room I stayed in had an expansive closet; a writing desk; a flat-screen HD TV; a kitchenette area with a microwave, sink, coffee maker and medium-sized fridge; an expansive, charming bathroom with a cozy tub; a very comfortable King-sized bed; and the highlight – a balcony with a breathtaking view of the Pacific Ocean and nearby Dinosaur Caves Park. There's also a great little gym and fantastic common areas, along with a complimentary breakfast. The entire property is perched right atop the Pacific Ocean, right next to Ventana restaurant. The front desk staff is accommodating and hard-working, especially Valerie. This is truly an EPIC spot (especially if you love nature and birds, like I do).

marc000007,33,,2017-11-30,FAMILY,2017-11-23,5,Loved it.,"Great hotel with great views and great staff. We asked for extra towels, and extra pillows, and they were brought by warm and kind staff. We stopped by the f not desk to ask for a corkscrew, and they offered us nice wine glasses to enjoy our wine. 

The only thing that needs improvement is the gym. One of the elliptical machines wasn’t working, and the wall mounted AC unit wasn’t working. There is no stretching area and no free weights. I’d suggest getting a few mats, exercise balls, foam roller and a small stack of free weights (5 lbs to 25 lbs). That would cost only a few hundred dollars and would make the gym much more practical. I was going to deduct a star for this, but when I realize that not everyone uses the gym, and because everything else was so perfect, I wanted to leave it as a 5-star review.

Heated pool & jacuzzi!,"My wife and I stayed at this awesome hotel for 4 days and loved everything about it! I would like to thank the Shore Cliff Hotel for recognizing the need for Emotional Support Animal and there handlers. Our ESA dog loved the landscaping and hotel grounds. This hotel is set on the side of a cliff overlooking the coastline and very close to walking trails, beach, and restaurants. We had room # 101, It was on the ground floor and very private with no one on your left hand side. The views are amazing and you can hear the ocean crashing against the rocks from your patio and even from your bed. The rooms are very modern and decorated with clean tile/hardwood floors and black granite in the bathrooms with white tile. There are very nice thick wooden blinds in the bedroom and a medium size mini fridge/freezer and sink. We wish they had a stove if they did we would have stayed longer. They do offer breakfast that is a regular continental one with cereal, oatmeal, pastries, waffles, and juices. If they had a restaurant or more organic food options this place would have it all. (There is a Whole Foods about 7 miles away) Everyone from the front desk to the housekeepers have excellent customer service. The pool is awesome and is heated and goes from 3 ft to 9 ft very nice for a swim anytime( pool area closes at 10pm) The jacuzzi is equally nice and clean!

The hotel makes every effort for a comfortable stay.  Binoculars in the rooms, balcony, plenty of outlets to recharge electronics, robes, good lighting, storage space, butler's pantry with a sink, granite counter top, refrigerator, microwave, coffee, etc.  Large bathroom, spacious counter, with two sinks.The comfortable bed had plenty of pillows. The plantation shutters were a nice touch. The furniture was a bit dated, while the carpeting was definitely old. 

My room, 116, on the first floor had a lovely view of the pool in the foreground (pictures below of view from room, room and pelicans), with the ocean in the background. Admittedly, I am very sensitive to noise, so I found the noise annoyingly loud from guests in the pool and hot tub (too close to my room), people talking in the hallway, doors opening and closing.

It goes a bit downhill from there is really only one restaurant to choose from within walking distance which was packed when we were there.  The rooms were nicely appointed (we had the ocean front and ocean view rooms) but the aircon was horrendously noisy (my pet hate) in both rooms so assume that is the norm and it made the night uncomfortable - choose from earplugs or overheating. 
On checking in we kept having to bat away loads of flies in Reception and it stayed that way - maybe the hot weather was the cause but a regular spray of fly killer would have done the trick. Breakfast was the usual buffet fare and was fine.",,,,,,,,,,,,95

B8987NErobinc,9,,2017-10-31,FAMILY,2017-10-19,5,Outstanding Hotel,"I wrote an extensive positive review on Shore Cliff's Facebook page.  In summary, our room was perfect, ocean view.  Normally we request higher rooms than the ground floor, but this room was available upon arrival and we could park right outside the door which helped in unloading our things.  The public access right in front was rarely travelled and the first sunset over the ocean was spectacular.  There is a nice restaurant right next door, the Ventura Grill which is very good and reservations are recommended.  Our guest room was spacious, king bed and a couch.  Plenty of charging outlets were provided which is a must these days.  The free breakfast was adequate with the guests moving in and out quickly.  The staff provided to go plates and utensils.  Seattle Best coffee is served in the lobby and breakfast area as well as individual guest rooms.  The guest rooms also provide nice striped robes.  The cute town of Pismo Beach has an extensive garden art shop with a friendly owner and I left some money with him.  Down the road is a lovely market with tons of interesting products, so much so that our first dinner consisted of Californis's best sour dough bread and salami completed with a fine Chardonnay.  We brought our own glasses since the room was provided with inexpensive plastic ones.  We'd definitely stay there again.",,,,,,,,FunInSunPismoBeach,Front Office Manager,2017-10-20,"Thank you for your detailed feedback of your stay at our Shore Cliff Hotel and the surrounding areas.

Ronnie250,4,"Los Angeles, California",2017-10-31,COUPLES,2017-10-03,2,The only good thing about this hotel is the ocean view.,"The rooms are very expensive, There are much more better hotels for this money in the area with much better service. This hotel doesn't offer any services. They don't have a restaurant, the breakfast is very poor, no room services. The hotel is very outdated with old, stained carpets and looks more as a 3-star motel than an expensive hotel.   I wouldn't stay there again",,,1.0,2.0,,1.0,,FunInSunPismoBeach,Front Office Manager,2017-10-08,"Thank you for your review.  I am glad you enjoyed our ocean views.

The room itself was perfect- very spacious and clean and we had a small balcony area looking over the pool and the sea. The microwave, fridge and coffee machine in the room were nice touches. 
We were told that our stay included complimentary breakfast which was a bonus for us as we were not expecting this.  The breakfast was buffet style and simple but there was plenty of choice. 
We liked the fact that the hotel provided games at reception for guests to play free of charge.

-- Floors in the room creak, and the TV stand shakes every time you walk past it.

rtraveltime,9,,2017-09-30,COUPLES,2017-09-09,3,No special treatment on return visit,"Post Labor Day mid week stay
	At first I thought I was being petty although I checked trip advisor for other comments and found I was not the only returning guest that was disappointed.
	This was our third 3 night stay at the Shore Cliffs with in a 6 month period. The 1st stay was great, the 2nd very good the 3rd disappointing. Starting with check in.
	The room we reserved according to our reservation was a pier view. On check in Jon assigned us to a ground level pier view room. I told him, we had preference  NO ground level rooms. He said he was aware although there were only 2 other rooms available one ground level next to the breakfast room and one on the second floor next to the gym which was very loud. The room issued to us was the better room. He also said that if we were dissatisfied the next days we could make a request for a room change. I asked him to note the request for the morning staff as he would not be there in the morning.
	The room was nice and clean with the exception that any time other guest closed their entrance door the walls would shake with a loud thump. Other guest talking from the balcony above us and or on the walk way out side our room resonated as though they where staying with us.
	The hotel has a text concierge service ( to better assist you) The text ask question like would you like to forgo cleaning your room for a $10.00 credit and from 1 to 5 how do you rate your stay. I answered the text with a #4 and they responded (WHY). I told them and they still made no room change.
	On check out I stated my dissatisfaction with the room. The service representative apologized then justified the problem by explaining some time the hotel is full (“not this time”) and they can not accommodate every one. Although she would give me a $40 credit toward my bill. Checking my AMX my pending charge is actually $50.00 more than my reservation confirmation e-mail. I will have to deal with that now.
In summary, if your looking for a one night room while traveling you will probable be satisfied. If your there for a few days it’s a roll of the dice.",not the pier view inside,,3.0,4.0,,,5.0,FunInSunPismoBeach,Front Office Manager,2017-09-12,"We appreciate you taking the time to provide us with such candid feedback of your stay.

So was not expecting much- initially looked ok bit motelish initially - but should not judge a book by its cover.  Good size standard hotel room - but was nice surprise to have great sea view, nice patio area to sit and relax. Binoculars in the room to whale watch and spectacular place for sunset.  Room had microwave fridge so cook make popcorn etc .  In fact we went to a drivin movie at San Luis Obispo (really buzzing place and Thursday night great farmers market).  Swimming pool
Look great but no time to check.  All in all nice relaxing hotel nice people and towels soft, place near and tidy - wished we had stayed one more night more to enjoy the hotel and location.

Andrea R,2,"Menlo Park, California",2017-09-30,FAMILY,2017-09-05,5,Great Hotel for Humans and Dogs,"We've been coming to Pismo Beach for years with our dogs and generally stay down the street at the Seacrest.  Although that is nice and dog friendly, we found we prefer the ShoreCliff.  Our room was much larger and had a fantastic pier view.  The only noises we heard of other guests was some occasional footsteps above and if there were people talking outside and/or on the balcony.  Totally acceptable. The bed and pillows were very comfortable and the sofa bed offered a nice second napping spot.

Yes, there are a lot of birds and there is an...ocean-y aroma when the wind blows from a certain direction.  The birds live on the cliffs and that's just going to happen.  We only noticed it in the parking lot and our car was not impacted.  We did get to see whales from the balcony and the hotel provides binoculars.

The breakfast was a clear upgrade from what I call the ""white flour/white sugar"" offerings with eggs, waffles, bacon/sausage and oatmeal.  The warm cookies in the lobby in the afternoons are also a lovely treat.

The location is ideal as it was 1 mile from downtown and about the same from Zorro's (the dog friendly Mexican place in Shell Beach).  Both easy walks.  Beach access is through the Seacrest and was just fine if you follow the signs.  

All in all, we've found our new spot for future visits.",,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,FunInSunPismoBeach,Front Office Manager,2017-09-11,"Thank you for your detailed review.

marwha,17,"Redondo Beach, California",2017-08-31,FAMILY,2017-08-23,4,Nice property and views,"Overall, the hotel is nice, the views are great and the rooms are nicely furnished with good amenities. The breakfast was very good, although the eggs were overdone both mornings of our stay, but there were many choices. 
The pool was beautifully taken care of, although the sidewalks around the grounds were not. This is really my only complaint, there are many resident pelicans and seagulls, and the walkways were littered with poop, and the stench of the poop was pretty strong. I hope they will clean the walkways so that walking the grounds would be pleasant.

David F,29,"Melbourne, Australia",2017-08-31,COUPLES,2017-08-09,4,On route to San Francisco ,"Stayed for 1 night on a road trip from LA. A great hotel, fantastic views, great staff. Rooms clean, spacious, big bathroom, immaculate room service and cleaning. Could not want anything more. So why not 5 stars?

The 'breakfast'. I would describe as a scrum of people chasing awful food, with limited seating on paper plates and paper cups. Apparently recycled paper plates etc is saving on water costs of washing etc. China plates can be asked for but for me you should not need to ask a 3-4 star hotel for a plate. If water saving is important make sure the plug seals in the sink (it didn't). It would be better to not offer the 'breakfast' and not disappoint a fantastic experience.

I would stay again but get breakfast elsewhere.",,,,,,,,FunInSunPismoBeach,Front Office Manager,2017-08-13,"Thank you taking the time to review your stay with us.

fiveeats,26,"Oslo, Norway",2017-07-31,COUPLES,2017-08-03,2,One night stay in Shore Cliff hotel,"We had an overnight stop from our ride from Los Angeles to San Francisco. Had a late check-in (19:00). The check-in was nothing but average - and straight to the point without any smalltalk. It is easy to park right outside the hotel. 

The positive first. This hotel has a scenic view over Pismo Beach, with steep cliffs just outside the hotel. There are a lot of birds (Brown Pelicans and seagulls) and we also saw some sea lions in the water. 

Then the negative. The hotel is outdated and it smells of mold in the hallways. The pool area seem dirty (we didn't bother to use it). The room we got was clean but old, and also had this bad smell. What bothered us the most was that we didn't manage to sleep in the room. This was room 111. The room has to be near the plumming system for the whole hotel because we woke up every tenth minute by high sounds from the plumming system. I don't understand how they can place people in this room. 

We were leaving early the morning after, and tried the breakfast before we left. This is probably the worst breakfast we had on our whole stay in California. Dirty, noisy, bad selection - and the eggs and bacon for example tasted industrial. 

When checking out I told the receptionist about the problems in our room and that we couldn't sleep that night. She did not offer anything - and just said ""ok"". I have not heard something from them after either. They could have improved the impression by offering good customer service, but did not manage that either. We payed about 350 dollars for our room including taxes. This hotel is for sure NOT worth this price. Will definetely avoid in the future.",,,2.0,1.0,,2.0,,FunInSunPismoBeach,Front Office Manager,2017-08-05,"Thank you for your positive comments.

They have a texting service which was nice so if you have questions or need anything, you text it in to ""Ivy"" and they can answer your question or put in the request for you, whatever it is.  I really liked that.  They also offered us a daily credit to our room if we opted out of housekeeping.  We took advantage of that and got a 30$ credit.  After a couple days, we just switched our towels and wash rags out with the housekeeping when we saw them in the room next door.

Looking forward to (and paying up for) an ocean front room, we were absolutely appalled at the smell of pelican poop from the adjacent cliffs and rock formation being blown into our patio and room by on-shore breezes ... nauseating!  Don't get me wrong, the views are spectacular ... we just couldn't stand being outdoors on the patio to enjoy them.
Breakfast was included and went beyond continental, but ends at 10:00 AM
Rooms were clean, and bed was very comfortable, I'll have to admit ... something we look for and expect but the overall experience was simply not worth $600+++ for two nights.
Also, Pismo Beach itself is a terrible cliché of a beach town tourist trap ... terrible.  Avila Beach, a few miles north, is orders of magnitude better / nicer / cleaner ... especially the little town and beach itself.

She was professional, nicely attired, and able to answer our questions and truly made us feel welcome.  The room was excellent, we love the thoughtful touch of the “love birds “and the Sparkling Cider. Of course, the view from 311 was absolutely spectacular and the seats on the deck we found comfortable and functional. Your grounds were immaculately maintained as were the common areas of the facility. The outdoor seating was comfortable, romantic and just the right touch for relaxing. Maria (housekeeping) was wonderful and helpful. Now for points that may need improvement: In room coffee: I don’t think paper coffee cups with single serve maker is appropriate for this type of room. Breakfast was “just OK.” I expect this type of breakfast at a mid range hotel (Holiday Inn Express.) I was expecting something like Embassy Suits, a made to order omelet, variety of meats and potatoes etc. Small gas fire pits would be nice in the common outdoor areas. Not that we had time to watch much TV, but we needed maintenance staff to come up and do a minor adjustment to the remote sensor, wasn’t too happy with that.  With all that said, yes we would recommend Shore Cliff to others and yes we would stay there again. Thank you for a great stay and a most memorable honeymoon.

When we finally got to our room we were pleased which the large room with balcony overlooking the pool and offering ocean views. The binoculars were most appreciated to watch the sea life. However the room felt like it had been redecorated on the cheap. The walls were badly needing skimmed and furniture outdated.

Staff was friendly, rooms were large and many have gorgeous ocean views. Pool area is lovely as well. We had quite a cool breeze during our June 2017 stay but was still able to get in the pool and enjoy the hot tub. Breakfast was plentiful but gets quite busy between 8:30-9 am so I would recommend going a bit early. Especially loved the seagull visitors you get on your balcony and watching the pelicans fly by. Very much a family hotel and we appreciated the other guests were courteous and respectful. Would definitely recommend staying on the top floor with a pool and ocean view. Pismo Beach central town is very close by and many restaurants will deliver to the hotel.

The free breakfast is a blast-help yourself and all guests did!  This was a real nice added benefit.
You're walking distance to Pismo Beach itself-and what a wonderful beach!  What stood out most about the hotel was the staff--Tina, Katie, Lulu, Devon were too, too kind.  The maintenance staff went above and beyond.  The Martin Group, I think, own this and a few other area hotels----if the service is as good as the Shore Cliff, then this organization is doing everything right.

Shorecliff was the cleanest hotel I've ever stayed at and the bed did not give me a backache by morning. I will be bringing my kids/grandkids up soon. Although there was no access to  beach area you only had to walk a couple of properties over to access. Pool was spectacular.

We will probably look elsewhere. But every room has an ocean view. We have a dog, so we are charged $50 for the dog fee. Dog rooms are on the lower floor. These rooms have been remodeled with vinyl flooring and no carpet. (good for animals, not for humans). Parking is a real problem, especially if you are handicap. Only 3 spaces for over 50 rooms. If you get to hotel after 7 pm, you are out of luck and will park in the North 40!",,2.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,FunInSunPismoBeach,Front Office Manager,2017-05-27,"Thank you for your feedback.

The check in was simple they asked if we would like a ground floor room which we did and we got a pool/ ocean view room with spectacular views.
The room had all the facilities required the bed was large but sorry to say a little to soft for me, another minor issue was the inconsiderate neighbours above us who were heavy footed more sound proofing may have helped. 
We were also located close to the breakfast area, the breakfast supplied was more than adequate.
The hotel does not have a formal restaurant there is one at the end of the car park however caution is needed see my other review for this.

Location of hotel is remarkable, right on the cliffs overlooking the ocean, not just a tiny bit of it...a grand swath of ocean, with many vantage points including swinging recliners, fenced walkways, gazebo, tables...breathtaking. Our room with a wonderful king bed was suppose to have an ocean view...hmmmm. Maybe a sliver of ocean, mostly a fence and the pool view. The room had a fantastic bathroom, double sinks, bright. The room had wood, not real, floors which seemed not the best idea in a coastal hotel. The floor was very cold. And the couch in the room is strangely positioned, hard as a rock & without a coffee table. Odd. A couple of easy chairs with a small ottoman much better choice. Our room was also right next to a maintenance closest, a walkway & stairs. We live in LA so noise is usually not a problem, but it was pretty loud even for us. Breakfast was included and quite filling. Great coffee! I'd definitely go back & stay again, just ask for a different room.

This gave us a balcony facing the Pacific Ocean which was especially good for photographing the sunset.   And the price overall was substantially more than other similar accommodations.  Be aware this is an older facility badly in need of a complete overhaul.  The air conditioner was sadly in need of replacement making unacceptable noises, especially hard to sleep at night.  The outside grill of the air conditioner showed accumulated gray/green growth buildup.  The sliding screen on the balcony doors was broken and unusable.  Also be aware no elevator is provided so be prepared to carry your own luggage up and down the steps.  I would normally give this kind of motel a three star rating but the view of sunset was very nice from our room balcony.

Always lots of things to do or you can just kick back and relax. Staff is excellent and very knowledgable of the area and have some great suggestions. Resturant right next door and is absolutely delicious and with scenic views of the Pacific Ocean. (We watched whales play while we ate.) Nice leisure walk to the beach for some fun in the sun or stay at the hotel and swim or tan by the pool.  ENJOY!,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,FunInSunPismoBeach,Front Office Manager,2017-05-05,"Thank you for the detailed feedback about your stay.

Maura M,6,,2017-04-30,FRIENDS,2017-05-01,5,Weekend Stay @  The Shore Cliff,"Excellent and reasonably priced property if making reservations online.  I recommend the rooms on the other side of the pool.  The view is completely unobstructed and you don't hear the pool noise or the road noise.  The rooms are clean, large with a decent tv selection.  There is no direct beach access however.  A short walk down the road and then a series of stairs is required but more than worth it.  The Ventana Grill next door has a beautiful private room downstairs overlooking the ocean. The views were incredible.  n We were there attending an afternoon wedding.  A perfect venue with all guests staying at the shore cliff.  No driving required.  ",,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,,,0

The hotel is older though and it's a little loud. You can hear your neighbors moving around, doors closing, etc. and the beds could be a bit more comfortable.

kacedo34,2,"Pasadena, California",2017-04-30,COUPLES,2017-04-24,5,Exceeded my expectations,"I did a lot of research as I always do before choosing a hotel especially for a vacation. This wasn't a business trip or a conference where I wasn't going to be in my room much. This was for Spring Break and my birthday. It was going to be a relaxing, chill vacation where I was expecting to hang out a lot on the balcony with a nice view and drink so some good wine.

That's exactly what this hotel was perfect for. Beautiful room. Great price. Friendly staff. Great continental breakfast. Even the guests were friendly, yet everyone kept to themselves knowing that we're all on vacation. It was nice.

I especially liked the different places you could sit on the property. They have these great reclining swings that were relaxing and the view -- SPECTACULAR. I'm definitely returning. Plus, there's a great Mexican restaurant (Ventana Grill) just a few steps away with great Happy Hour or even get dressed up and to go out to a nice dinner with your love.

Very relaxing trip. Also, SLO (San Luis Obispo) is only about a 15 minute drive up the 101. We went for an afternoon and got some lunch.

Hotel does what it says on the tin.

Pool ok, heated.  Breakfast reasonable choice, nothing fancy but sufficient and free.  Parking free.

travellingatty,58,,2017-04-30,FAMILY,2017-04-08,4,Mostly great.  ,"The staff were incredibly nice and the room was spacious and comfortable.   The views from the rooms are spectacular.   The breakfast was probably the only disappointment--many of the cold items, such as milk, were so cold they were iced over, the orange juice dispenser was broken the whole week, and eggs and meats were often not very warm.  I ended up taking them back to room to microwave, which helped a bit.  
Do not expect direct beach access.  You have to walk over several paths to the Sea Crest three hotels down to get to the stairs to the beach.  Due to erosion, be prepared to climb  over rocks at the end of the stairs before getting to the sand.

1rmcbrl,483,"San Bernardino, California",2017-02-28,FAMILY,2017-03-27,5,Most Wonderful Experience ,"This hotel absolutely exceeded my expectations.  When I made the reservation for a partial ocean view, I was told by staff that a 2nd story room would give me a better ocean view so she would arrange for a second story. Also, I got $50 off my total bill with their promotion online for a Sunday and Monday stay.  When we arrived I was a little apprehensive with the outside (looks 1960's exterior) but when you enter the lobby the view and decor is beautiful!  They gave us fresh baked cookies and have fresh coffee and lemon water.  Staff very attentive and kind. We were given room #321 which is the middle of the hotel and a centered full ocean view.  The breakfast is a a full meal:  omelettes, sausage, fresh cut up fruit, variety bread for toast, pancakes you make yourself, oatmeal, hard boiled eggs, yogart, whole fruit, coffee and teas and a variety of 100% juices.  We sat on our balcony for hours watching several dolphin pods pass.  Hotel has swimming pool and hot tub, plus easy access to beach.  Short drive to downtown Pismo with wonderful restaurants and sweet shops.  By the way hotel is not a Best Western any more.",,,,,,,,FunInSunPismoBeach,Front Office Manager,2017-04-01,"Wow!

alifiyak14,3,,2017-03-31,FRIENDS,2017-03-27,3,Non friendly staff but amazing views!,"We did a girls weekends in Pismo Beach. The hotel is location is amazing. The views from our suite were breath taking. 
When I made my reservations for the suite I had requested an early check in. We reached the hotel around 2.15 pm and headed the front desk, the staff did not seem very friendly. Not a smile on their face. The lady helping us at the front desk told us the rooms were not yet ready for us to check in early and the gentleman next to her interrupted and told us how the check in time does not start until 3.45pm in a pretty rude manner.
We didn't have a problem if we couldn't check in early because we decided to go get ourselves a massage. We got a call back from the hotel at 4.32 pm letting us know our room was ready. 
We returned to the hotel later in the evening and checked in at the front desk. Again, no smiles nor pleasant hellos during the check in. Though the check in was fairly quick. 
The room was very comfortable. The interiors were beautiful and the beds were very comfy. The living room was big with a small kitchenette and two separate rooms. There were fantastic views from every room. 
Overall the stay was great except for the unfriendly staff.",,4.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,FunInSunPismoBeach,Front Office Manager,2017-04-01,"Thank you for taking the time to write such a detailed  review.

This is just my coffee with morning view and excellent restaurant you can walk to place....not enough to be preferred, but a good enough deal.

Michelle H,2,,2017-02-28,FAMILY,2017-03-07,3,Nice views but..,"The views from the property are gorgeous! They have a beautiful gazebo area with comfy swings you can relax and take in the view. The pool area has a view as well and vibrant colors with lots of seating. The room was updated, spacious and had a lovely balcony. 

On the other hand, the hotel says it is dog-friendly but that didn't really appear to be the case. You have to pay an extra $50 for your dog to stay (which is fine). BUT dogs are not allowed to be left in the room alone for any amount of time, they are not allowed on the grounds near the gazebo, pool, or lobby. Basically there is a 5x5 AstroTurf lawn for the dog and that is the extent of their ""dog-friendliness"". I appreciate disclosure before we reserve especially since we called and reserved the dog-friendly room. Are we supposed to leave a family member behind in the room to babysit the dog when we go out to the pool for an hour? We would have loved to have our pup out at the poolside with us. 

We were told breakfast would be hot rather than continental, but it was mostly packaged foods like cereals and breads. They did have eggs and bacon but the eggs were watery and the bacon did not taste real. 

Also, the hotel charged our cards incorrectly and overcharged. They did not notice their error and we had to call several times to have things charged correctly. 

They were also not willing to honor the change in price of the online rate at the time of booking. That is irritating. 

So, would I stay again? Yes. Although, I would find a dog sitter and I'd eat breakfast somewhere else. The grounds and rooms were beautiful enough that I'd go back despite the few issues above. 

Final note: no beach access from the property. ",,,,,,,,FunInSunPismoBeach,Front Office Manager,2017-03-10,"Thank you for your review. I am glad to hear that overall your experience was positive.

JoKnits,184,"San Francisco, California",2017-03-31,SOLO,2017-03-05,4,Solid mid-level hotel,"Stayed here one night while visiting the area.  It's a very good mid-level hotel, with some amenities above the typical mid-level hotel.

Good things:
* I found the bed and pillow to be very comfortable (I am picky about pillows).
* Breakfast is better than average - not a gourmet meal (which would not be expected) but a nice variety of fruit, breads & pastries, eggs (with salsa available!), oatmeal, pancake machine, yogurt, etc.
* Great location right on the ocean. Nice little paths and gazebo for viewing. Binoculars in your room for looking at the views.
* Lightweight robes in rooms (seersucker, nice touch).
* Nice-sized pool.
* Very friendly front desk team and efficient breakfast room team.
* Fridge and microwave in room, and little coffeemaker.

Things that could use improvement:
* Shower did not get as hot as I prefer. Warm enough to not shiver but not really hot.
* Workout room is very limited - has a universal machine that allows only about 5 exercises. Doesn't have different handles/bars for the machine. No dumbbells. The elliptical I got on was missing the padding on one arm and its electronics didn't work (couldn't adjust resistance etc.)
* No glassware in the room, just 2 plastic cups and 2 paper coffee cups. You can request from the desk. No plates or utensils, so if you bring food to microwave you'll need to get plates and utensils too.

For a room, I suggest you get a room that does not have the pool view for more privacy and quiet.

I would stay here again but would not select a pool room.","If you want privacy, don&#39;t get a pool-view room.",4.0,5.0,5.0,,,,FunInSunPismoBeach,Front Office Manager,2017-03-09,"We appreciate you taking the time to provide us with such detailed feedback about your stay.

Blake H,28,"Pinehurst, North Carolina",2017-02-28,COUPLES,2017-02-21,5,Great overall place like home,"We went here for a two night stay during a rainy period which is fine for us when we're at Pismo. The staff was friendly, the room was very clean and there were ample outlets to charge all of our gadgets which is our own personal measure of comfort. They provide an included buffet breakfast that is standard hotel fair but good with an egg and meat product that changes daily. The breakfast was well run and well staffed.   During a stormy night there was a serious power outage that lasted over an hour but within minutes of the outage, the staff had lanterns in each hallway and glow sticks lining every stairway - they were really on top of it and we actually kinda enjoyed it. If I had to find a downside it would be the box heater/AC combo in the wall that could probably use some upgrading but it wasn't a big deal for us.Overall, we felt very comfortable and right at home right away which doesn't happen very often for us and it's clear they pay attention to the simple things that make that happen. We'll return even if it's raining again. ",,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,FunInSunPismoBeach,Front Office Manager,2017-02-24,"Thank you for your positive comments.

No pay per view movies which would've been nice as I stayed during a weekend when it was storming. But I guess it's not really a necessity during summer months when you have more options to do outside the room. They also had a designated area to sit and watch the ocean with many sitting spots and a glider chair.

Strether S,12,"Cupertino, California",2017-01-31,COUPLES,2017-01-21,4,Great Location.. Nice Room.. Problems with details..,"We have stayed there twice. Both times the hotel was ""under construction/upgrade"". That was not a real problem since we were just using the room but I hope they will finish so the full facility will be available.
There were several details that were bothersome:
--The worst was the noisy and inadequate heater that should have been replaced with the room upgrade. Maybe it will be later.
--Hot water took forever to come through and was not hot enough when it came through. The delay (and wasted water) is particularly irksome in a region that is in drought.

With these exceptions, the room was fine, the view was terrific, and the breakfast was very good. We will stay again but I hope the renovations will be complete and the problems fixed. When that happens, we will give it an excellent rating

The new landscape design with seating, swing areas and view points is amazing, the rooms are spotless clean and beautifully done and the staff friendly and helpful. On this stay we did not get breakfast because we were lazy and just enjoyed coffee on our balcony (while we took in the views with the complimentary binocculars they provide) but we have had breakfast in the past and it was always fresh and provided many choices.

Pool must have been heated because it was mid fifty outside and there were people swimming. Both pool and jacuzzi were clean.

Kristin T,12,"San Diego, California",2016-12-31,FAMILY,2016-12-30,2,Stunningly bad experience ,"I travel often for business and pleasure and I had the worst experience that I can ever recall at this hotel.  A reviewer on Trip advisor had warned that this hotel was significantly under construction so I knew to ask for a room away from that.  Not only were we put in a room directly (directly!  Literally!  The construction zone fence stopped right outside the door to the room) next to the construction but as a woman traveling alone with two kids I was also shocked to be on the ground floor.  I believe most in the hotel industry know to usually put a woman traveling alone on a less accessible floor, I've actually never been put on the first floor.  In any case the hotel was seemingly deserted with very few reservations so after discussing with the man that checked me in 2 times (!!!) we got moved to the second floor of the building I requested in the first place.  And wow what a shock to find that room has already been upgraded....entirely different than the smelly dated room next to construction.  Why weren't we put there in the first place?  I asked to be there due to the construction and it would have been a much better representation of their hotel that may have led to me being a repeat (rather than angry and shocked) customer.  
The kids and I laughed when we woke to early morning construction the next day...it was loud enough as it was in our room, it would have been so horrific had we been in our original room.
I'm still shocked by how the man that checked us in treated us/me.  It was like we were being punked.",,,,,,,,FunInSunPismoBeach,Front Office Manager,2016-12-31,"Thank you for your review.

But why would you build an ocean front hotel in a way that many rooms that have the ocean view have a section of the hotel blocking their view of the sunset? From the highway the hotel looked like all rooms would ave a sunset view but inside the room we were disappointed not to be able to see the sunset. Probably the building was built to maximize the rooms available but the lack of sunset view was a disappointment . On check out I found that there were ADA rooms with a sunset view so the moral of the story is ask specific questions when you are making a reservation 😀😀 Still, it was a good value!",,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,FunInSunPismoBeach,Front Office Manager,2016-12-04,"Thank you for giving us your feedback about your stay. Yes we do have 3 different room views available. We offer our ocean views (which consists of looking over the pool area, ocean and can see the sunset), pier side views (which you can look down south into the Pismo Beach area, the pier and watching the waves crash along the beach) and ocean front views (which you can look down both the north and south coast of the pacific and see an awesome view of the sunset). We hope you will come back and visit us again in the near future.

TiggsGlasgow,44,,2016-11-30,COUPLES,2016-11-29,4,Great Stay - Just Wish It'd Been Longer,"We only stayed here one night as part of our California road trip and wish we'd been able to stay longer.  The room was comfortable and had a sink, fridge and microwave.  The bathroom also had a double sink ie one each.  We were on a timescale, but we'd wished we'd had longer as the swimming pool area looked great and the view from the hotel amazing.  There was also a jacuzzi, which we wished we'd had the time to try.  Breakfast was included and included fruit, yoghurt, toast, pancakes, oatmeal and some hot stuff.  It was refreshing not to have to pay valet parking, which we'd been hammered for at our previous and subsequent other locations.  Staff were also really friendly.  Would definitely recommend.",,,3.0,4.0,3.0,,,FunInSunPismoBeach,Front Office Manager,2016-12-03,"Thank you so much for taking the time to write such a great review about us for all future travelers to read.

mini,130853,"Fremont, California",2016-11-30,SOLO,2016-11-16,4,Another Nice Stay - However Major Renovation Going On,"I had a good stay at the Best Western in Pismo Beach. The swimming pool which overlooks the Pacific Ocean is very nice.  The spa is very nice.

Since it gets dark early in November, I opted for a partial ocean view (instead of ocean front which is slightly higher in price.).  The room was nice. The bed was comfortable.  There is a refrigerator, microwave, and coffee/tea maker.   The bathroom is nice with dual sinks.

Breakfast was good with a variety of hot and cold items.   

Service is with a smile. There were sugar cookies also on arrival.

So, for the areas I used it was very good.

The Best Western in Pismo Beach right now is going through major renovation.  The hard working team is doing a good job of upgrading the place.  They were also very respectful of sleeping hours.  

For the rating I have rated it very good (however - I would ask about the status of the remodel when booking.  To many, it would be an average stay currently.  Since we have stayed there numerous times, I am staying with my very good rating. 

They were nice enough to give me a call after I booked to explain the remodeling and how to check in.  So service I have rated very good as well as location.  The ocean front location is superb.",,4.0,5.0,,5.0,,,FunInSunPismoBeach,Front Office Manager,2016-11-22,"I am delighted to hear that we have been part of so many journeys that you've taken.

This hotel has very nice balconies that overlook the ocean. It was overcast when we were here, so our time on the balcony was limited. We still enjoyed the size of the room. This is an older property that is being refurbished, but the views are great. Just know that there is not a beach outside of the hotel. There are many birds, including pelicans and gulls, on the cliffs by the hotel. If the tide is low, you will get a definite sea/fish smell. The sunset was beautiful! The room was clean and well-appointed. The best part of this hotel is the breakfast. It offers eggs, meat, pancakes, fruit, cottage cheese, and many breakfast breads/pastries.

I’d like to start by stating that we were on a road trip with this location being the middle part of our journey.  1 of my party has an allergy to feathers so we had to contact all the hotels (6 in total) in advance to ensure the rooms were prepared.  This hotel was the only hotel to respond to our emails and for that I am grateful.  

Check in was easy and Jon who was behind the desk on the day offered great recommendations on how to spend our day.  Many thanks to him and his outstanding customer service.   

The hotel boasted free parking and also a complimentary breakfast which saved us a few dollars in comparison to other hotels.  
The room was extremely spacious and was complimented with a small kitchen, microwave, safe and boasted a massive bathroom and extremely comfortable king bed.  The room also offered a balcony over the pool area and a partial view of the sea front which was unexpected but welcome.

LetsGoRedSox_9,57,,2016-10-31,FAMILY,2016-10-05,4,Unexpected pleasure,"Is this the nicest Best Western anywhere?  I don't know.  I guess I don't stay at many Best Westerns.  My main BW memories seem to be as roadside motels where my family would stay whenever we moved.  As a child all I cared about in a hotel/motel was whether the place had a pool.  Now my standards have changed. My son lives in San Luis Obispo and we've stayed at some hotels there but we wanted to be at the beach during this visit and have stayed at this BW once before.  The location is amazing, right on the cliff overlooking the ocean, with a view of Pismo Beach to the south.  We had a two-bedroom suite, which had three balconies overlooking the ocean.  We could easily hear the ocean from our bedrooms.  The unit was clean, although there were a few stains on the carpet.  The unit had a mini-kitchen which included a refrigerator, microwave, and coffee maker (Keurig-style). Each bedroom, as well as the living room had a flat-screen television.  The living room sofa was a pull-out bed. There was one bathroom, with two separate sink areas so more than one person could use the bathroom are at one time. The internet access was free and seemed pretty fast.  Parking was free.  The breakfast was fine - scrambled eggs, oatmeal, toast, bagels, etc. Our group also had a separate room which also overlooked the ocean.  It looked as if it had recently been renovated.   This BW has a beautiful pool overlooking the ocean.  It looks like something out of a fancy resort.  They even provide pool towels. The hotel shares a parking lot with the Ventana Grill which has good food but make sure you make a reservation.",,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,86

We'd just had a shoddy accommodation experience at another Best Western further north so this was a welcome relief. We had a two bedroom suite right at the front. Great space for two adults and 3 kids. Clean and well maintained with comfy beds. Stunning views from all three balconies. Yes, the smell from the roosting Pelicans is a bit whiffy but the scenery more than compensates. The kids loved the pool!

There is also free parking available should you need it. 
Pretty much all of the rooms here overlook the bay, which is great, there is furniture on the balconies for you to sit back and relax. 
The facilities in the room were good - fridge, coffee machine, safe etc. 
The room itself is of an average quality, very liveable. The only problem was the hot tap - which smelt of egg everytime you turned it on! 
The breakfast (which is included) is good for variety however we found a big blonde hair in one of our omelette's (neither of us are blonde), this put us off from returning the next morning! 

All in all, it was a nice stay, just a shame about the tap and breakfast. If I returned to Pismo, I would probably reside in a different hotel (given the price for this one - which wasn't cheap!!).",,,4.0,,5.0,,3.0,,,,,40
Batch1e,13,,2016-10-31,COUPLES,2016-10-03,2,Not Good,"This was the worst and most expensive hotel experience during our 3 weeks travelling California. The room we had was nothing like the pictures advertised and when asked about an upgrade, was told we had one of the best rooms in the hotel, Really !!!(Room 0127). I do not expect to pay £193 a night and then eat breakfast on paper plates with plastic knives and forks.

No restaurant or snack facilities on site, only vending machines.
 
The water was running very slowly from the bathroom sink on our first evening at the hotel and the next morning the sink was full of brown foul smelling water. While a member of maintenance was quickly on scene, his response was "" these are old pipes she and it happens quite often. No apology and no compensation or even acknowledgement on checkout.  

We have had far better hotels at Santa Barbara, Monterey, Oceanside, Costa Mesa and San Diego for a lot less money and with the same and better facilities. 

What I would say is the pool area is excellent and the cliff top location wonderful for sunsets and bird watching. However a heavy price to pay for 2 nights and will be recommending this hotel. ",,,,,,,,,,,,8

Good amenities and friendly, helpful reception staff. The hotel was convenient for highway 1 access on our way to LA. There was a heated pool and spa pool outside good to relax in at the end of the day.. The Pelicans were rather noisy and a little smelly when near the cliff top, but this is nature. There was a lovely walk along the cliff top. Pismo beach was a walk downhill but a lovely little centre. Car parking was available but I think it was all to pay for. Lots to see there.
We had a good choice of things for a hot or cold breakfast each morning in a self service breakfast room. 
We used the restaurant next door for our 2 evening meals. A good price, choice and good food. Again good views out over the bay. We really enjoyed our stay.

Tend to stay at Hilton's and Marriott's. Have'nt stayed here since the mid-80's. Family was coming here for a few nights and I decided to join them. I wasn't expecting what I found. From the outside, generally speaking, it looks like it did back in the 80's. But after closer inspection, its been refreshed, with updated railings, and overall great condition. Upon check in Tina helped me. She was pleasant, and informed me the room would not be ready for a bit, it was only 1pm. So I went to my parents room and enjoyed the view up and down the beach and coves until about 4 when I went back to check if my room was ready. They forgot to call me. The rooms have been nicely updated with tile floors, granite counters, comfy beds, flat screen TV's, new sliding doors and look like a much newer property. The whole place is maintained so well. The pool deck was redone over the years, the outside area looks like it is almost all redone. The staff is so friendly and professional. From housekeeping to maintenance, they appear to love working there, and it makes it feel like a more expensive higher end resort. I've stayed at 5 star resorts where the staff isnt half as friendly or professional. I was sad to leave after only 2 nights. Saturday was booked, so we had to.

Very easy access to everything, we walked the beach to the main Pismo pier and beyond. The lodge takes every advantage of the location. The grounds are impeccable, lobby inviting with coffee, tea, water and newspapers available to enjoy in the beautifully decorated sitting area. 

Rooms were gorgeous, our room (looks like all rooms face the ocean) on the 3rd floor had a great view and we could sleep to the sounds of the waves. Wonderful bed. Premium linens, towels and very large room with dual bathroom sinks (that was such a great surprise). We had picked up a bottle of wine and needed some glasses, the front desk was happy to help -wine glasses were taken up to our room as we enjoyed the beautiful gazebo overlooking the ocean for some whale watching. 

Breakfast was very busy but a very good selection of hot food and standard cereals etc. It was more than enough for us and we are on a Paleo diet. Coffee was very good although they should have more as it ran out quickly.

The staff is exceptional and goes the extra mile to make you feel at home and taken care of-excellent!

Amandella,128,"Twickenham, United Kingdom",2016-08-31,FAMILY,2016-08-16,4,"Beautiful views, great service, OK hotel","We stayed at the BW Shore Cliff Lodge for 2 nights in a queen/queen room recently on a family road trip.  When we arrived, the 2 guys on reception were lovely - really helpful and although our room wasn't yet ready, they were very welcoming indeed.  We went for a walk and admired the amazing views - truly wonderful - along with the pelicans right on the property - fab.  We noticed that there was a LOT of building work going on one side of the building right in front of the rooms.  So when we returned and were told our room was ready, we checked that it wasn't on that block but were told it was!  My husband requested a different room and the receptionist went off to check with the manager and magically, we were allocated a different room on the total opposite side of the building (still ocean facing as I think most of them are)....but with uninterrupted views of the coastline.  Whilst we were delighted to see the view from our new room - it does beg the question as to why they were allocating rooms initially overlooking the building site which honestly was very loud - diggers/drilling etc going on right in front of the rooms which we would have been in!  I have a feeling we'd been given the best room in the place as a result of total luck that we'd been for a wonder...so why hold that room back?

Anyway, the room itself was clean, large and functional.  Very comfortable beds and the view was to die for.  The aircon units are a bit noisy to my husband didn't sleep well (we all had ear plus except him!)...  the free breakfast was good - although the dining room is very small for the number of guests so you have to wait for a table.  

If you get a good rate for this hotel and a reasonable room then the view itself is worth staying there for.  We enjoyed Pismo itself - it has some nice restaurants (The Cracked Crab was excellent) and a nice relaxed vibe.

The day before we arrived we got a phone call from the hotel saying there was loud construction happening at the property but that it shouldn't affect us since it was going to be the weekend. What they didn't tell us was that our $300 plus a night room would have a view of a storage container and other construction fencing etc. The next morning we asked to be moved and to their credit they did, to the room directly above where we were. The picture provided shows the view from that room. In our move we left our phone charger in our first room and we realized a couple of hours later.

I had spent quite a bit of time researching places to stay in Pismo Beach without much luck. There just seemed to be a load of overpriced motels and a couple of very expensive hotels. I settled on the Best Western simply because of the pool, sea view and reviews that it was clean and had free wifi. 

Although the front of the building is dated, overall the hotel is clean, rooms fairly modern and staff friendly. The breakfasts were decent also. I would recommend paying a little extra for an ocean view. It is child friendly and worth using on the basis you aren't expecting a 5 star palace.

tmccaleb,170,"Tallahassee, Florida",2016-06-30,FAMILY,2016-07-03,2,Great Views but Somewhat Worn and Tired,"The hotel is located right on the water, on the cliffs above the Pacific. However, at the present time and scheduled to continue into 2017, the cliffs are being reconstructed so only a small portion of the hotels cliffside property is accessible to guests. We had a two bedroom suite which looked out on the ocean and was outside the construction zone. Other rooms appeared to look onto the construction zone. The suite was large and mostly satisfactory, but the hotel exhibits wear and is in need of renovation, especially, for example, the carpets. There is a restaurant on the property, but it is expensive and specializes in Latin cuisine, which is not to my liking, and there are no others nearby. The town is not within walking distance, about two miles away I'd guess. Breakfast was fairly typical of this level of hotel, pretty basic. We chose it because the room arrangement worked for us, traveling with my sister-in-law, but on a future visit, I'd check out the alternatives more closely.","Definitely, oceanside for the views--at least after shore renovation is completed.",,3.0,4.0,5.0,,,FunInSunPismoBeach,Front Office Manager,2016-07-04,"Thank you for your review.

When I booked the room I was not told anything about the construction but I asked for a south facing room which was the least impacted of the all rooms .... I'm glad I stayed in this section. I was called to tell me of the construction a couple days prior so there was no surprise but I'm not sure if I could have cancelled or where to go last minute as this town fills up regularly.

Our room was nice and roomy with a nice bath with granite double sink; shower/tub; in room safe; good size closet, nice tv, table and chair; a/c (we used since a little warm); nice like new kitchenette with frig, sink, microwave, cabinets and shelf, coffee maker. The rooms have free WiFi in rooms but I wasn't told so didn't know until next morning. Lots of great amenities and we had great south view of beach and pier and a small public area with only construction being setting stones the day we were there.

Our balcony was good sized and had tall wooden chairs with a foot rest so you can see over the railing and not through the rails. Very nice, comfortable and relaxing.

Breakfast was in a nice good sized room with a good selection of food: pancake machine, eggs and bacon, Danish, juices and coffee, some fruit, toaster with breads and oatmeal.

Everyone is the hotel was nice and friendly and helpful with questions about dinner choices. 

We paid $230 which seemed high for a weekday night but it's a nice hotel. 

The views from the gazebo on the edge of the cliff are great where we watched pelicans, western gulls with their new chicks, and sea otters.

Ask for details on where your room will be until the construction is done (told mid-2017) and until then I'd ask for south facing room away from biggest projects.",,,,,,,,FunInSunPismoBeach,Front Office Manager,2016-06-30,"Thank you so much for taking the time to write such a great review about us for all future travelers to read.

We had a swim in the pool when we arrived and that was nice. Pool towels are supplied by the motel. The hotel it self had good standards but the whole garden with sea views was closed for construction work which was a real disappointment being one of the ´criteria for choosing the hotel.

russandmarti,164,"Albany, California",2016-06-30,COUPLES,2016-06-22,3,So Close to Excellent...,"Dog friendly, not just dog tolerant.  

Large rooms with extremely comfortable beds.  Frig. Microwave.  Wet bar.  Really nice choice of free breakfast items.  Friendly staff.

Superb view.

Why not four or more stars?

Reason 1:  We called the property to make our reservation and explicity said we chose them due to their dog friendly property.  The did warn us construction was going on.  When we checked in we found out that what they failed to tell us was their own dog park was being relandscaped and not available.  Seriously bummed.  Nor did they point out there was an awesome green space for dogs just down the road

Reason 2:  exactly 1 paper coffee cup in the room, no more. Really cheap plastic cups in bathroom not suitable for much of anything.  Noise from other rooms is very loud.  This is a construction problem, not a neighbor problem.  Cheap, cheap, cheap.

n w,27,,2016-06-30,COUPLES,2016-06-21,2,So disappointed:(,"Ambitious CA road trip, scheduled for two nights in Pismo beach to relax and recharge.  After full day of sightseeing arrived at 830 pm at Best Western Cliff Lodge to find a hotel under construction.  Checking in, the desk stated that they had called us to inform customers of renovations, the call, however, had been to a home number and we were already on the road.  They assured us our room was on the opposite side from construction.  Our ocean view room was very nice however we pulled back the drapes to find our ocean view just a background to the landscaping crew with cement mixers and other equipment. The hall door at the end of our room's corridor was closed due to construction. And the entire garden area outside the main lobby was closed with backhoes and construction crews.  While the staff at the front desk were pleasant and tried to be accommodating, I was very disappointed and indeed angry at the misrepresentation on line.  When booking there is one line which states: coastal renovations in process adjacent to hotel, disruptions expected to be minimal.  These renovations are not adjacent, they included the entire hotel nor was the disruption minimal, with multiple access restrictions, backhoes and  entire construction crews on site. 

I have been using Best Westerns successfully across the country and have been impressed by the mid-level hotel in numerous locations. In fact, after reviewing multiple hotels on line, I picked this hotel because it was a Best Western and I've had such success with the chain...until now. The staff assured me that each Best Western is individually owned and managed which makes this misrepresentation the responsibility of this hotels management and may not reflect on the entire chain but certainly gives a black eye to the chain.

The staff, very much aware of this misrepresentation, willingly offered to greatly reduce the nights cost and we checked out after one night, moving two doors down to the beautiful Seacrest hotel who allowed us to check in early and saved our Pismo beach stay.","Don&#39;t trust on-line photos, they are pre-construction!",1.0,3.0,,,3.0,,FunInSunPismoBeach,Front Office Manager,2016-06-25,"On behalf of our entire team, I would like to apologize for not exceeding your expectations.

That afternoon while sitting our on our balcony, we saw whales. Most exciting! Our beds were extremely comfortable. The room was immaculate with a great little kitchen area. The bathroom provided nice quality towels with top of the line bath products. Even though the grounds were being worked on, it was never noisy and the workers were very polite and accommodating. Room service was excellent. The maids were exceptional leaving the room in top condition every day. Also, ALL employees they we had contact with had a smile on their faces.  Nice variety of breakfast food with hot and cold items. Immaculate kitchen.  Within walking distance, we were fortunate to have a great restaurant close by.

donna_d173,29,,2016-05-31,FAMILY,2016-05-28,4,"Good experience, a few problems but overall pretty great time at BW PLUS Shore Cliff Lodge","My dad and I stayed at the BW Plus Shore Cliff Lodge in late May 2016. There was construction going on but we were forewarned by the hotel with a phonecall before our trip. It was not anywhere as noisy as I thought it would be, although huge construction vehicles went past our patio on a daily basis while we were there. I wasn't that bothered by it and my dad was fascinated. We stayed in a 1st floor room which was very convenient. The view was great for the most part although construction fence obscured some of it. There was a smoking area where my dad could smoke his cigars in peace, always something we look for on our trips. Two problems we had were: 1. the coffee machine in the room. It was a cheap one and I couldn't figure out how to use it. 2. The shower. It was extremely low flow, don't know if they were trying to save water or if something was truly wrong with it but we could barely get enough water out of it to take a shower. Otherwise things were generally great. Good breakfast with lots of choices although no cold cereal but eggs, bacon, pancakes, hot cereal, yogurt toast, bagels, etc. etc. Could go and get coffee for the room around 6:15, breakfast started at 7am til 10am. Room was very nice, updated, beds extremely comfortable. Nice desk and 3 chairs in the room. It was a bit noisy from upstairs, could hear people walking around and making noise on the floor above but not unreasonably so. Wifi worked great which is always appreciated. Hotel staff were very friendly and accommodating. Complementary newspapers every morning. We didn't walk to town but I suppose you could if you were up to it, but a close and easy drive. Hotel parking easy. We were able to check in early which was nice. The pool was excellent, heated and wonderful in an otherwise cold and windy environment...it is much bigger than it looks in photos. Hot tub a plus too. Overall a very good place to stay and despite the problematic coffee machine in room plus low flow shower, we would stay here again in the future! Also, not sure about this but it looks like there are no elevators at this hotel, you must walk up flights of stairs to get to your room, at least in the 2 floor building. You should ask about the 3 floor building and elevators if you are going to stay there, didn't check that out as we stayed in the ground floor in the 2 floor building. Pet friendly. We didn't have pets and the pets didn't bother us, no extra barking or whatever from four legged guests! Couldn't go down to the gazebo as it was roped off due to construction or some other problem. Would like to go back when construction is done but looks like a big job, will take some time before this is all complete.",Choose 1st floor in 2 story building if you don&#39;t want to have to drag your suitcases up flight of stairs to 2nd floor.,,4.0,5.0,,,4.0,,,,,17

slpion,44,"Madison, Wisconsin",2016-05-31,FAMILY,2016-05-18,3,"If you have children, beware","So happy the hotel was able to accommodate an early check in. My husband and I were with our two toddler when we unpacked the suitcases into our room, Room 203 at 11am on a Friday. Just as we had finished unpacking and organizing, our phone rang. It was the front desk saying they had ALREADY received a noise complaint from the people below us. We had to repack everything and move to the room next door, which was directly above the room my sister and her fiance had rented. Not at all awkward that we were in town for their wedding and staying directly above them on their wedding night. The floors are incredibly thin, so you could hear everything going on above you. The front desk did call, the lady called giggling and apologizing that we had to move and then said we would be credited $50 for our inconvenience. 

The breakfast selection was nice. 

Housekeeping never came and cleaned our room so that was a bit inconvenient. 

After we checked out and drove back to LA, my husband noticed he had left behind his custom made brace. When I called the hotel, it was a HUGE hassle. Apparently only one person has access to the lost and found and that person wasn't available. As a person who worked as a manager at in hotel business for several years (a Best Western none the less) I knew that was not accurate. So someone did call me back to let me know they had found it but we not able to ship it. We would need to drive back to PB to pick it up. Terrible customer service.  

In the end, they dropped it off at Mail Plus and we paid for it to be shipped to us. 

Since we paid for the hotel room in cash, we are still waiting for that $50 credit. Would have been a better show of customer service if the hotel would have just offered to pay for the shipping in lieu of the $50 we will never see...

Walton S,7,"San Diego, California",2016-05-31,FAMILY,2016-05-16,5,Great place to stay with dogs,"My wife and I like to take California road trips with our dogs. We've driven past Pismo many times and thought 'that looks nice' but never stopped. Wow, were we ever missing something! 
This Best Western is perched on a cliff overlooking the Pacific. Any time you can fall asleep listening to the ocean is good. There is a narrow pathway in front of several of the nearby properties, right on the edge of the cliffs that is perfect for walking. 
We visited Pismo, Avila, Shell Beach and Grover Beach.
Our motel was clean, it had large rooms all overlooking the ocean. Pool and jacuzzi, swinging lounge chairs on the lawn, charge points for electric cars, and is pet friendly (like every Best Western EXCEPT LA, why is that?)",,,,,,,,FunInSunPismoBeach,General Manager,2016-05-30,"Thank you for staying with us.

But since they remodeled they allow no pets so we found the Shore Cliff Lodge took pets so we spent 3 nights there.  What a pleasant experience. We had a first floor ( good if you have pets ) and  had a great view of the ocean and beach from our window/patio. The room was quite spacious and had a table with two chairs plus another comfortable chair for watching TV. The bathroom was also spacious- even had two sinks. The king bed was very comfortable and firm enough for my back problems so that I awoke in the morning with no backache . Our stay included breakfast- we had yummy scrambled eggs, sausage, muffin and coffee. The staff was very friendly and eager to make our stay comfortable. I gave it a 4 rating since it is a bit pricey and, although not any fault of their own, they have soft water in Arroyo Grande and you feel that you can never get the soap off your skin when you shower.

Sorry but this is my review and my opinion.  I prefer to stay at 4 star hotels.

The view was fabulous, the staff was great, the room is very large.  The countertops have been updated to granite and the bathroom was clean.  However, the carpet is nasty and has rolls in it and the sheets are pilled and need to be trashed.  I almost rated this hotel 2 stars, but since breakfast and the view were great I thought it unfair.

The pool area and breakfast area were very clean.  And staff was smiling and constantly cleaning up after everyone.

If you have a partial ocean view overlooking thru the pool, don't miss out by walking thru the breakfast area and out the south door.  The grassy area over there has the most beautiful and serene view and is a perfect place to eat breakfast.

I would prefer never to sleep in a bed like this again.  Ever.  Sheets and bedding really need to be replaced.",,,5.0,,5.0,2.0,,FunInSunPismoBeach,General Manager,2016-03-16,"Hello,

First the positive...the view is incredible!  They have balconies that have higher chairs so you are not looking at the breathtaking view through bars.  Nice touch!  The rooms are good size.  They have a self-serve window washer in the parking lot (like you would find in a gas station) which was very welcomed after a long and buggy drive there.  If you have a dog, there is a nice grassy area with views (of the ocean and pier) for your dog to frolic while you enjoy.  Seating is out there too.  The breakfast was pretty good.  Some choices not to my liking in quality and taste, but others quite good like fresh fruit, good coffee, and Chobani yogurt.

Now the negatives...we noticed what looked like dog yak on the carpet.  Housekeeping came out the next day and cleaned it when we let the front desk know.  There is no beach access like many places along the coast.  And our biggest issue is that the wifi is practically non-existent.  When I am traveling with my son, we don't go out at night, so we like to stream videos in the evening for entertainment.  We couldn't even surf the web!  

So if you don't care about beach access or wifi, this might be a good place to stay.  Otherwise, keep looking because there are better choices.",,,,,,,,,,,,105

lminhoe,84,"Singapore, Singapore",2015-12-31,FAMILY,2016-02-16,4,Stopover at the BW Shore Cliff Lodge,"Stopped for a night at the Shore Cliff Lodge between Camarillo and Monterey. I have mixed feelings about this place, mostly about unfulfilled potential. Firstly, it fronts a rugged coast which boasts gorgeous views of the Pacific and secondly, it's a good stop for travellers between LA and Monterey on CA1. But the look and feel of the accommodations are more like a motel than a resort. If its offerings were more refined, it could even be a destination resort on its own. That said, there are still a fair number of positives about Shore Cliff Lodge:
- affable and helpful staff at reception
- breakfast included, albeit basic spread
- lovely views of the coast, although some of the paths were closed for construction at the time of visit
- clean, spacious rooms but tired-looking (the corridors were narrow and sound proofing of rooms from the noise along the corridors wasn't great)
In summary, Shore Cliff Lodge is a good place for a short, convenient stopover. Would I linger for wine watching the sunset from my room? Probably not.",,,,,,,,,,,,111

The rooms are a slight let down as they could really do with some renovation as they look like something from the mid 80's but can't complain too much as the view makes up for that.
The downside of pismo is that there are very few hotels and one company owns this and 4 near bye so they virtually have a monopoly and therefore all the rooms are rather expensive for what you get.
Lovely little touch was that they had a make your own hot chocolate station in the lobby in the evening.
Asked the woman at the reception desk if she could recommend a restaurant nearby there was one right next door to the hotel that had a 2 hour wait for a table or the next nearest was a mile walk down the road which is poorly lit and with busy traffic made us feel unsafe.

The first night the ocean waves roared in; the second night they were more gentle.  Both nights we had a delightful sleep.

We saw a beautiful sunset from the balcony of our room.  Since they are working on the coastal trail thourgh the area, there was some construction going on in the grassy aresa.  The simming pool and jacuzzi were both delightful.

In terms of breakfast, we had a good breakfast in their larger dining, room.  They have pancakes, cereal and oatmeal, scrambled eggs, bacon, rolls, toast, juice, coffee and more.  Staff kept the place well stocked.  The surf boards on the wall are a nice touch.  There is a TV in the breakfast room.

We also liked it that we could walk and have dinner at a superb restaurant - just to the north of it called  Ventana Grill.  The restaurant has nice views of the ocean as well.

In terms of the room, we had a king size room, comfortable cough, nice desk area, and good lighting.  We also had a shelf area to put up our Valentine's Cards.

Service was great.  When we returned from our day out on Valentine's Day, there was a box of candy on our bed.  So nice and special.

Mamasidd,9,,2015-10-31,COUPLES,2016-01-13,3,Good location for exploring the area,"My husband and I visited BWP Shore Cliff Lodge in October for an intended get-away from road construction noise near our home. We arrived a little bit early and were grateful that our room was ready. My husband had just laid down to take a quick nap when we heard the all-too-familiar ""beep, beep, beep"" of a truck backing up. Sure enough, there was a construction project in process right beneath our balcony. I only wish reception had let us know so we could have changed our reservation before hand.

That being said, we were on the second floor (room 213 if I remember right). The view was lovely especially since the surf was up and the tide high. Our room was comfortable enough, bed quality fair. Placement of lights were not too conducive for reading (but then again, I need high light for my eyes). I loved having the balcony door open a crack to allow for the sea breeze and natural noise of the ocean.

Shore Cliff Lodge is conveniently located near town. We enjoyed a journey a little further south to Arroyo Grande for dinner and shopping one day and north to Avila Beach for breakfast and a stroll along shore line. Many people rave about Ventana's next door, however, we were not too impressed. I can see why people staying elsewhere might come for the view of the sunset, but we had a perfect view from our room. We gave it a 3 out of 5 star rating.

One day, we took an excursion to Pismo Beach to drive on the sand. We both had always wanted to to that. Be warned if you decide to do this, that it's easy to get stuck in the sand and costs about $300 to get towed out--more if the tide has come in. We were unaware but can tell you first hand, it is not cheap. Fun nonetheless.

This probably isn't a great place for a romantic getaway, but it is adequate and a good location for exploring the area.",Great views from second floor in building behind reception desk.,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,,FunInSunPismoBeach,Guest Services Associate,2016-02-04,"Thank you for choosing Best Western Plus Shore Cliff Lodge and for taking the time to write a review, we really appreciate your input!

There isn't any beach access because it sits on a shoreline composed of sheer cliffs. Excellent unobstructed ocean sunset views, a nice restaurant/lounge next door with the same views. The rooms are very nice but I had a ground floor room that had a connecting door that must have been made out of paper, so I would suggest you ask for a ""non-connecting room"" unless you want to hear the hair dryer blasting away in the adjoining room.

ZiadNila,147,"Port of Spain, Trinidad",2015-08-31,COUPLES,2016-01-09,4,Decent stay; Good vantage from property,"Overall: 
We chose this hotel for the view, location and the overall vibe that we had while doing our research. Had some really high hopes, maybe too much. Most of what I anticipated came to fruition except maybe the views from our room was a big disappointment. In hindsight I would not have paid any extra for such as room. Overall the hotel offered all that is needed or expected from such an establishment and even surprised in some areas where we did not expect. It was large, spacious and modern enough. The only thing to note which I should have been aware of is that there are mostly families here at this hotel and therefore the noise level is extremely high, lots of kids running around kicking a rumpus. Be cautious about rooms close to the pool area. There are however spots that could be potentially quiet like the lookout and gazebo area.
Location:
This property is perched on the cliffs overlooking the Ocean and with Pismo beach to the South, the view from the grounds and overall feel outside on the property is wonderful. There is a nice few restaurants nearby, a particularly great one (Ventana Grill) almost on the same property. The property is fairly large, parking quite ample. The Hotel is comprised of two main buildings, one housing rooms and the breakfast room and the other with Rooms (I think) and the Reception area, the pool is in between these two buildings. Our room was supposed to be a room with a view, we were in the building with the breakfast room. From the hotel, and I presume like any other hotel in the area for that matter, the main town is very close and everything is pretty centralized. 
Service & Staff: 
This was basic and meet most needs, check in and out was easy and convenient. We had a problem on one night where we went to use the coffee maker and realized room service did not clean properly as the last user left their coffee remnants in the machine and it marinated there for however long I am unsure. It was unsightly but they came and dealt with it. 
Room, Cleanliness & Sleep: 
I was disappointed with the aforementioned coffee debacle which meant proper and thorough cleaning was not done, given that we checked in very late means that suitable time was available to prepare the room this suggested lacking attention to detail. Most importantly was my supposed room with a view. This view was more so blocked by the previously mentioned main building and therefore the sunset which was sold to me at check-in was only partially, my view was more of the noisy pool area. We were on the second floor just overlooking the pool so this was not a good spot in hindsight. The room was however spacious beyond norms for hotels of this type and I found the bed and bathroom to be also quite large. Bathroom had his and hers face basins and quite spacious so two people could occupy at the same time. Rest was comfortable as the bedding was good. There was a nice balcony to relax outside though the chairs left much to be desired.  
Amenities: 
The property had most amenities such as larger than expected gym, large breakfast room, large pool area, nice grounds and walkways to attempt a get away from noisy and unruly kids. The reception and guest services area was large and had evening coffee and tea. We made use of a useful and welcome self-service laundry for which guest services had the necessary detergents etc for sale. This was a great help as we did not expect this and our next stop would have required some laundry. Overall everything was placed such that there did not seem to be a large demand and limited supply; there was enough for everyone. One silly thing which irked me was that there was no remote for the A unit in the room, which meant when it was too hot or too cold asleep or awake you had to make your way over to the unit to adjust it accordingly; kind of archaic. 

Price & Value: 
Generally, we were pleased with our choices, the hotel met most expectations. Had I the opportunity again I would not book a room with a view or place an emphasis on this as the best views are from the lounge chairs on the grounds anyway and some rooms have partial views at best so it’s up to luck which one you get. Rooms fronting the grounds facing the ocean could potentially be winners. For around 240.00 US per night I was a bit disappointed as I hyped up this leg of our stay with relaxing vistas and therefore paid for this but I guess everything else was good. I would recommend to someone, and I would stay here again but if I am getting a room with a view it better really be a view and I don’t want to be near to the pool area.",Avoid rooms close to the pool due to noise and also ensure your view is not a partial one.,,3.0,4.0,5.0,,,,,,,44

Chris M,145,"Simi Valley, California",2015-11-30,COUPLES,2016-01-01,5,Perfect for a Wedding,"We fell in love with the setting for our wedding last November.  Wedding venue on the cliff is part of the Shore Cliff Lodge, but the wedding venue and reception was run by the Ventana Grill next door.

We wanted the bride and groom to share separate rooms, and we also had our kids and grand kids with us so we enquired if they had a couple suites which they did.  It turns out they have (6) 2 bedroom suites, and you can choose the first, second, or third floors.  All suites have an awesome view of the ocean and balconies where you can sit and watch the sunset if you want.  We reserved our suites in May to make sure we secured them and chose the bottom floor which would be safer for our grandkids.  The rooms ran $349 each which was pricey, but considering they had two bedrooms and could sleep our families comfortably, the price is not too bad considering they are right there on the cliff overlooking the water.

The lobby is clean and decorative and would also serve as the launch point for our wedding party.  The two suites we chose we located down a hallway from the breakfast area (included) which served scrambled eggs, bacon, potatoes, toast, cereal, pancakes, juices and coffee.  The facility also had wifi which worked great.

Arriving at our suites we opened the door and found them to be large and included a small kitchen area (including a fridge, microwave, small stove), a living room with flatscreen TV, a porch which overlooks either the pool or the beach (depending which side your suite is on), two bedrooms, a bathroom with a sink, and an adjoining area with a sink and mirror (perfect for the morning when the wedding party will be getting ready).  One bedroom had a queen sixed bed, the other bedroom had two double beds.  In the living room there was a couch which pulled out into a queen bed, and two comfortable chairs.  So the suite could sleep up to 8 people.

The bride and groom wedding party settled in after dinner and watched the sunset.  It was a sunny day and sunset was spectacular.  The next day we awoke, had breakfast, then started getting ready for the wedding at 1:00.  On the lawn near the gazebo we had an arch set up as well as chairs, flowers, DJ, etc.  I made my way to the lobby with my daughter who was my best ""man,"" and then proceeded down the lawn with music to the arch to meet the minister.  The bridesmaids and flower children followed, then the beautiful bride.  It was beautiful, and we both shed tears.  After the ceremony the wedding party made their way to the Ventana Grill for the reception.  

The Ventana Grill has a full room overlooking the cliff which is perfect for receptions.  The food is first rate, and it made for a memorable experience.

In summary, I would recommend the Shore Cliff Lodge and Ventana Grill as a perfect combination for a wedding and reception at one of the most scenic places you will ever see for a wedding.  The rooms are clean, and the location is great.  If you want to stay in the Pismo Beach area as a tourist the Hotel is located a couple miles up Price road from the main town of Pismo Beach, which is not too bad.  If you are visiting the dunes at Pismo, you may be better off finding a hotel closer to the dunes.",Pick a room overlooking the ocean.

This room was perfect, wonderful view, could hear the crashing waves at night. No traffic noise from the sea facing rooms. The room was clean, and quiet. When booking, the website notified us of ongoing construction on the beach trail on the property. Since we were out most of the day, this was not of concern to us. It was mostly a bobcat doing some landscaping work. The hotel is located on a bluff, the closest beach access are some stairs about a 10 minute walk away. The breakfast was decent, kudos to the hard working ladies in the breakfast room, constantly replenishing the food (pancakes, eggs, bacon/sausage, fresh fruit, etc). Would definitely stay again!",,,,,,,,FunInSunPismoBeach,Manager,2016-01-26,"Thank you for leaving such a kind review.

Pros - great views, great breakfast, easy parking, walking distance to downtown Pismo, staff were accommodating and friendly.
Cons - Pet Friendly

Don't get me wrong, we knew ahead of booking that this site was pet friendly, and at the time, I didn't fully understand what this could involve.  He's what I wasn't expecting at the time I made my booking:
a) eating breakfast in the breakfast dinning area and dogs being walked/escorted straight through the dinning area with their owner to the dog off leash area,
b) dogs barking in the units below while enjoying our vacation (something I'm escaping while on vacation, away from home).

Our preference now will be to move away from booking pet friendly motels in the future.","We were top floor (3rd) facing south, great view of ocean (and dog off leash area)",4.0,4.0,,,,3.0,FunInSunPismoBeach,General Manager,2015-12-01,"Thank you for taking the time to review the Best Western Plus Shore Cliff Lodge.

Normally, dogs are not allowed to walk through the breakfast area.  However due to the California Coastal trail project that we have going on, part of the access to the dog area is unavailable to walk to from the outside.  Our dog friendly rooms are located only in a certain area of the property.  I would recommend when staying with us again that you ask for the Ocean Front rooms.

Though we did not drive our electric car, I was impressed that there were two parking spaces for EV charging (one for Tesla). Our room, #127 in the main building, overlooked the gazebo and ocean, as do all rooms in that wing. The sliding shutters are more convenient than curtains and allow guests to vary how much of the outside world to let in.  The room was somewhat on the small size but well appointed.  The bed was a little firm for me and I did not like that the air from the AC flowed directly to the bed (it was unseasonably warm that day so usually this is probably not an issue). There was an upgraded shower head, and though there was but one sink there was adequate space in the bath room.  We very much enjoyed the swings on the lawn and gazing at the ocean from the gazebo.  We drove the short distance to the pier and watched the sun set as the surfers rode wave after wave.  It was a wonderful light show.  In the morning there were beautiful pink clouds looking south over Pismo Beach from the hotel.  I thought the breakfast food was very tasty.  There were warm cheese omelettes, sausages, a scrumptious pot of oatmeal, and sundry fruits and juices. We did not try the pancake maker.

We have enjoyed all of our stays. Recently when stayed here for my birthday. We were given a good rate for a Sunday and Monday. We were able to check in early which is always something we are grateful to receive.

With the discounted rate we received we were put in what I would only guess was the smallest room in the hotel. I understand that is what we had paid for yet it was a disappointment due to the fact that we have stayed in rooms that are 10 times better than the one we stayed in at the same hotel. The flies and smell of bird poop were a little more intense than usual on this stay as well.

I will recommend that you avoid the 1st floor in the building with the breakfast dinning room. It's a little challenging unloading and loading your vehicle when you have to walk through a room where people are having breakfast. 

Like I stated at the beginning of my review, I have stayed here a great deal. It just seems that after the remodel of the hotel the staff is keeping the guests that look for a deal out of the higher end rooms. Staff was indifferent at best during our stay.

The pool area and spa are always clean and well maintained. Pool towels are plentiful and nearby. The breakfast is fine - rather standard hotel fare - but the staff is always there to get more. I like the pancakes though.
I only get an ocean-view room, and I am never disappointed, partially because of the ocean (of course) and partially because of the room. It's large enough in all respects: bed is very big, generally roomy, a nice little desk and a separate reading area, and especially a little balcony.

On December 2014 they changed there name. So when I booked this hotel, I thought I was booking the hotel I stayed in last year, and what a difference. The hotel should be called Best  Western Bird Sanctuary. On the rocks there are thousands of birds and the rocks are loaded with urine and feces. With the wind blowing you get that smell about 3/4 of the day, and it does not smell good. I don't know when the last time they cleaned there roof, but it's has a lot of white bird urine and feces on it. I watched maintenance clean 6 filthy dirty(black) swimming pool filters, bacteria,germs, etc they sprayed soap on them and rinsed them into the storm drain.

KelAZ88,41,"Phoenix, Arizona",2015-06-30,COUPLES,2015-08-15,3,Nice but lots of Pelicans,"This was close to being a 4 star hotel but had some issues.  First was the smell of the pelicans, I know that is not the hotels fault but pelicans smell like old fish and the pelicans are everywhere. I wondered if we were there at the wrong time (early summer) 

Problems:  The door to our balcony was not working well and our room key didn't work the first time.  

The Good:  The staff were however friendly, it was quite clean and the bathrooms were nice.  Everything else was in working order and there was a beautiful balcony looking out over the ocean.  For a short stay it was a clean hotel with a beautiful balcony and view.  Breakfast was included and it was quite nice with some hot items and a large selection.  The hotel is right on a big cliff and has a beautiful view.  I saw the beach was on the other side of the hill but we did not walk there as we were just there overnight.","The main building had no interior hallway, but it also had  balconies looking straight out to the ocean.",4.0,3.0,,4.0,,,FunInSunPismoBeach,General Manager,2015-08-23,"We appreciate you taking the time to provide us with such detailed feedback about your stay.  I am very sorry to hear that there was a challenge with your key and patio balcony door.  Thank you for letting us know about it so that we could provide you with excellent customer service.  I do appreciate your understanding regarding the pelicans, while it is nice to see them in their natural environment, we don't appreciate the odor that they bring!  We’ve tried to dissuade them from spending time at our precise location by making reservations for them elsewhere, however, they like us so much they’re hesitant to check out!  Luckily, they are not here year round.  If you have the opportunity, please come back and see us again, (the pelicans check out during the winter season!) :)

I was not expecting an ocean view room for what I paid for the room but as soon as I opened the curtain, there it was--an amazing ocean view with beautiful grounds.

The views of the beach and the cliffs from the balcony of the suite were inspirational and picturesque. Checking into this hotel was simple, parking was ample, the decor was functional. The suite was a two bedroom and each one had a closet and very spacious. The bathroom was clean, the shower was relaxing. The sounds of the ocean provide a very soothing lullaby at night.  The minor flaws to this property are the plastering of the swimming pool and the noise of the sea birds on the roof-lines of buildings.  The pool needs a new plaster job just to provide a fresh look and cover up some blemishes. Nothing can be done about the wildlife and sharing the landscape should be expected from every guest. I will definitely attempt to stay at this hotel if I have the chance.",,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,FunInSunPismoBeach,General Manager,2015-08-23,"Thank you for taking the time to give us your feedback about your stay at our hotel.

The room was large with two queen beds, a small fridge and a coffee maker with complimentary coffees/teas. The balcony had an amazingly beautiful view of the ocean and the pier. We did not hear noise from the road despite being close to it! The grounds have several sunset swings, which are completely relaxing! Instead of eating at the breakfast buffet (which looked better than expected, with hot food items too), we decided to walk down the beach to Old West Cinnamon Rolls - well worth the short 1 mile walk! This was a perfect place for our family to stop on our way down the coast. On another note, we were very impressed with the housekeeping and maintenance staff. They seemed very friendly and helpful, making sure to greet us as we walked by. I walked down to the overlook in the morning and immediately someone was there to wipe down the chairs from the morning mist - even pointing out the dolphins swimming right in front of the hotel! Very nice stay!

I understand that you have stayed with us in the past and not had the experience that you did this time.  I am very sorry to hear that your stay at the hotel was not up to par.  One of the wonderful things of having a location on the coastline is the vantage point we have to see the natural wildlife that abounds on the coast.  The California coast is a haven for brown pelicans and other previously endangered species of birds.  And while we all enjoy seeing them glide in their typical v-shape formation gracefully above the water, we don’t appreciate the droppings and feathers they – and their other friends – leave behind.  Despite daily cleaning – as much as we are allowed to during our drought – there are times of the year when we just can’t keep up with them.  We’ve tried to dissuade them from spending time at our precise location by making reservations for them elsewhere, however, they like us so much they’re hesitant to check out!  Luckily they are not present here year round, which may be why we did not have these challenges the last time you visited.  They do migrate away from this location in the winter.    If you are traveling through the area during that time, we hope to have the opportunity to impress you in the future.

TravelInSP,25,,2015-08-31,FAMILY,2015-08-07,3,Just so-so,"Wasn't very impressed for what we paid. It is a great location on the cliff where tons of birds hang out. (If you don't like birds- not your place!) The birds probably contribute to the strong odor in parts of the property. Breakfast was a good offering (but food was barely warm), the room was extremely crowded with hardly any seating. Customer service was not amazing- we got into our room and there was a swarm of bees on a plant off the balcony (rm 104). We could not open the balcony door. My daughter is highly allergic to bees. We requested to move rooms and the front desk helped to find another room away from the offending plant but then told us there would be an up charge to move. Health wise we had no choice, but it would have been a nice courtesy to waive the extra cost. They said the room would be ready at a specified time and then called 1 1/2 hrs after that time to say it was ready. ",,,,,,,,,,,,33

The wing that is pet friendly (lower floor only 7 rooms total) has great views and you can hear the waves crashing below all night long.  We were in room 101 which is the farthest south on the property, great for views and privacy, but horrible for WI-FI. (my 4G was faster than the download speeds offered by the Hotel).  The breakfast buffet was plentiful, and changed up during the days that we were there.  Even though it was crowded, the servers working there did a great job of filling the trays and bins quickly.
Wildlife viewing from the hotel was great, we were able to see Humpbacks, Dolphins and countless brown pelicans, Night Herons and of course the obligatory seagulls.  There was even a cute little bunny in front of the room the first night, and a not so cute 3 foot long gopher snake on the stairs the final night.  The hotel even had great interpretive signs giving you information on the wildlife, including their latin names.
We only encountered one problem, and it was our final night, the room above ours had a malfunction with it's AC and it was dripping water on our AC unit all night.  We didn't need the AC but when your trying to enjoy the ocean sounds the dripping was a hassle, so we just put a few towels on our AC unit and went back to enjoying the crashing waves.  Overall very good hotel, and if they can simply fix the internet speeds in the far ends of the place we will give it a higher mark next time we visit.","Room 101 is the best of the dog friendly rooms, great ocean view, waves crashing at night, but beware that WIFI is SLOW!",4.0,4.0,,,4.0,,FunInSunPismoBeach,General Manager,2015-08-05,"Thank you for your detailed review of your recent visit to our property.

Chessa44,16,"Asker, Norway",2015-07-31,FAMILY,2015-07-21,4,Pismo perfection,"We had a great 1 night stay in this fantastic beach hotel.  The pool and hot tub were great for our 5 year old, and you can't beat a pool with a view.  The view from our balcony was fantastic, we were busy spotting whales ( we think) and dolphins, just wished we had brought binoculars.  As other reviewers have mentioned, this is a pelican nesting ground, which was cool to see, but there were other types of birds all around as well, and many nesting on the roof of the hotel, which leads to the general feeling of staying at a bird hotel, not everyone's cup of tea. Nice staff, clean rooms, great views, we will be back.",,,,,,,,FunInSunPismoBeach,General Manager,2015-07-24,"Thank you for staying with us, we are pleased to hear that you enjoyed your stay.

I chose this hotel based on TripAdvisor reviews and was not disappointed. Granted, it was not the cheapest option around and I did also make a reservation at the Hilton Garden Inn and Suites for the same night just in case but ended up canceling that option when we decided to spend the extra money for a night on the coast. It was well worth the money. The views from our room were stunning. The balcony with two comfy chairs was perfect for whale and dolphin watching! Our rooms (we had to book two connecting since there were no suites left) were large, nicely decorated with updated bathrooms.   Upon arrival, we were struck by a noticeable fish smell and soon learned why. The hotel was set on a cliff that was also home to hundreds of pelicans and seagulls! The hotel goes the extra mile to keep the grounds clean but the smell wafts in every now and then. The opportunity to see the pelicans and pelican babies up close was really neat and the occasional smell, which as I said, was not constant, wasn't a deal breaker for us.  We swam in the heated pool which was very nice and used the hot tub. The breakfast was good...standard buffet fare...pancake maker machine (very cool!), cereal, muffins, juice, fruit, yogurt, bacon. The seating area at breakfast was busy so we took our (on trays provided) up to our balcony and ate as we watched dolphins play in the water and pelicans searching for their morning meal.

We appreciate you taking the time to provide us with such detailed feedback of your stay.  I am very sorry to hear that the overall experience was not positive.  We do take the cleanliness of our property very seriously.  While we are fortunate to be sitting right on the edge of the beautiful coastline, it does make us an attractive place for these natural residents to nest.  Luckily, the birds are not present in this area year round nor is the smell constant.  As you can imagine, our feathered friends keep us very busy but we do our best to clear the property of droppings and nests as they become abandoned and hire experts to clean the rooftops.  We are working diligently to keep things as clean as possible while also being conscious about our water use during this time of drought.  

We do appreciate your feedback and hope that you will come back during the winter when the birds are not as present along the coastline.

Everywhere you look they have birds. I am a hobby ornithologist but you better like em up close and personal at this resort. The setting is beautiful, sunsets marvelous but you cant smell the ocean fir the guano wafting up from the cove. Brown Pelicans, Herring Gulls and Cormorants abound on the cliffs just below and overhead and on the balcony, roof, fences, sheds,everywhere. Did i say Guano?  to be fair to the Hotel it is not their fault, but they need to pressure wash the walkways every 2 hrs to remove the admixed fecal waste. The gulls swim and drink from the pool, yes you can try to shoo them away- but you are probably breaking a law doing this. Thank god it doesnt rain here, the red tiles are covered white with excrement and nesting birds. And did i mention feathers.

It is great sleeping with balcony door open catching the cool ocean breezes but if you're a light sleeper, here's where you find the issue; the place is situated near a colony of pelicans and seagulls. The gulls are noisy all night long and if the wind is blowing , you get the aromas of the seagull colony. Maybe it's not like this all year long, but at the end of June it was. They are also nesting on the hotel roof. Overall, though, it's a lovely hotel.

I explained that my mom needs to nap every day, and I wanted her to have a room with a view, so she was able to see the ocean when she awoke.   Barbara was very kind and compassionate.  She gave us a beautiful first floor room (my mom cannot walk much) with an incredible view.  She also left a plant as a gift for my mom with a lovely note in it. My mom has it on her table at home to remind her of our wonderful time at the beach. Barbara was on vacation when we arrived, so Katie Swan, Guest Services Mgr., took care of us.  She was attentive to our every need.  When we reported that the refrigerator didn't work, Maintenance Mgr. Andy Lopez fixed it immediately.  We had toasted our arrival with champagne, but it was ruined since the refrigerator went out.  Incredibly, Tony replaced the bottle the next day!

The rooms were beautiful and very spacious. The bed was excellent. The room had a balcony with an amazing view,  two high chairs and a small table. Perfect for enjoying the sunset with a glass of wine and some small snacks. Everything was really clean, even though the seagulls were building nests, were breeding and were everywhere.
The staff was very friendly and accommodating. In room WiFi was fast and easy to use. No limit on device connection (Smart Phone, Tablet, Laptop, etc.)
The breakfast buffet was nice and provided all the goodies for a strong start of the day.
We dined at the Ventana Grill next door. Perfect location. At first it seems a little over priced but the food turned out to be very well prepared and worth the price. Good wine card!

All in all we really enjoyed our stay. It was very pleasant. This is a clean and comfortable place.

We stayed in room 302 which had a full  ocean view but more of the beach rather than of the cliffs and the sun. We didn't witness any sunrise or sunset. It would have been a nice touch but nevertheless it was easy to walk to the grounds and observe nature at its finest. Being that the hotel is on a cliff, the access to the real beach is tough. Since we had a quick stay, this did not matter to us. 

Our room was very spacious, clean, simply decorated with a king bed. Decent size mini fridge with a microwave. The wifi was pretty weak throughout our stay.  Breakfast was adequate, continental with fruits, yogurt, bread/bagel, boiled eggs. They even had a pancake machine. Since we planned to have a hearty lunch elsewhere, we didn't mind the light breakfast. BTW we were not really swayed by any restaurants in the touristy area (besides Ventana grill), it's better to drive 15mn away to San Luis Obispo where the dining scene is better.

Benjamin R,656,"Rexburg, Idaho",2015-03-31,FRIENDS,2015-03-24,5,"Fabulous view, rooms, staff, and property!","Everyone should stay at this hotel at least once in a lifetime.  The property is so well managed, and the location is so perfect, it just calls out for a visit.  I have booked this property with groups, so I have also been contacted by the group sales folks, who are absolutely wonderful, professionally checking every detail in anticipation of our stay.  The rooms are beautiful, well designed so every room gets a taste of the ocean view.  This can be a very busy place, but it is set up so that you feel the ocean calling out.  The breakfast is in a large room, with a great selection of breads, pastries, fruit, and a pancake machine.  There are sausage and egg sandwiches that can be warmed in the microwave.  Though not exactly gourmet, the food is pleasantly placed, and kept in good order by the attentive staff.  The pool is in a great central location to the various rooms.  It is very clean, and provides a welcome respite at the end of a day.  You can watch the sun set from the hot tub.  You won't see the ocean from there, but the sky is full, and there is usually a gentle breeze.  The property is within walking distance to Pismo Beach, though it is a long walk.  There is plenty of parking at the car park by the pier if you choose to drive into town.  I loved walking down to the end of the pier after dark, and visiting with those who were trying their luck with a fishing pole.  Pismo Beach is a quaint town, very much not a modern place--that is its charm.  If you need to have a walmart fix, there is a shopping outlet just down the freeway, and a Shopping center a couple more miles to the south.  I hope Pismo stays just the way it is.  There are plenty of restaurants.  The BW Shore Cliff Lodge is a fantastic way to enjoy this gem of a place.","The only negative about the rooms is that there are a very few that pick up the noise of traffic more than the ocean.  Avoid the north end of the south building--sound of the freeway bounces off the other building and invades the space a bit; otherwise the rooms are all fantastic.  There are full ocean view rooms--may cost a bit more, but they are probably worth it if that is important to you.  It is a great place to stay.",,5.0,,5.0,,5.0,FunInSunPismoBeach,General Manager,2015-03-29,"Thank you for the five star review!  We are so glad to hear that our property and staff impressed you!

Rachelle M,1,,2015-03-31,FRIENDS,2015-03-16,2,Yikes,"Unfortunately, this hotel made what should have been a joyous occasion, a wedding, very unpleasant.  It started before we even got there, when we tried to change our length of stay from 2 nights to 1 night, per the bride's request, the front desk staff was rude, couldn't use the online system, hung up on us, tried to charge us almost double for the one night stay, and then asked who I was and why I wanted to speak with the manager.   Upon arrival the entire bridal party, including the bride, had to wait 2 1/2 hours for them to get the rooms ready, when we had called in advance for an early check-in.  This caused us to not actually be able to get ready before the rehearsal and rehearsal dinner and we all had to go in our jeans, including the bride, who of course at that point was in tears!  Once we got in the rooms, the water left a filmy residue on our skin, the air conditioning stopped working while we were getting our hair and makeup done and it was 85 degrees outside and when we asked the front desk for coffee creamer, they never brought it to us.  Basically the only good thing about this hotel is the beautiful scenery and the fact that it was at the wedding venue, other than that I wish we would have stayed somewhere else.",,2.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,,,,,2

The bedroom and adapted bathroom were terrific, and I felt really clean after their shower. Breakfast was the usual Best Western fare. A few little minus's and plus's...firstly reception had no idea what an adapted bathroom consisted of or actually meant (shower stools etc)...secondly, I felt quite strongly that the female receptionist was not particularly helpful to us (whilst the man was)....thirdly, the screeching sound of the chairs on the floor in the breakfast room was like pulling finger nails down a blackboard at school...fourthly, I met a wonderful black Labrador who I had a long chit-chat with, much to the owner's dismay (but he didn't know or understand what we were saying) ...and, lastly, but along the same lines, I had a post-breakfast coffee with a Beagle 9-week old puppy called Bailey (he didn't discuss his consumption of Irish coffee with me, though!!).",,3.0,4.0,,,,4.0,,,,,347

Bruce S,73,,2015-02-28,COUPLES,2015-02-09,5,Beautiful Ocean Views and A Wonderful Bed,"We stayed at this location this past week and really enjoyed the beautiful views and the gorgeous sunsets from our balcony. The balcony with two comfortable chairs and a table was the perfect place to relax and watch the sun sink into the horizon. One unusual thing this hotel did was install shutters that slide over the sliding glass doors so you cam allow as much or little light in the room as you wish and atill have a view and privacy too. Kudos!. Nice bathrooms with a good shower/bath with toilet separated from the vanity area so two can get ready at once, a real convenience in the mornings when traveling. The bed was very comfortable, the room spotless, and amenities included a small refrigerator (a bit noisy) a microwave and a large TV with cable and lots of channels for viewing. 

 The staff was friendly, both at the front deak and at the breakfast room where there was a good assortment of breakfast items including fresh ""make them yourself"" pancakes from a machine! Pretty cool. Plenty of seating and a nice atmosphere. We did not try the pool or spa, but both appeared to be clean and well kept. Plenty of parking. Even a self-serve windshield cleaning station which we did use each morning to clean our windshield! 

I highly recommend this location. Great views, great rooms and a cut above most other places on the coast. One caveat is that they do have a strict pet policy. If you travel with a pet (we do not) and take a pet into a NO PET room, you will be charged an additional $250 dollars for violating the strict policy of using pet only rooms, and to have them completely clean the room, treat for fleas, etc.","Would suggest a room away from the pool in the warmer months.

You can see the sunset right from your balcony with an ocean front room.  My husband originally booked an ocean view room (which turned out to have the swimming pool right in front of us).  The hotel staff gladly switched our room to an ocean front for us.  The free breakfast was just okay, the fresh fruit was the best part of it.  The only complaint I have is that the morning we left the hotel, I discovered that my feet (I had worn open sandals) were flea-bitten and red and itchy.  The hotel allows pets (in some rooms), and I had forgotten to ask if we were changed to a pet free room.  I don't know if I was bitten from fleas in the carpet in the room, or from the outdoor area.  I will never stay at another hotel that allows pets.  We usually don't, but my husband looked into all the hotels (that were reasonably priced) for our trip, and said most of the hotels that were right on the beaches allowed pets in some of the rooms.

Unfortunately, we had to book through their corporate number, and were assigned to the worst room on the property (bottom floor, view of the pool house). Not a very nice way to ""reward"" loyal customers. Luckily, the genial young man who checked us in noticed it and gave us a room on the second floor, in an interior hallway. There was a convenient elevator, vending and ice machines right there as well. Although we did not use the fitness room it was one of the best equipped we have seen. 
We had a gorgeous view of the sunset and of the bluffs of Shell Beach. The room was immaculate , spacious, and comfortable. The bathroom had TWO sinks and an adjustable shower head. The tv was large with many channels, and wifi worked well. 
There were some very noisy people staying here, and we could hear every conversation from the hallway, as well as freeway noise from 101. Thankfully, both subsided as the night went on. 
Breakfast had quite a few selections, located in a good-sized room right downstairs. There were microwaveable breakfast sandwiches, a pancake machine, yogurt, hard boiled eggs, cottage cheese, fruit, various breads, etc. coffee was good, too!
We have stayed at several other hotels in Pismo over the years. We love being up on the bluff, but missed a way to access the beach from the hotel grounds. We drove down into town to walk on the sand.

This place may not be a luxury honeymoon hotel BUT it is ideal for the average landlocked family visiting the beautiful chunk of prime coastal property that is California. It's clean and the beds are fresh smelling and the TV has all the channels we get at home! If you view the photo I'm going to post imagine the sounds of waves on the shore and seagulls in the air.

We saw pelicans and dolphins galore. I felt like we were in Hawaii. The wide beach below is accessible by walking through neighboring hotel properties to stairs - and the journey getting there is gorgeous. The large heated pool and jacuzzi are great.

However, it also was very close to the 101 and there was as much noise from the highway as the surf. Some rooms might have less noise, but the whole property suffers from its close location to the highway.  This is true of a number of Pismo beach properties, so if you think this would bother you, look at the map when you book and try to pick a place that is not adjacent to the road.  Also, for the price we paid, some of the little touches were lacking.  On the positive, the staff was friendly.","All the rooms would have some view, so you might like one that is as far away from the highway as possible.",,3.0,3.0,,,4.0,FunInSunPismoBeach,General Manager,2015-01-10,"Thank you for your recent review of your stay with us.

There was a nice view from our porch which was reasonably good sized so that more than two people could sit comfortably on the porch and talk. We felt the air-conditioner didn't heat up the room very fast, and it blew air directly on to the bed. It was not difficult for us because we slept without the heater, and we got a very good night's sleep. There was no neighbor noise. Free wi-fi was good. They provided good-sized yellow writing pad on the desk. The breakfast that was included was very good with both paper plates and china plates for those who preferred them. There was a good selection of hard boiled eggs, yoghurt, pastries, and cereal.  There was always plenty of parking available, even late at night.

We decided to give this hotel a try based on the reviews.  I thought it would be decent based on the $240 (with tax) price for a basic ground floor room.

It was awful.  We had booked the dog room because we had our dog with us.  When we first walked through the door we noticed the bedskirt was stained and discolored so we called the front desk.  When the housekeeping staff came, they accused our dog of peeing on the bedskirt which was entirely not the case.  Just change it and leave, don't make us feel like WE did something wrong.

The walls are paper thin.  We could hear the people next to us watch TV & talk and the people above us kept us nice and awake thumping (aka walking around) through most of the night.

The bathroom was ADA compliant, so it was more like a locker room shower.  The overhead light was dingy and the floor felt unclean.  I took a shower with flip flops and my husband just refused to take one.

If you have a choice -- stay at The Cliffs Hotel.  I so regret dropping $240 in hopes of getting a good night sleep.

We have stayed at the Shore Cliff many times, it had been awhile and we decided to make it trip once again. We check in around 7 pm on Friday evening. The parking lot was completely empty. We had to wait awhile to check in while the front desk employee assisted a guest that did not speak any English. 

The front desk employee checked us in and I asked if there was a chance for an upgrade and I was told that there was not one available. It looked as if the hotel was completely empty and I was surprised at his response. 

With that being said we were booked in the building facing the pool area. It was one of the rooms that have not been upgraded. I have stayed in both the regular and the renovated rooms. There is a big difference it the two rooms and I highly recommend trying to get a renovated room. 

The room was clean and the view was great. An other tip; the rooms facing the pool are considered ""partial ocean view"" these rooms have a full ocean view. The only thing is the pool is in front of the ocean. For some reason we had a great deal of flies in our room. We kept the slider closed the whole time we were in the room but the flies still got in. So that was gross we didn't know how or why the flies made it in the room.

The hotel offers both ice and vending machines. The only downside for some may be the distance to the pier, which is about a mile. However, it's only a short drive away, plus the hotel offers free parking. In addition, there is a small secluded beach to the right side of the hotel down the stairwell.

The location is outstanding, the rooms are very satisfactory, the beds are very comfortable, and, with one exception, staff members were very friendly and helpful. Unfortunately, once we were settled in, we discovered that the internet in our room was unacceptable. When we could connect, it was very slow, and we were dropped after a minute or two when we could connect (true with four different Apple devices). Three different staff members said that that they would notify their internet manager, but nothing changed. A fourth staff member said that they had had complaints about internet in that part of the hotel. They offered to move us to another room late on the second day, which we appreciated. In addition, the toilet seat was broken and the hot and cold faucets were reversed on one sink, a burn hazard. We were charged $45 more than the guaranteed rate on our reservation for the second night, but did not discover it until after we had checked out. Actually, we would stay there again, but we would check the internet before unpacking and we would be careful to review the charges at checkout.",Be sure that usable internet is available before accepting the room.,,4.0,5.0,5.0,,,,,,,8

At first I was sad that we weren't able to stay at the Kon Tiki Inn, but I think that now that I have a one year old, I think the Best Western may have been a better choice.
Though the hotel doesn't have beach access, it does have an enormous heated pool & hot tub.  They even provide swim diapers if you've neglected to pack any.
It was very foggy while we stayed, so our view didn't extend past the pool.
The breakfast isn't fancy, but it did provide choices for each of us (which isn't always the case because my husband follows a Paleo diet).
All of the personnel were wonderful.
The only glitch was a problem with the cable (& wasn't something which could be remedied by the hotel, but rather by the cable company itself-which was unresponsive on a Saturday afternoon of a three day weekend). 
I am so glad we stayed there!

The lawns with Adirondack chairs, the gazebo, the  balconies, all had amazing views. Why pay the exorbitant prices in Santa Barbara when you can go a bit further and have all the views for a reasonable price. Our room, 316, was spacious and clean, bed comfortable, included breakfast simple but tasty, and internet fine. Only real problem was that our balcony overlooked the pool as well as the ocean and 2 families had children who seemed to need to yell and scream from morning til night. There are many other rooms that do not overlook the pool. Another drawback to the location is that you cannot access the beach. For us, this was not a problem.

Room was lovely - well equipped and had everything I could need for a great stay.  Super comfy bed, sofa, desk with convenient power outlets in the lamp, fridge and so on.

I was a little surprised about the ""motel style"" room with outdoor hallways but had I paid better attention on the website when booking I wouldn't have been.  Either way, it wasn't a huge deal, I still felt secure and the only noise I heard was the waves.

Chuck n Suzanne H,354,,2014-11-30,COUPLES,2014-11-13,4,"Very, very nice ocean side hotel.","we spent one night here on our trip to San Fran.  Now, we got in late because our flight was delayed, but still had no trouble checking in.  It's an easy place to find of Hwy 101, even in the dark.  Check in was quick and efficient.  We called ahead and told them we were running later than planned, and it was no problem.  Check in was quick and efficient.  The desk person was friendly and talkative, and was happy to guide us to a good place to eat that night.   Even after dark, a walk around the area was enjoyable and the scenery was breathtaking.  Watching the ocean surf along the cliffs is spectacular during the day.  Seeing this at night, with beach lights and the help of a nearly full moon is beyond description.  

The hotel held the balcony ocean front room we had reserved.  After our walk, we could sit outside and just watch, listen and enjoy the oceanfront.  There was no noise unless we were outside.  The room was very pleasant.  Huge open sliding glass door provides a good view even in inclement weather (not the case during our visit).  Firm mattress with crisp, clean linens and several pillows, decent sitting chairs, flat screen tv, free wifi.  Don't typically use a fridge, so I don't really recall if one was in the room.  Small coffee maker.  Tidy and clean little bathroom and shower with clean and fluffy towels.   Overall, a clean and attractive place to spend a night or two.  

A very good grill house is just around the corner from the hotel.  The Ventana Grill looked like an excellent place to eat and have a drink, but at 8 pm on saturday night, there was an hour or more wait for a table.  We went on to another ""locals"" establishment about a half mile down the road.

Sunrise at Pismo Beach is a thing to behold.  Even on the second of November, dawn brought bright light, no clouds or fog, and a light breeze with 60 degree temps as the sun rose.  Seagulls, pellicans and cormorants nest on the cliffs below the hotel, with wonderous photo ops of the birds waking and starting their day.  The little gazebo on the point is a delightful place to view the early morning.  

They have a small continental breakfast room near the pool.  Gotta be quick and early, and able to compete, otherwise you'll get crowded out.  They have some excellent antique surfboards hanging on the walls of the vaulted room.  Coffee was good.  Otherwise, mediocre breakfast fare at best.

I kind of wish we had more time to spend in Pismo.  Would have, if our plane didn't break the day before.  Anyways....we would stay here again.  Didn't have the least bit of problems in this hotel.

I asked if we could be put on a upper floor and we were told no, so I assumed they were sold out. We were put in a handicapped-pet friendly room on the first floor even though we did not have a pet nor handicapped. I could not sleep the entire night. There was a smell of urine, smoke and sanitizer spray that was unbearable. The shower had mold half way up the grout and the floor had yellow stains in the corners...including in the entry way. I went to the front desk in the morning to have the manager look and ask if they would stay in the room themselves keeping in mind I was going to switch hotels. The house keeping manager came and tried to explain that they clean with bleach after every guest. Really? We were upgraded to a third floor room that was actually clean. They also gave us a discount for the first night. My average rating is because we should have been put in a clean room the first night. Every room should be clean and no one should be put in a filthy room at anytime.  And obviously they were not sold out!

The room is quite nice with good  internet access.  

The grounds are beautiful with a nice swimming pool, spa overlooking the ocean.  There is also a very nice seating area and gazebo.  The views from the property of the Pacific Ocean and of the Pismo Beach pier are very nice.

Breakfast is served in the morning.   They have fresh fruit, cereal, boiled eggs, make your own pancakes, yogurt, cottage cheese, juice, coffee and a wide variety of pastries. In terms of Best Westerns, its an average but good breakfast to get one going in the morning.  They serve till 10 a.m. which makes it nice if one wants to sleep in.

Service here is good and  done with a smile.  Since I was in the building without an elevator, I asked for assistance to get one of my bags to the 2nd floor and they did it quickly and with a smile.  Thanks.  (In general - not an issue but I was tired after a long day driving from San Diego).  I did want to mention in case stairs are an issue for some -there are plenty of wonderful rooms here that will work great, but one might want to specify.)

Parking is free and right by the rooms.

All in all a great stay.   Its one where its debatable if its a four or a five but since I have stayed in some nicer scenic Best Western properties recently, I have rated it very good.  It would make a great stay for anyone - couples wanting some romance to families.

Note:  There are two Best Westerns on the same road very close together.  Both are nice, but do make sure you know which one you booked to save yourself some time when registering.  You might have stopped at the wrong location - its only minutes to the other one.

The location is close enough to be by the ocean and take a short drive (10 miles) to San Luis Obispo for the Thursday night farmer's market, which ia amazing fun.  It was so fun to be staying here on a Thursday night and come back to my very nice ocean view room with balcony.",,,,,,,,FunInSunPismoBeach,General Manager,2014-10-11,"Thank you very much for the amazing review of your visit.

The view of the ocean is unbelievable from every room.  The beds and decor are very nice.  Breakfast is a simple continental but good and fresh.  Only complaint would be that even though it is a non smoking facility... several visits have been ruined by smokers at the jacuzzi or in rooms next to us.  The majority of the staff are friendly and there to please you.  Just recently encountered a less than enthusiastic employee who needs a lesson in remarkable service.,,3.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,FunInSunPismoBeach,General Manager,2014-09-20,"Thank you for your loyal patronage at our property we always love hearing from our guests who have come back time and time again.

Room was very clean and smelled fresh, flowery.  It had a fridge, microwave, coffee brewer, TV, iron, hear dryer.  We also went to the town and we really like it.  It's a great place to stop in.  There was a breakfast in the morning, self service.  The only downside was the WiFi, which was free, but my android phone kept disconnecting, so I just stopped even trying.

pnktypn,48,"Los Angeles, California",2014-08-31,COUPLES,2014-08-31,4,First timer -  Will be our home in future,"Typical Best Western Plus in terms of amenities and comforts.  Maybe larger space overall with a little nice touch of interiors + balcony.  Rather than that, it is Best Western Plus.  Don't expect too much. If complaining of breakfast, you are pathetic. Again, it is Best Western Plus with basic necessities.  Helpful and friendly front desks were also as expected (and of course, very appreciated).  A plus may be welcome cookies which in fact tasted really good.
But this particular facility is not about the room, but proximity to the ocean as most travelers should agree.  Wow, it is just spectacular!  All except pool view rooms on 1st floor must have great ocean views!   We stayed in oceanfront room closer to nearby restaurant on North side.  Must say it was not exactly pleasant to see restaurant building in daytime, but once lightened up around or after dusk, it indeed looked so gorgeous with reflection of the wave.  Morning, afternoon, evening, night.....  You will definitely enjoy changes of pictures and airflow on the same spot!  
The another highlight of the facility was pool + hot tub, of course.  I have never seen such a big ones with right temperature.  The purpose of this particular vacation for us was the escape from crazy daily routines.  Since just wanted to relax ourselves with no particular sight seeing plans, just perfect setting to stay with water most of the days!
Pismo Beach is our routine vacation destination, at least once a year, but ironically it was the first time to stay with this facility.  Definitely will be the one to stay in future!

Yes, the roosting seagulls and brown pelecans were a bit smelly (although the smell wasn't overbearing) but they were great to watch.  We also spotted a few whale spouts and what we think was a couple of dolphins whilst sat on our balcony enjoying the view (and a glass of chilled Californian white!).  The sunset was also pretty special.  The hotel is a little dated but the rooms were clean, the beds comfortable and the staff very pleasant.  The children loved the buffet breakfast - especially the pancake making machine - and the pool is a great asset.  Also good to get free WiFi and parking unlike some of the other hotels on our trip.  We would have liked to stay here longer to explore Pismo itself and the surrounding area but our Highway 1 schedule meant we could only stay the one night.

Upon arrival you are greeted with the unpleasant odor and sight of seagulls, pelicans, etc...thousands of them behind the resort.  Every-time we wanted to sit on our balcony to enjoy our $$ view we were fighting off flies that swarmed our balcony and ended up in the room.  So we only enjoyed the view from inside the room.  We returned to our room one afternoon to find an invasion of ants.  We had to throw out all our groceries and keep all garbage outside the room.  We killed all the ants and requested room service to  return to vacuum up any dead ants or ones we may have missed...never came.  The breakfast was slim pickings as well.

I selected this hotel based on high ratings on Trip Advisor.  We couldn't have been more disappointed.  While the interiors are nice and the view is spectacular, the exteriors are not well maintained.  This is basically a very tired motel with rusting ironwork and badly in need of a paint job.  Bird poop on the walkways and stairs.  There as so many beautiful and well maintained hotels in the area for the same price - I would NOT recommend staying here.  I did walk up to the Best Western Shore Cove Lodge up the street and it was beautiful.  It appeared to be very well maintained and more along the lines of what I would have expected for $350/night.  I would recommend that management invest in upgrades to the exterior of the property as the views are spectacular and with renovations this could be a beautiful place to stay.

The bathroom amenities were also a step above other BW locations, but the breakfast was not as good as some other locations as it was strictly continental, with no hot foods, other than an automated pancake maker. We were assigned a king room overlooking the pool and ocean beyond. The activity and noise from the pool were a little distracting, but ended by 9:00 or 10:00, so don't get one of those unless you want to overlook your children or friends at the pool. The bed was very comfortable, and both bed and bath linens were adequate if not deluxe. Pillows at all the BW's which we've recently visited have been plentiful and all the same - a little dense and too full for my tastes, but could be the next person's perfect choice. This locations offers a 10% discount on food at the adjoining restaurant, just across a parking lot, and the food and drinks there were reasonable and overall, above average.

The room opened directly onto the car park, which resulted in noise. The Staff were not particularly friendly.  The outside area smelt from the hundreds of sea gulls and pelicans (which were good to watch for a while).
Pismo town felt very low end and unattractive, it seemed to be aimed at the RV/camping market. I am sure we did not see Pismo at its best as it was covered in fog, whereas 3 miles either side was hot and sunny!

Breakfast is your standard fare but not even close to the amount of seating for the amount of people staying at this establishment.

My eighteen year old son was ignored for ten minutes by the woman at the front desk while she finished typing emails before she acknowledged his presence. Service to our non-working air-conditioner took so long that we needed to put our  other son to bed and went without air-conditioning for the two night stay.

MadKas,159,"Zurich, Switzerland",2014-07-31,FAMILY,2014-07-02,3,pelicans are nice - BUT the smell...,"We selected the hotel because of the great reviews in average.
Yes - the view is nice
Yes - the rooms are clean (but nothing extraordinary)
Yes - it is interesting to watch the pelicans in front of the hotel
BUT - the smell of the birds is awful - the reason is that the motel has a huge bird nest mountain below it.
We are surprised that most people did not even mention this smell...
We would not have selected the motel if we would have known this...
We did not feel to use the pool after seeing all these birds around...","If you love the birds - great choice
if not - select another hotel",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,FunInSunPismoBeach,General Manager,2014-07-06,"Thank you for taking the time to review your recent stay.

The pelicans are not usually here year round (in fact they have just recently returned) but they are really a sight to see as they glide on the wind along the cliff side that we are situated upon.

She looked at it and said, ""name, please"".   [Each guest's name is clearly and bolded printed on confirmations.]  At minimum, she was less than astute.  I had to tell her to look at the confirmation.  She was less than friendly through the remainder of the check-in experience.

The view and the bed were by far the best amenities in the room. I'm a sucker for a bed that makes me just want to lay there all day. The continental breakfast was good, However it would be nice if they offered trays so those of us wanting a more intimate surrounding at breakfast time can take our goodies to the room. The view spectacular, I didn't get to experience the sauna or pool, it was pretty crowded up until it closed but it was clean and plenty of towels. My only concern was the bathroom , the shower didn't seem to be thoroughly clean enough for me and our toilet didn't completely flush, We manage the night since we were out enjoying the views and weather. At check out Katie did inform me I could have contacted the front desk and it would've been handled. Thanks Katie you were the highlight of my visit as far as people I was in contact with out there, everyone wasn't as inviting and friendly. And great job on the seafood restaurant choices you referred me too. I had a great lunch... Lastly a $50 incidental hold was added to my bill once I checked out and I wasn't informed on the web site for booking of this added hold so I called just to confirm and explain to the girl that answer the phone that this should've been communicated one way or the other. I understand some hotels do this but generally its communicated she proceeded to tell me that I should  have known this since all hotels do this and put me on hold, she didn't ask me to hold at all I was on hold for 15min, can someone say RUDE. I just hung up and decided to right my review and do my research next time. Unfortunately I didn't get her name.",,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,FunInSunPismoBeach,General Manager,2014-06-07,"Thank you very much for your review!  I am thrilled to hear that Katie was particularly helpful to you during your visit.  I am glad to hear that you enjoyed the view and comfortable bed as well.  I did want to let you know we do have trays available for our guests to take their breakfast back to the room, any of our Breakfast Room Associates can provide our guests with a tray.  I am sorry that  we may not have been clear enough regarding the $50 incidental hold.  I will work with the staff to make sure that we communicate that more clearly in the future upon check in.  I do hope that we have the opportunity to exceed your expectations on your next visit!

S Patricia A,33,"Sunnyvale, California",2014-05-31,COUPLES,2014-05-30,4,Just came home and loved our stay here!,"My fiancé and I needed a getaway and both love Pismo, we stopped here and asked to check out a room to get a feel for the place and the view! Wow amazing, we had to stay just based on the spectacular views! Only issue was website said we got fresh baked cookies upon on arrival and asked the three days and never had any available. 
Also on our last day out enjoying the gorgeous pool there was a group of about 6 people who jumped the fence and used the pool for about an hour while we were there. They weren't rowdy or too loud but took all the towels. A hotel staff member saw them and quickly turned towards the office, I'm guessing to let front desk know but no one ever did.

They have cribs at the hotel and they'll bring you one upon request along with special kids bedding.  The breakfast was nice, and the coffee was surprisingly tasty.

One thing of note, if you book at best western.com, they misrepresent their ocean view rooms.  Unless you very carefully read the fine print, you'll see that there's a partial ocean view (which is more like you have to twist your head to see the ocean view), and the full ocean view.  Make sure you get a full ocean view, it is so incredibly worth it.  The ladies at the front desk were aware of this hiccup on the best western site, so they let me upgrade at a very discounted rate.

Our room had recently been refurbished and was of an excellent standard. Overlooking the beach and out towards the pier it was spectacular to say the least. Comfortable, clean cannot fault the room.

Problem is that the hotel seems to be currently being refurbished AROUND the room!! Starting at 8 in the morning workmen wandering around banging, singling and generally doing noisy things sharp petered the peace of this previously wonderful place. We'd hoped on 2 days catching up on jet lag with afternoon naps.......no chance!   We'd have perhaps expected an email in advance warning of these issue.

Security is an issue for us too here. No external doors are locked and anyone can walk in.

Even though I had requested an upper level room I was given a ground floor room. The reddish-haired lady who checked me in had a scowl on her face the entire time. She kept running to the back room and talking on the phone about their computer system being down. She could have at least faked a smile or told the other lady to help me first instead of letting me stand there waiting and having new customers be served before me. She needs more training regarding being under pressure and how to handle public service.

The walls were very thin. The people upstairs were walking around and I could hear every thump. The view from the room was nice though. There were spiders in the corners of the room which scared me. I have never stayed in any hotel before that had spiders. 

The ventilation system was very old and noisy. The pool was huge but the wind was so fierce nobody could even stand outside that day.

He was staying in the room the other side of me and had gone for a late night swim in the pool and gotten the wrong room. So in another words a terrible nights sleep for me.

ann572,53,"Las Vegas, Nevada",2014-04-30,FAMILY,2014-04-18,5,Five star resort view without the $$$,"Just returned from spending three days at this hotel on Spring Break with my two elementary school aged boys (8 and 6).  From the get go, this hotel exceeded my expectations.  Check-in was smooth and fast.  Katie at the front desk was very nice and helpful. 

I have traveled the world and have stayed in many five star resorts.  We received a room on the third floor and the ocean view overlooking the pool was completed unobstructed.  What a feeling to open the hotel room door for the first time to see the sun shining on the sparkling blue ocean waters!  I can say that the view here was better than many of the oceanfront rooms I have paid $400+ for in the past.  Seriously. 

Despite the old fashioned motel/ motor inn architecture with open air hallways,  
the rooms are very spacious and appear to have been updated quite recently.  Everything looked new and in great condition.  The decor, furnishings, carpeting, large LG flatscreen, modern bathroom fixtures were all very tasteful-- giving a boutique hotel room feeling.  I definitely did not feel like I was in a standard cookie cutter Best Western.  The rooms are appointed with fridge and microwave which came in handy with young children.    

The included breakfast is served from 7-10am.   There was plenty to choose from: hard boiled eggs, pastries, toast, bagels, an automated pancake making machine, microwaveable hot pockets and breakfast sandwiches, cereal, yogurt, fruit, coffee and tea.  We only ran into a long line on one day and it seems the delay occurs because of the wait for microwaves and pancake maker.  Of course you always have the option of taking your food to your room, which I saw people doing.  Menu is the same everyday.  Again, not to belabor the point, but this was a huge benefit with the kids.  Not having to search for breakfast options each morning helped save time and money on the trip.  

I would highly recommend this hotel for romantic getaway, family trip and as a base for trips up and down the Central Coast.  The hotel is close to SLO, Santa Maria airport and surrounding beach cities.   I took the kids to Avila Beach, Guadalupe Dunes, Oso Flaco Lake and SLO Farmer's Market held every Thursday nights in downtown.  There is a charming park called Dinosaur Caves Park up the road in Shell Beach that has magnificent views and playground.",,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,FunInSunPismoBeach,General Manager,2014-04-20,"Dear An,

LoneOak6496,166,,2014-04-30,BUSINESS,2014-04-08,4,stumbled on this by accident - glad i did,"I needed a place to stay for one night on my trip south. I pulled in and they gave me a lovely room  with a beautiful view on the sunset. I could lay in bed and hear the ocean. It is spring break so there were kids making lots of noise by the pool but it didn't go too late. I could see the lighthouse shining in the distance.

The room was nice with micro and refer, but what surprised me was that the bathroom had 2 sinks! Great for a couple.

Breakfast was adequate and a reasonable selection of food - 

Seagull flew and perched on my balcony and wasn't afraid... not particularly aggressive either. Do not feed them - where there is one there are lots more.

i grabbed a salad and a bottle of wine from Trader Joes and enjoyed the rest of the evening watching the sun set...

Tor T,1,"San Francisco, California",2014-03-31,COUPLES,2014-03-30,1,Obscenely rude front desk guy; bogus ocean view,"Shockingly rude and abusive treatment by a graveyard shift front desk manager named Andrew. We were promised an ocean view; instead got just the ugly sight of a pool and other hotel rooms (arrived late at night; turns out there's a tiny glimpse of the ocean if you crane your head far enough). When I returned and said politely we were unhappy with the room, Andrew, who had been extremely unfriendly from the start and had kept with condescending voice calling my wife ""dear"", inexplicably, without provocation, raised his voice, and said in a bizarre, word-by-word aggressive delivery: ""It. Is. An. Ocean. View."" When I respectfully disagreed with him, he kept repeating that, and added: ""That's what you paid for. That's what you get."" I said, calmly, ""We only see other rooms from the window."" He kept his voice raised, assumed a belligerent wide-armed stance, and said: ""I will not argue semantics with you!"" I asked if there were other rooms; staring me down with beady eyes, he said there were none. When I pointed out that the vacancy sign was lit, he said: ""Oh, oh, so now you're calling me a liar?"" I was dumbfounded and shocked, already exhausted from having driven for hours late at night. I said, ""You're very rude."" He then said: ""If you say another word, I will evict you."" Yes, he said that. He then said, ""You're not even a registered guest."" (My wife and I both checked in together, but he somehow deemed me illegitimate because my wife had registered the room in her name.) After hearing of this exchange, my wife called the front desk from the abysmal room we had been placed in, to see about getting a refund and finding another hotel, but Andrew immediately sneeringly called her ""dear"" again. She said, ""Can you please not call me 'dear'?"" He blew up at her, and said: ""You can leave."" We were dumbfounded. We tried to find another hotel room, but it was too late and other available options were few and beyond our budget. We were exhausted and in shock, so we just stayed the night. The next morning, an unresponsive national customer service agent told us to talk to the day manager, who wouldn't be able to speak to us for another hour. I waited, and met the manager (Barbara) at the front desk, and explained our experience. She was oddly blank on hearing of our treatment. Rather than express shock or sincere apologies, she was skeptical, and said that she knew the night manager well, and would need to get his side of the story. She did offer a measly compensation, but her response smacked of indifference. Overall: the false advertising ""ocean view"" room was bad enough; the abusive treatment from the manager was shocking, almost unbelievable. We didn't feel safe staying there after that. The lack of an adequate response to our complaint from the day manager added insult to injury. Needless to say, we will never set foot in this hotel again, let alone any Best Western.",,,,,,,,FunInSunPismoBeach,General Manager,2014-04-03,"Dear Guest, 
Thank you for providing feedback regarding your stay. First, I apologize that you felt our staff was not hospitable.  As you may have seen on other reviews online, we consistently exceed service expectations so it is disappointing when a guest is dissatisfied.  I can assure you that when we do have issues that arise we do make the effort to address it with our staff.  We use it as a learning opportunity and make changes as appropriate. I apologize if you or your wife felt disrespected, that certainly was not the intent.  The following morning when I met with you, I felt you were satisfied with the room once the view was apparent in the daylight.  I was pleased  when you decided to remain in that room for the second night of your stay.  I did want to address a specific concern that you expressed with regard to our representation of the view types.  All our rooms do have an ocean view, however, both in the descriptions and photos posted on our website, it explains the type/level of view.  Our website offers many photos of our rooms with the applicable description and the applicable rate.  Additionally, all of our reservation staff are happy to assist with answering any questions or providing any extra descriptions.  As always, we take any feedback as an opportunity to learn and make improvements both in customer service and how we promote our hotel.  Thank you again for your comments and we look forward to providing a better experience in the future.

The bed was comfortable, the shower was ok, the bathroom was of a good size and even though there was no kettle facilities in the room, they was a coffee machine and a microwave which did the job of warming water.

Plenty of parking and even great for doing laundry. They have a DIY laundry room with a washer and dryer. Washing powder is avaiable from the reception desk (at a $1 per pack- though the pack is only half filled so best to bring your own).

No non smoking kings available and yet our reservation showed we reserved one.

Namathy,5,"Long Beach, California",2014-01-31,FAMILY,2014-01-10,5,Best. Best Western. Ever.,"1. The view is absolutely AMAZING, and you have a private balcony, too. Ask for room 225 or 125. Consider oceanfront over ocean-view. It just changes the whole atmosphere of the place. Coming here and getting a non-oceanfront room is like going to Sweden then dating a brunette.

2. Breakfast is quite nice, with actual flatware and plates (versus disposable paper and plastic utensils at HIE) has a dedicated room with lots of tables and plenty of good food choices. There's a very busy woman always keeping it clean and making sure everything is stocked and the buffet tables are clean and picture perfect. Nothing like enjoying warm tea and milk on the balcony in the cold.

3. The pool is huge and has a great view, and there's a glass enclosure so the wind won't freeze you to death and you still get a great view.

4. The rooms themselves. Those shutters cost like... 4,000 and add to the seaside feel. The beds are very comfortable. On this roadtrip, we stayed at a bunch of different hotels and I can say without a doubt, these beds were top notch!

Downsides:

1. Heater is on the weak side. They have blankets, though. Two blankets for double rooms, unlike some other hotel chains (cough HIE).

2. Breakfast's only protein source (besides milk and yogurt) was very cold hard-boiled eggs. Not a major downside, but HIE has sausage patties and hot eggs (to eat on paper plates, mind you). I usually eat a light breakfast so I don't care. If you're worried about getting hungry in an hour, just eat more delicious butter. It's real butter! Oh yeah, and the ""Lucky Charms"" cereal is seriously lacking in marshmallows. It's like 2% marshmallow!

Nitpicking here but I try to have balanced reviews that are helpful. =)","Oceanfront. 225 or 125. 2nd floors have more privacy when people are walking around the beach paths.

packyourheart,159,"Bakersfield, California",2013-10-31,COUPLES,2014-01-07,3,Second time not so charming.,"My husband and I stayed on this property for a second time in October 2013 and were completely disappointed this time.  I originally booked the room about three months in advance for the weekend of the 11-13, but our babysitter fell through and I had to reschedule for the weekend of the 18-20 which is the weekend of the Pismo Clam Festival so I knew rooms would probably be scarce and extremely expensive.  I called the hotel direct and explained the situation and asked if I could get a room for the next weekend at the same price considering I'd booked the room so far in advance, and was told that there were absolutely no rooms left for that weekend.  Disheartened, I took her word for it and began searching other properties and even other beach cities, but we love Pismo and I wasn't willing to give up our romantic getaway to the central coast.  I ended up calling Best Western's reservation line and was told there were rooms left at the Shore Cliff and the man wasn't sure why the front desk clerk had told me there wasn't.  The rooms were ""pet-friendly,"" which I was fine with as I was sure they did regular deep cleanings on those rooms considering how clean the entire property was upon our first visit in March 2013.  I went ahead and booked the pet-friendly room and was given a pretty deep discount for the trouble I'd gone through, which I greatly appreciated.  When we arrived to the property to check in I asked if any no-pet rooms had become available, and one had, so we she let me have it.  She did not tell us that it was half the size of the other rooms.  That room was so tiny compared to the room we'd had on the first stay, the bed didn't seem as comfortable, the air conditioner was really, REALLY loud and clunky, and it was on the first floor overlooking the pool which was OK, but if you're on your patio while people are enjoying the pool area, everyone can hear your conversation and see what you're doing, which was slightly disturbing.  Also, the first time we stayed we didn't know we couldn't smoke ANYWHERE on the property (except in the parking lots and in the far South corner of the property) until I read reviews of people complaining that other's were smoking on their patios (probably us) and management responded with some comment about how no one is supposed to be smoking anywhere on the property.  Being smokers, this is annoying to us because any time we want to smoke we have to trek way out for a cigarette, but you can bring your big stinky dog and it can crap wherever it pleases, and I have to listen to it bark all night long.(By the way, the only area on property where one can smoke is located in the corner of the area where pets go to do their business.)  The grounds of this hotel are still absolutely beautiful and the smokers area is actually pretty nice with some patio furniture overlooking the ocean with a nice view of the pier.  My real issue with this property is that there is absolutely nothing extra considering how much the rooms are.  We noticed that the Sea Crest, which is two hotels down, had two beautiful fire pits and much nicer outdoor areas than our hotel, and we were jealous.  Also, the Shore Cliff doesn't have beach access, which we knew from our first stay and is OK.  It's just a short walk to a residential street which does have beach access.  You'd think for almost $200 (or over $200/night depending on when you book) they would have SOMETHING for younger people to do there.  They have a gorgeous gazebo out on a peninsula-like cliff that overlooks the ocean and is the perfect place to watch the sun setting, but it is completely under-utilized.  There is no furniture on it, there used to be benches built onto the railing but those were removed sometime between March and October.  If I was the marketing director of that hotel I would not be relying solely on the ocean and weddings to garner customers.  I would be using that gazebo to its absolute fullest potential.  Can we get a portable bar? Wine-tasting? Something? All in all the property is OK, I just realized that maybe it's more of a property for an older crowd, so the probability of us booking a room here again is pretty small.  Next time we'll probably try out something geared toward a younger, more vibrant crowd.  My husband and I only get two weekend a year to get away without children and we like to live it up.  The Shore Cliff definitely isn't that place.   If you're looking to just relax in a beautiful and extremely quiet environment (and you don't smoke) this property is probably better suited for you.",Get a room on the second or third floors in the building which the balconies face west.,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,,,,,27

jamiestravels,9,,2013-11-30,FAMILY,2013-11-29,5,Wonderful View,"We arrived very late at night around 1 am, on our way from AZ to San Francisco for Thanksgiving.  Andrew the night clerk was right there and let us into the lobby.  I asked for a ""quiet"" room on the ocean.  He found us a top floor with a gorgeous view of the ocean and pier.  We slept to the sounds of the surf and awoke to the wonderful view.  Andrew offered to help us with our luggage and told us about their complimentary breakfast, which we slept through. 

The room was clean and spacious. The bed comfortable.  And fitted sheets!  I won't stay at hotels that don't use fitted sheets.  And the view spectacular.

While our check in was excellent, our check out was a little less so.  We had planned to return to Pismo on our way back, but the day clerk said they wouldn't guaranty a room, even if I spoke to the manager.  I'm not above ""bribing"" hotel staff for the best rooms and service.  I do well financially and I expect and will pay for the best.  My suggestion that if the hotel wanted repeat business they might want to consider accommodating good clients fell on deaf ears.  Apparently they make enough money they don't need the repeat business.  So we are continuing our trip via Lake Tahoe.

I rate the hotel excellent for Andrews quality service and for the location.  But customer service by the daytime staff could use improvement.  Overall the hotel is a fabulous place to stay.  One of the best views on the CA coast, if not the world.  Enjoy a wonderful location, just don't expect some of the staff or management to go out of their way for you.","You really have your choice of views.

We had a 2nd floor King Ocean View room with balcony, and we loved the view. So far the best view of anywhere we have stayed although all our rooms had ocean views. The room was average size - we paid a fair price - although the billing was all messed up when we checked out. We were charged their rack weekend rate for the entire length of our stay, about $700 more overall than our original confirmation. - It took a while for the manager to fix it, but she was very gracious. The continental breakfast is comparable with other places we have stayed in the area, nothing special, but adequate. The bed was comfortable, the rooms are not soundproofed at all so don't plan on sleeping in (but we expect that at that price point), and everyone on the staff we interacted with especially the housekeepers were extremely nice and very helpful. They have a large pool compared to other hotels and it is kept nice and warm.

As it was a holiday we paid a premium price for a partial ocean view room.  The room was great with a view over the pool and the ocean.  As others have said the hotel benefits from an outdoor pool, hot tub and a fitness room. It also has free parking and is convenient for local attractions.  The only downside we found was the breakfast room is very small for the number of people wanting to use it.  We took ours up to our room and ate it on the balcony which was fine.  One other thoughtful thing the hotel provides is chairs on your balcony which are higher than normal to let you see over the barrier to give an uninterrupted view.

The hotel sits on the cliff overlooking the ocean and all rooms have ocean views. The room was large w a king size bed, the bath has a double sink, granite counter, and ceramic floor.  The bath and room looked very clean but there was a slight pee odor in the room. I'm guessing this may have been due to a previous occupants pet as the hotel is pet friendly. There were no vacancies so we couldn't move to another room so rather than pack everything and scramble to find another hotel we bought Febreze and an a air freshener, which worked well enough.  Aside from this minor issue they have a large court yard w tables overlooking the cliff, beach and pier which was beautiful. We spent an a few hours one afternoon just hanging out there watching the birds, the waves, beach walkers and surfers as we drank Mimosas. 

In addition, the hotel offers a very nice continental breakfast, nicer than most similar style hotels.   There was also a fair amount of available parking and it seemed to be well lit and safe.

The views are gorgeous and the outdoor pool is heated so you're able to enjoy it in 60 degree whether! :-)
Rooms were clean & bed was comfortable. Got upgraded to a balcony room on 3rd floor because the hotel was so empty being offseason.
Only downsides: The included breakfast could use a boost. They lack hot items and freshly made pancakes. For a 3 star hotel, having a buffet style breakfast offering such items would suffice rather than not offering them at all. You could make your own instant pancakes but it's not quite the same. 
Also- pillows are incredibly uncomfortable. Upgraded a pillow and you can improve your sleep quality twice fold! I found the pillows were quite uncomfortable and woke up with a stiff neck. The mattress was just fine, though, so it's a toss up. If you have upper back/neck issues, or need a high-quality pillow for sleeping, being your own.",,,,,,,,FunInSunPismoBeach,General Manager,2013-11-10,"Dear Guest,

HappyTraveler0109,489,"Pasadena, California",2013-10-31,FAMILY,2013-10-20,3,Noisy Wall Air Conditioner!,"First, let me say that this motel has a fantastic location. The beautiful, blue Pacific is just down the cliff and you get spectacular views from your balcony with an oceanview or even partial oceanview room. Second, it is located right next door to Ventana Grill Restaurant & Bar where we went for a wedding reception. The food, drink and atmosphere was wonderful. Again, the views from the balcony were quintessential California coast!

My biggest knock on this property is the noisy in-wall A/C/Heating units instead of central air/heating.  These units are loud and it's impossible to sleep with it on.  Okay, so what you say . . .if it's hot, just sleep with the window or balcony door open and let the night air cool the room.  Point well taken, if you're on the upper floor like we were, but, what about the security risk if you're on the first floor? And, what do you do when the weather turns cold and you need this noisy heater to keep the room warm at night?? If you spend most of your time outside enjoying the sights on your vacation and only need a good, safe, clean, QUIET room to get a good night's rest on your journey, how can you do that with a noisy wall air conditioner??  And, I agree, the flies were a bother and agree with the JulieandDan comments on this site.  They really could use a good exterminator on-site.

I don't wish to knock this property too much. It was a good value for the money with continental breakfast (including a make your own pancakes machine), attentive staff and up-dated rooms -- just go when you know you won't need to turn on the A/C/Heater and you'll be assured of a good night's sleep!",Oceanview rooms are worth the price difference.

JulieandDan,128,"Columbus, Ohio",2013-10-31,COUPLES,2013-10-19,3,OK for a quick stop,"We stayed at this hotel for one night. It was our first stop on our drive up the Pacific Coast Highway. When we arrived and got out of our car, I noticed a ton on flies near the front door. I didn't give it too much thought until we walked in the lobby, and a big swarm of flies was in there too. It was pretty gross, and not a good first impression. We stayed at several other hotels near the beach during this trip, and didn't run into this fly issue again. Every time we opened our door to our room, it was a mad dash so we didn't let the flies in. Also, when we checked in, I asked about the restaurant next door and if it was walking distance. The young man behind the desk was a little snarky and responded with a exasperated little laugh ""it's like 20 feet away..."" Like I should've known--even though we just pulled in, coming from the other direction. Again, not a great first impression. The woman behind the desk was more helpful and kind of made a face like she knew he was being less than gracious.
The room itself was average. I did find a few hairs in the bathroom that weren't ours....but other than that the room seemed OK. The saving grace of the stay was the view. It's beautiful. We were ocean front on the second floor. And there didn't seem to be any flies on the balcony side so that was a relief. We went for a run in the morning on the beach and that was great too--very pretty rocky coast worth checking out. We also really loved the Ventana restaurant which is walking distance (duh!), right next to the hotel. That meal and the great view saved this stop. It was fine for the one night we were there, but I'm glad we left the next morning.

Our room had been updated (yes it was clean) They left the old shower with white tile and shower curtain, but other than that is was quite nice.  The breakfast was nothing to write home about, but I only need coffee so no gourmet fare is a deal breaker for me.

We arrived just after the sun had goine down, but there were still beautiful colors in the sky.  Our room had a gorgeous view of the ocean, so did the pool and hot tub area.  There is a little walk along the cliff edge, as well.  My husband complained that the place did smell like sea birds, who seemed to think they owned the place, but they never bothered me.  Our room was very comfortable, well decorated, extremely clean, with a little patio facing the sea.  It was expensive, but it felt like a good choice.  You do have to walk to the road and down another path, past other hotels to actually get to Pismo Beach, but it is not very far, maybe 10 minutes, and a pleasant walk.  We didn't have anyone walking past our room, only a few other guests, so our room felt rather private, though we could ""hear"" our neighbors.  We did have the pool and hot tub to ourselves for awhile and the pool is very large with a great ocean view, protected from the wind by a glass wall.

It sounded like we'd gone to bed in a school canteen. Then there was some kind of maintenance work going on to add to the mix. Constant banging on paper thin walls.

Jack A,1,,2013-09-30,COUPLES,2013-09-09,4,Great place to stay for central cost standards,"Typically the coast hotels are never as clean an updated as hotels in different parts of the state.

Pros: 
-AMAZING view from the rooms (we asked for pierside, though it does not face the sunset FYI, but still an amazing view).  The crashing waves are loud and helped us sleep like babies.
-Beautiful property. There is a little veranda that overlooks the tidepools and cliffs.  We walked over there for sunset and took some great pictures.  As soon as you walk into the front office, you are surrounded by huge windows overlooking the ocean.
-Nice staff
-great location: not in the busy city center but only a 15 minute walk (which you can do on the beach if you want).  There's also a restaurant next door that I heard is pretty good.

Cons: (nothing really bad, but there are a few things where I would have given 5 stars)
-No room service (but there was a restaurant service you could call that delivers).  
-The beach access is two hotels down, which wasn't a huge deal
-The breakfast included was not very appetizing (sugary rolls and pancakes, but hey it's ""free"")

Dan M,72,"Fresno, California",2013-09-30,COUPLES,2013-09-02,5,Great Views and Wonderful Room,"My wife and I stayed here over Labor Day Weekend 2013.  Check in was a breeze and we had zero issues or concerns with our room during our stay.  Our room was more than comfortable and there was plenty of space.  Our room had a balcony which directly overlooked the ocean and the view was incredible.  The Pismo Pier and many of the mom and pop type places to eat were less than a 1 mile walk away.  On a busy weekend, it was actually quicker to walk from the hotel to the pier than try to fight traffic and then find a parking spot.  Although the hotel had no direct beach access, there were plenty of public beach access points very near by.  I also found time to make use of the Hotel's swimming pool which I found very refreshing and unusually larger than most Best Western Hotels.  The only negative aspect of our stay was the less than average breakfast.  Having paid about 3x as much as I would for most BW stays, I had expected there to be a better spread at breakfast.  It was actually less than most BW hotels at which I have stayed.  This really was not a huge issue, because if you are staying in Pismo and relying on the hotel breakfast, you are missing out on some great opportunities to eat at some great local eateries.  Based on my experiences this past weekend, this may become a regular vacation for my family with this Best Western being the place we stay.",We had a room on the second floor.

The view, in combination with the outside grounds (nice lawn, good pool) are the strong points of the hotel.

Rooms are spacious and clean and almost all have ocean view, at least partially. However, if you look at the details you can see that furnishings are just a little bit better than in your standard motel and are also somewhat worn down.

The complimentary breakfast had a reasonably large selection and Wifi worked well.

The hotel is in a superb location overlooking the ocean.  Check-in was friendly and efficient.  Our room was spacious and had a view over the pool, the gardens and the ocean beyond.  Clearly the staff have pride in their work - everywhere in the hotel was immaculately clean and well-presented.  The gardens were beautiful and very well maintained.  From the gardens there was a great view over the cliff with the opportunity to spot lots of birdlife including seagulls and pelicans.

Included in the price was a self-service breakfast.  There was a very generous array of goodies on offer.

We ate dinner at the restaurant next door to the hotel - which was excellent.

The very helpful staff on reception made a booking for our next night's accommodation and also printed a detailed set of directions for us.

We all slept with the balcony doors open to the sound of the seagulls and crashing waves, which was a perfect ending to our 4 state extended vacation.

Stellar staff and beautiful grounds completed the experience and was a nice change of pace to our disappointing LA experience. Rooms were clean with updated furniture and well appointed kitchen, however, the bathroom in our unit and the hallways in our building were a bit dated and could use a refresh.

The continental breakfast was the usual fare with juice, cereal, yogurt, fruit, coffee, tea, and a pancake machine.  No complaints with any of that.

My only complaint is how noisy this hotel is.  While in our room, we heard the kids next door screaming and crying for long periods of time, until we finally called the front desk and they sent someone up to tell them to keep their kids quiet.  That helped for a little while.  We were on the 2nd floor and we could hear the people in the room above us every time they walked from one room to another.  Loud thumping.  I cannot recall ever being in a hotel and being able to hear everyone in the rooms around me.  Bring your ear plugs for sleeping and you'll be happy in spite of the noise.

KiwisLA,199,"Lahaina, Hawaii",2013-06-30,FAMILY,2013-06-16,4,Better than we expected - especially for a pet friendly room,"Booked via phone and got an OK rate, a tad expensive, but Pismo Beach was full that weekend for a car show so took what we could get.  Plus we needed a pet friendly room so our small dog could join in the fun, along with 2 queen beds as we had 3 adults in our group.  There was a $25 charge per day for the dog extra which seemed reasonable compared to other pet friendly hotels.
When we arrived the room wasn't ready, but they promised it would be by 4pm.  We left for a late lunch and they rang at 3.59pm to tell us the room was available.  Reception was quite busy but they were maximum capacity. We had a parking space and a parking sticker for the car.
The room was soooo much better than we expected.  The 70's style blue shabby motel exterior of the hotel belies the updated rooms and cliff top sea views you are met with when you enter the room.  Ours was on the ground floor, 105, a few rooms away from the breakfast room.  A huge room with 2 queen beds with luxury linens and plenty of pillows, big screen TV, small fridge, microwave and coffee maker, table and chairs, with a nice large bathroom (shower only) and good toiletries, hairdryer, and finally a little patio with chairs which was perfect to sit and soak in the view of the sea.  Our room overlooked the little grassed area which was pet friendly, and there was a patch of grass with rocks and flowers outside the front door too so it was very easy to toilet our pup.  The hotel also provided a soft blanket, a dog bowl and tasty treats for our pooch too!  Nice touch :)  We were super impressed with the cleanliness of the room - pet rooms can often be covered in hair and smell, but this was spotless and smelt fresh the entire time.  
Breakfast was DIY cereal, pastries/toast, sausage and egg muffins, boiled eggs, yoghurt, and an entertaining pancake machine, with plenty of juices/coffee/tea to choose from.  There are tables to eat at, or like most guests, you can take trays back to your room.  The microwave in the room makes it easy to heat the sausage and egg muffins if you have a late riser who might miss breakfast.  It was a little odd having to walk our pooch through the breakfast room to access the grassed area for dogs, we got a few outraged looks, but it was the only way to get there.
There is a pool/spa but it was crawling with kids so we gave it a miss.
Just down the road, within walking distance, is a nice park where you can walk your pooch for a real walk.  Great views from the cliff tops too.  We walked into Pismo within 5 mins so it is close to restaurants and cafes, in both directions.

But unlike some hotels, this one adds to the location, by providing and maintaining a high standard of accomodation. If you book a two bedroom suite at the end of the hotel away from the lobby, like we did, it's like having a private appartment at the edge of the ocean. You wake up and look down, literally, at waves crashing into the shore.
Minor point: the airco in the living room let through voices from the pool... (fortunately it wasn't busy).

I would like to comment upon this most fantastic, spacious, luxurious room that we had. Reading from the other reviews, this seems to be the general feature of the hotel and not just an exception. Such a spacious, well appointed room we did not expect and that was indubitably the biggest surprise when entered the room. And the bathroom, 2 sinks, lots and lots of place for the toiletries and my wife's make up stuff, huge mirrors. In the room there is a small corner with a sink, a fridge and a micro, a coffee machine and even a small cupboard to keep stuff. Shame that we didn't use it much. Most of all proper glasses and cups and not just paper cups which most of the American hotels provide these days.  

Inspite of all the plus points and inspite of us being absolutely happy and satisfied with most things, we have to mention 2 negative points; 
Firstly and predominantly the hotel should do something about the numerous birds/seagulls all over the place and naturally their droppings everywhere. This certainly mars the overall impression at the end of the day. I don't really fancy bird droppings in the pool and even a few of them taking a swim with me. This did apprehend me so much that I didn't go into the water after this incident for fear of catching some infection.
The second issue is not really a fault of the hotel but seems to be a general practice in America these days. This was the third weekend we spent in a hotel while in the USA and everywhere we encountered this phenomena. Many a folks just go to a hotel over the weekend to party and do not take any consideration of the next door neighbors. Towards the afternoon on Friday we had noticed some young people emptying their cars filled with beer in huge coolers, so it was with trepidation that we faced the outcome as the night approached. And we were not disappointed, as the night advanced the louder they became. No doubt after a complaint with the night staff at the desk, the security tried to put an end to it, but the folks just went to the other side of the hotel and continued with their loud partying. So another call with the night staff and eventually they stopped, but it takes time and I ask must it be. Why can't one go to a pub and party there. In my opinion the hotel should specifically inform such guests while check-in, that this will not be tolerated.

All in all, a hotel we would certainly recommend. In Pismo beach there is nothing much to do or see, specially when one has been to Monterey and Carmen before.",If you like room with a view then you should take one with a full view and not just a partial view.,3.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,FunInSunPismoBeach,General Manager,2013-06-08,"Thank you for your comments. Your feedback is very important to us. I am glad that you enjoyed our newly remodeled rooms. The suites are the most spacious rooms we have in the hotel and definitely most family friendly. 

The birds are definitely a problem that we all face at the coast. It is an up hill battle trying to stay one step ahead of them. I have added additional staff members so that we can provide the clean environment and accommodations our guest deserve.

I am sorry that you experienced noise complaints from surrounding rooms. We do have a “NO” Party policy and a penalty fee if it is broken. We do our best to enforce it but sometimes guest will do what they want no matter what.  I am sorry that you had to experience this during your stay.

We paid $179 + Tax. It is a little too pricy but for the location and view it was worth it. We really enjoyed our stay. Only bad thing was the heater was noisy and woke us up in the night. Once we shut off the heater we were able to sleep. Hotel staff was nice and helpful. Lobby is over looking the nice well maintained garden and ocean.

We only stayed one night, wish they had a room available for another night. I will definitely like to come back and stay in this hotel for 2 days.

Nice reception area. Fairly good customer service. Requested for a room on the second floor but they were not able to accomodate my request even though I was checking in quite early. Room was nice and clean. Heater AC combo did not work that well. Turned on heater but after a few minutes it was only fan and no heat.

Had a good night sleep. No disturbances. In the morning I went to front desk to get a shower cap.
I think the gentlmens name whom I talked to was Dallam. He could not find one but promised me that as soon as the staff comes he would drop off one in my room and which he did. Now this gentlemen was amzaing. Extremely courteous and apologized several times for not being able to find a shower cap right away for me. A true role model for customer service.

The property does not have beach acess, but you can follow a path through neighboring hotel properties to reach stairs to the beach.  It's nice if you just want to walk around the beach, but if you have a lot of gear (as we do with the kids) you'd be better off driving over to the pier area.

Jim T,25,"Carlsbad, California",2013-03-31,FAMILY,2013-03-25,4,"Wonderful View, but Room Choice Matters Greatly","We were on a family trip up the central California coast and chose to spend a night at Pismo Beach to unwind.  We love an unobstructed view of the ocean and the sound of the ocean waves breaking on the rocks; finding a quiet, private spot to enjoy the ocean horizon and sound of the sea was our goal.  I found what looked like a good deal on the Internet (Expedia, prepaid rate) and booked a room that was advertised as having an ocean view.  The sample room photo showed an unobstructed view of the ocean off the balcony, so I figured we were all set for peaceful bliss.

We arrived at the hotel in mid-afternoon, and promptly checked in.  The front desk agent (manager?) welcomed us warmly, and gave me a key to a second-floor room in the tower.  The hotel is configured as an ocean-front block (where the lobby is located) and a separate tower with three wings.  Our assigned room was located near the center of the tower, with a view that was partially blocked by an adjoining wing of the tower and directly overlooking the busy pool.  The ocean was visible from the balcony, but off in the distance past the pool.  It was definitely not what we thought we had booked, and did not afford us the relaxing, quiet ocean experience we were expecting.

I promptly went back to the front desk and expressed my concerns.  The agent (manager?) insisted that we had booked an ""ocean view"" room on Expedia, and that the Expedia room was not an ""ocean front"" room.  I was aware that she had me over a barrel because the rate was prepaid, and the payment had already been made before we arrived.  To her credit (and the hotel's), she offered me a different room with a slightly different bed configuration (2 queens vs. 1 king) in the ""ocean front"" block as a replacement, for the same price.  After checking it out, we found that the new room was more like what we thought we had originally booked, and accepted it.

Once in the room, our experience was excellent.  The room was recently renovated, clean, comfortable, well-decorated and generally quiet.  We enjoyed the view and the sound of the waves, and even had a visit from a curious seagull.  The beds were comfortable and offered a good night's sleep.  We ordered dinner from a local Italian restaurant using the in-room delivery service, which we enjoyed on the balcony.  All in all, it was a fabulous evening.

Some notes:  The in-room wireless Internet was free and worked, but wasn't very fast-- about equal to a slower DSL line.  It was able to accommodate all of my devices, including two phones and a tablet.  There are vending machines with sodas in multiple locations, although they carry different products.  For example, the vending machine at the pool end of the ""ocean front"" block has only Pepsi products, but the vending machine in the tower carries Coca-Cola products.  If you book your room through a service like Expedia, pay careful attention to the type of room, as ""ocean view"" and ""ocean front"" apparently mean different things, and the difference is significant.",Make sure to book an &quot;Ocean Front&quot; room if you want a view of nothing but the ocean.,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,12

Even when in the room you can still get a good view through the floor to ceiling window. Our room was large with a high level of cleanliness and with attractive furnishings in excellent condition. The bathroom was spotless. There were no fingerprints all over the window - I wish this could be so in some other hotels. The light and airy lobby was equally attractive and well presented. We found the staff at the front desk both efficient and friendly and more than willing to offer helpful suggestions for dining, etc.

The door to our room opened onto an outside covered walkway and this could be accessed from the ground level either by elevator or stairs. We had no problem with noise from people passing outside the room or from people in the adjoining room. All you could hear was the noise of crashing waves ! There are 2 computers/printers for guest use in the lobby with good internet access and there is also complimentary wifi in the bedrooms. On the whole the wifi worked well in our room but it did on several occasions drop - perhaps we were at the edge of the hotels wifi range.

A complimentary breakfast is available in a spacious area that has plenty of tables and chairs. The choice covers cereals, breads, pastries, hard boiled eggs, fruit, yogurts plus pre packaged chicken biscuits that can be heated up in the available microwave. Coffee, tea and juices are also available. The food is well set out and presented and was replenished regularly - I just wish the staff here could have looked as if they vaguely enjoyed their job - not a smile or a word to anyone.

I am glad that you enjoyed the wildlife around the property.  I hope that you will give us another try someday and find the quiet and relaxing stay you were seeking.  I believe that the overall experience, especially the room itself will lead you to provide us that second chance.

packyourheart,159,"Bakersfield, California",2013-03-31,COUPLES,2013-03-20,5,"Beautiful property, great service, gorgeous location!","First off let me say, the grounds for this hotel are absolutely beautiful, the area in the back of the hotel is to die for and the gazebo...  What a gorgeous view (and a wonderful place for a wedding ceremony).  The room itself is nice, updated linens, LG flat screen, decent decor, fridge, microwave, coffee maker with pretty good Seattle's Best coffee and Tazo tea from Starbucks as well as Bath and Body works toiletries.  The room is also very clean, roomy, and has a nice comfy capret.  It is large and has a balcony, all the rooms have an ocean view.  We stayed in room 222 which is considered a ""partial ocean/partial pool view"" but from our balcony it was ocean water as far as the eye could see.  I was so impressed with this hotel, the entire property is clean and nice and updated.  The property is full of beautiful flowers and green grass.  I was so happy that we chose to stay here instead of the Edgewater (which is where we stayed last time).  
      The staff was so friendly and willing to help it was such a breath of fresh air compared to services usually rendered by hotel staff in a high tourist area.  Every time someone answered the phone at the front desk they were cheery and eager to help, the man who checked us in was pleasant and seemed to like his job (How could you not with that beautiful ocean view in your lobby?).  Later in the night my camera ran out of batteries while we were on the gazebo and when I asked Andrew at the front desk if they sold batteries he said no but came up to our room about 10 minutes later with some batteries he had found, they did not work but he was willing to bring more until we found some that worked.  Now that's dedication and WONDERFUL customer service.  I was blown away by his helpfulness and it solidified that we want to make this hotel our regular place to stay whenever we come to Pismo.
             Although this hotel does not have direct beach access, it is only a short walk down to a hotel that does, and once you get down the crazy stairs to the beach, there are some of the coolest looking cliffs and rock formations.  We paid $189 plus taxes for the room on a Saturday, and I think it was well worth the cash.  
            I have only two complaints about this hotel and it really isn't the hotel's fault.  1) The people in the room above us were letting their children run around like wild animals and it was HIGHLY annoying, I was woke up at 7 a.m. because their kids were stomping across the floor and slamming the screen leading out to their balcony. People please, if you're going to be with your kids on a high floor, make sure they aren't making so much noise, it's very rude and inconsiderate of the people on the lower levels.  2) The restaraunt next to the hotel had an hour and a half wait.  We ended up walking down to Brad's on the main drag.
             While there isn't much right next to the hotel, a short walk will get you to the main tourist area, it took us about 10 minutes to get down to the street where the pier is located. 
              All in all, my husband and I had an amazing experience at this hotel, we thoroughly enjoyed the gazebo and actually ended up spending a lot of our time there.  We took a bottle of champagne down there and just hung out and enjoyed each other's company, even the other hotel patrons were friendly and looked like they were enjoying themselves.  It was a much needed, kid-free, romantic getaway for us and we thank the Shore Cliff Lodge to helping make our weekend that much more enjoyable.  We will definitely be returning to your hotel in a few months and we will be recommending this beautiful property to everyone we know!","If you want a nice ocean/pool view, make sure to get a room on the second or third floor.",5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,FunInSunPismoBeach,General Manager,2013-04-06,"What a great review!  Thank you so much for capturing all the wonderful details at the property.  It is obvious that you take the time to enjoy every detail of the places you visit.  I am certain that every flower catches your senses as does every wave breaking on the bluffs.  Your stay sounds like it was a perfect getaway and we are thrilled to have provided you the accommodations you were seeking.
Andrew and all our staff enjoy assisting the guests and I am glad that he went on a mission to find you some batteries.  
The walk is well worth the beauty of the rocks and beach that are at the bottom of the stairs.  I am glad that you found the joy in the adventure of the walk and the serenity of sipping champagne while sitting under the gazebo.
We look forward to your next visit and let us.

RayinPMC,3,,2013-03-31,NONE,2013-03-18,3,Avoid room 107!,"Stopped in for a sunday nite stay.   The positives:   The staff was pleasant.  The grounds are beautiful and the view spectacular.  I was given room 107,  a ground floor unit with a partial ocean view.  The room was spacious and well appointed.  Amelia, the housekeeper, did a fine job cleaning and preparing the room for my arrival.  All told a decent room at this price level.

The negatives:  The bug screen was partially off it's runner and difficult to slide.  I tried to rerail it but it was stubborn.  Not wanting to damage it I discontinued.  As other reviewers have mentioned,  you can hear every footstep from the guests in the room above.  At sunset I wanted to sit out on the balcony and enjoy the ocean view, but a bright wall-mounted pathway light shone toward my room and spoiled the view.  The light was so intense that I was forced to draw the drapes instead of leaving them open to let the cool ocean breeze in.

One more thing specfic to room 107.  It shares walls with the breakfast room and vending area, so trying to sleep past 7am is impossible.  Relentless banging and knocking sounds denied me any chance of sleeping in.

Most hotels have one room that's noisier than any other.  Unfortunately, I got the short straw in room assignments, otherwise I would have had a much better experience.   If all these problems had surfaced early on I would have asked to change rooms.  In summary, come stay and enjoy Shore Cliff Lodge, but avoid room 107!",,3.0,5.0,,5.0,2.0,5.0,FunInSunPismoBeach,General Manager,2013-04-06,"I sincerely apologize that your stay did not meet your expectations.

I am glad that you found the room itself clean and spacious, but I’m sorry that it was noisy and that the screen door was inoperable.  We will make sure that it has been repaired since your stay.  I will also review the lighting outside that room. This is the first that we have heard of that so we will certainly correct the situation.  Thank you for that feedback.
Again, I appreciate the time you took to provide the feedback and hope that you will provide us the opportunity to provide you with the stay you deserve.

nancy b,119,"Boulder City, Nevada",2013-01-31,FRIENDS,2013-01-05,4,Beautiful Views!,"I found the property to be very well kept, especially since it's right on the water with lots birds around & an ocean view.  The beds were comfortable and there was a microwave & fridge in the nice clean room,  My only complaint in regard to the cleanliness was that the glasses with the cardboard type covers on them which suggest they've been cleaned almost to the point of sterile, were upon a closer look, just scummy dirty.  The one I was about to drink from had sticky stuff all over the sides and inside bottom of it, it was truly nauseating.  I recently saw a TV show about how these glasses are merely wiped out by the house-cleaning staff, not sanitized and saw how true this is firsthand.

The free breakfast was not even possible our first morning, it was so beyond capacity in the very small breakfast room.  We were disappointed with the small selection of options, not even a banana in the fruit selection of oranges & apples.  There was only one toaster and the bread selection was meager as well and the single pancake maker had a line one couldn't even find the end to.  We decided on a bolied egg and a cup of coffee we could leave with since there was not a seat to be had and it was a weekday.  As we approached the two coffee urns with our empty cups, one of the staff grabbed them both to refill them without so much as a word of explanation to us.  We waited and she returned with what was a really good coffee which we got a cup of and removed ourselves from the claustrophobicly crowded room.

Overall the stay was pleasant but we were in a ground floor room with noisy folks above us and I have to say honestly if I came back here I'd request a second floor room next time and ask them if they'd spiffed up their breakfast offerings and moved to a bigger space to accomodate their clientele.",,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,35

Best Westerns are ""individually owned and operated"" but have no fear - this one is in excellent condition. The common areas, pool, and our room were all pristine.
Every room has a fabulous ocean front view at prices which are comparable to the competition (which don't have ocean views).
The rooms are spacious, and none of the ""Euro"" bathroom arrangements - where the sink/s are exposed to the bedroom. Note: this hotel has double sinks rather than a single; what a relief for everyone.
The outdoor pool is huge and really heated - totally luxurious, even when it's a foggy morning.
The breakfast is typical 3 star fare; cereal, yogurt, fruit, waffle machine.
Didn't have much interaction with the staff, but that's okay as we didn't have any problems.
There's no direct access to the beach from the hotel, hence the name. Access is a short drive away.

Steve H,145,"Wigan, United Kingdom",2012-09-30,COUPLES,2012-09-27,4,Quiet & relaxing,"We rounded off our adventure in CA with 3 nights at the Shore Cliff Lodge.

We were in #231 overlooking the ocean and lawns. The room was well laid out, clean and had a comfortable bed. The bathroom was basic but had a respectable shower and again was immaculately clean. The outside balcony was a little weather worn and had quite a bit of bird poop on it together with the large seagull that left it. All in all the room was comfortable.

On the downside the breakfast was something of a scrum down with what is described as a European buffy which wasn't great but was rescued by decent coffee. We used the Cinnamon Rolls shop in town after the first morning. Given that we didn't realise breakfast was included its probably a little crass of us to complain though. The reception staff were a little worn around the edges one with a dirty blouse. During check in there was no eye contact which was a little disconcerting and despite having to walk through reception throughout the stay not once did any of the reception staff look up and acknowledge us.

First, the Pismo Beach area is just lovely. This property sits right at the edge of the cliffs in it's name on Pelican Point. The birds also like it here. The grounds are quite lovely, with paved walking areas to enjoy it all safely and pavilions to sit under with a coffee. The room was lovely and we sat on the balcony listening to the surf (until the bugs discovered us) and then we went inside and the surf lulled us to sleep through the open balcony door. We also enjoyed the hot buffet-style breakfast in the adjacent restaurant the next morning.
This would be a lovely venue for weddings and other formal parties with excellent photo ops.

SusanNYC63,38,"New York City, New York",2012-08-31,FAMILY,2012-08-26,2,Smelly,"Let me start by saying the location of this hotel right on a cliff overlooking the Pacific is spectacular.  Our view was fantastic. Sadly, we had to enjoy it from behind closed windows because of the awful pelican and seagull smell.  I am not sure whether we visited at a particularly bad time, but the entire cliff side is covered with sea bird guano and the entire area around the hotel smells terrible.  Luckily, we were only here for one night on a drive up the coast, but I would have been very disappointed if I had planned to spend more time at this hotel. 
In addition, I did not find Pismo Beach to have much to offer unless you are looking for a tattoo or tequila flavored candy.   I was attracted by the wide sandy beach, which is beautiful, but in retrospect I wish we'd stayed in Morro Bay.
That said, the rooms are large and clean and well-stocked.  There is also a fabulous restaurant next door called the Ventana Grill which has first rate food and certainly one of the best views on the coast.",,1.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,,,,,45

If the view is important to you, be sure to distinguish between ""ocean view/pier view,"" ""partial ocean view"" and ""oceanfront"" when you are booking. We were willing to pay for a renovated room with the best view, but they still tried to put us in a less desirable room. (Front desk people know some rooms are better than others, and they often try to fill their less-than-ideal rooms early, to friendly people, in hopes of minimizing confrontation later. You can call it human nature, but I think it is bad management.)

On arrival we were greeted by a friendly member of staff who told us our room was ready and to go ahead. After a long drive from Monterey i was ready to unwind and relax here. The corridors were being rennovated which was a little disapointing as they were dirty and small. when we got to our room it was quite plain to be honest and not as exclusive as we were lead to believe, however the view was great, not perfect as the sunset was too our right but it was still lovely.
We made our way to the small vista point to watch the sunset and we were th eonly ones there which was nice and private. it was incredible and worth every penny of the room rate just to see that. 
We then made our way to find somewhere to eat and decieded on the restuarant next to the hotel as we couldn't be bothered to make our jounrye into town. After we had to wait 45mins for a table (2 amazing vcocktails later) we had the best meal of our entire trip.

pasadenababy,23,,2012-07-31,COUPLES,2012-08-06,3,Beautiful view - Hotel Average,"We were looking for a hotel last minute for a two night stopover on our way up the coast.  Surprisingly, we called Shore Cliff Lodge and they had availability so we went up that night.  We arrived about 10:45 and there was no one at the front desk or anywhere around.  We called out many times and finally after 15 minutes or so a guy came strolling up the path (it turned he was the front desk clerk and apparently the only one there).   He made no comment about keeping us waiting and just said may i help you, very disinterested.  I told him we'd been waiting quite a while and he said ""oh really"".  Anyway, that wasn't a very good start.  Our room was ocean view and watching the birds was amazing and kept us entertained while it was overcast and cold most of the time.  Apparently, Pismo Beach is known for that sort of cloudy weather in the summer until about Sept/Oct.  The sun finally came out around 3:00 or so.  The hotel room was ok but not great and there were guests in the room next door making quite a ruckus late at night shaking our whole room and bed.  It went on and on and we finally had to complain to the front desk.  We ate dinner at the Ventana Grill next door and it was about $100 for two with average food.  Nothing special.  Anyway, the view is fabulous and the birds were really fun to watch.

My daughter and I usually like to take Highway 101 and break up the trip somewhere along the central coast.  I didn't have a reservation, but did read some reviews on trip advisor before our trip.

It was so easy to find, as it's right off 101 and RIGHT ON the coast.  Lucky for us they had a room available.  I choose to stay in a room that faced the pool.  We were on the first floor, which was fine for one night.  If I were to stay longer, I probably would have asked for a higher floor or an ocean view.  For us it was mainly a pit stop for one night, so I wasn't picky.  The room was very clean and modern.  It was a nice-sized room with one king bed.  There was a flat-screen television and a wet bar with a mini fridge.  The room also had a patio facing the pool.  We didn't use it because we arrived around dinner time and it was extremely foggy that day.

The following morning we had breakfast, which was included in the room price.  There was a big selection of pastries, fruit, yogurt, cereals, and they even had pancakes (from a do-it-yourself machine - we didn't try it, but it looked interesting) - so anything you needed to get a good, healthy breakfast.  After breakfast and prior to checking out, we took a walk on the property, which was stunning.  There is a safe path to walk along the cliffs and look out to the ocean.  We came across a mother seagull and her two babies nesting on the cliff. There were also some adorable bunnies running around the property.

Disneyminion,121,"Aptos, California",2012-05-31,COUPLES,2012-05-29,4,The nicest BW I've ever stayed at,"Had a last minute wedding to attend on Memorial weekend and this was the only hotel that would let us book just one night.  The lobby itself is really nicely done.   The front desk clerk was nice and gave us options of what floor to stay on.  We chose the 3rd building 3rd floor room 315.   

The entry way has a nice tile then it's carpeted.  Nice furnishings and a small balcony with a gorgeous view!  There's two chairs and a table to sit and have coffee at while admiring the view.
The bathroom toiletries are Bath and Body Works which the ladies will appreciated.  Dual sinks and a big mirror behind the door which I loved!  Not many hotels have these.  The towels super soft they must have been brand new.  Thanks BW!  

There's a nice size pool and jacuzzi and it's nicely landscaped.   My only problem with the pool was that early on Sunday morning it seemed there was a cartful of children in the pool crying and screaming.   So if by the pool be prepared not to sleep in.   

My only gripe about the hotel is that when other guests are leaving their rooms when the doors shut it is extremely loud!  

We ate at the Ventana Grill next door and it's a beautiful restaraunt.   Try the fish sandwich and pineapple margarita.  We had a table right next to the window for a nice ocean view.  

If in Pismo beach again I would pick the Shore Cliff Lodge again buy maybe stay in the 2nd building because of the pool noise in the morning.",On the weekends you might want to a room away from the pool area if you want to sleep in.,3.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,General Manager,2012-06-25,"Hi

Jenifer H,7,"Spokane, Washington",2012-05-31,COUPLES,2012-05-28,5,THE Best...totally worth it.,"This must be the best Best Western ever.  I booked by mistake, thinking it was closer to SFO...NOT.  We were exhausted by the time we pulled in, at 1:30 am.  The night clerk was kind, pleasant, welcoming, and didn't even look sleepy.  After a long drive, I really appreciated how calm and helpful he was. It set the tone for a relaxing night's stay.

The beds were very comfortable.  It was May, so leaving the balcony door open to listen to the sea didn't work out so well.  After an hour I closed it and turned on the heating unit, which made a nice white noise and heated things up to a comfortable temperature before long at all.

In the morning we made coffee in the room and sat out on the balcony to look at the view.  We had an oceanfront room, but I could see that the partial oceanview would have been nice also, for even less money.  From them, you could see the pier, which was also a great view.  Our balcony view was, from my research, definitely the nicest view on all of Route 1 for anywhere even near the price. Gorgeous view of waves slapping up against the cliff opposite.

Plus Continental breakfast at the adjoining fancy restaurant, too? The waiters were so kind. Wow.  We felt like we'd lucked out.

While on the balcony that morning, we were visited by the nicest, calmest, and most unobtrusive seagull ever.  He posed beautifully, and never came too near.  When a unit closer to him opened the sliding door, he hopped back a couple of steps and posed like a statue.   Then a baby wild bunny came out from under the bushes to wash her face.  Adorable, and she stayed for pictures, then went under the end of the bush, stretched out, yawned, and slept.  It was clear that these were wild animals and had never been fed or tempted.  What a nice morning.  We relaxed with Jonathan Livingston Seagull and the baby bunny and the ocean waves for an hour, then had breakfast and enjoyed the pier and the nearby dunes, the only place in California where you can drive on the beach.  Fun!!  Then we took Highway 1 to Hearst Castle and back to San Francisco.  What a nice day trip!!  And if you are having a wedding, this would be a dream location...there's a lovely garden that extends out onto the cliff.  The photos would be incredibly gorgeous.

If you're trying to decide whether to drive another hour or 2, or whether to spend another $50 or so, go for this place.  You won't regret it. Nowhere I saw on the whole coast had a better location.  The staff was awesome.  I wouldn't have minded staying another week...and for the price?  I could have afforded to stay another couple of days, and was a bit sorry that I didn't.","The Oceanfront room was totally worth it, but if you&#39;re on a budget, the Partial Ocean View rooms must have a really nice view of the ocean and the pier...just as nice, I bet.  But if you want to be visited by a wild baby bunny and a dignified seagull, as we were, get a room on the ground floor.

Not only did all those great memories come flooding back, but the whole place has been recently remodeled and upgraded.

The front desk staff was gracious enough to upgrade us to a ""pier view room"" for the price of a ""pool view room"".  For a little over $100 we got a gorgeous ocean view, with the morning sun pouring in, and the pier in the distance.

We love the location of this hotel, because you can hear the crashing waves as you fall asleep.  No beach access, but plenty of nice walking paths alongside the cliffs.

Included breakfast was great (not just high-carb, high-sugar offerings).  We also ate dinner the night before at Ventana's, which is the adjoining restaurant, but were disappointed with both the service and food.  It specializes in tequila, and since we were tea-totalling that night, didn't have the enhancement of the tequila buzz to offset the lesser-quality food and service.  Oh well.

I was literally reviewing hotels on my Android as we drove down to Pismo.  My parents like Best Westerns (I try to avoid them) and wanted to stay at this one or the other that is in town.  We chose this one based on the reviews.    

RESERVATIONS & CHECK-IN:  I made our reservations on the phone.  Thankfully there were rooms available at short notice.  The staff was very friendly on the phone and at check-in.  

ROOM:  WOW!!!  We had 2nd floor rooms that faced the ocean. What a STUNNING view.  Even though it was chilly, we opened the door at night to hear the ocean.  Soooo peaceful. Our two queen bed room was very spacious and clean.  The beds were comfortable.  Our room had a refrigerator, microwave and sink area with the typical complimentary make-your-own-coffee. The bathroom was clean and provided a blow dryer.  We had connecting rooms with my parents, which made it easy to go back and forth.  We never watched t.v. because we were too busy playing games together. 

My only complaint was the thin walls.  I could hear my dad snoring and coughing, which made sleep a little uncomfortable.  However, my husband and daughter said it wasn't a problem for them. 

Since this is a MOTEL, not a HOTEL, so I was concerned about car traffic and foot traffic noise.  There were so problems whatsoever.  

BREAKFAST:  We didn't eat the complimentary breakfast because we chose to sleep in and try out some of the local eateries.  (The Honeymoon Cafe was AWESOME.)

OVERALL:   This was a very good motel.  Clean, nice amenities and friendly staff.  There were no problems with birds or smells as mentioned in other reviews.

The hotel or motel, if you ask me, is located by the roadside, but also present it self as a nice three star hotel.
The reception smells like pee, and yes, there is a reason for it. The reason is that the hotel/motel has a huge bird nest mountain below it, which smells so bad you are at all times being close to womit.
The rooms are ok, fearly new, but a terrible AC, and also you stink out your room if you open the balcony door.
I am REALLY surprised to see almost no one else than we are telling other travellers about this.
The ""spa"" treatment center is perhaps the biggest con in history, as it is a small room on 3 by 3 feet.
This hotel is cheap, but not as cheap as it should be.

It provided panoramic views of the ocean from each room. The 3 balconies were attached and very spacious with seating and tables. This room also overlooked the lawns, gazebo walkway and pool. The living room has a full seating area with pullout if needed. In addition it has a Flat screen TV, and a large desk office area. The kitchenette was fully equipped w/ utensils, plates, glasses for drinks & wine, sink and microwave. The kitchen table has seating for four. 
The shower and bath area was average, but stocked w/ Bath & Body Works. We also used the luxury bath robes. 
The suite is a little dated but up kept and clean. The beds are made w/ thick clean linens and nice plush pillows. Every room has a television. We slept in each room during the stay. It was on the second floor, so you can keep the slider open to hear the waves of the ocean crashing all night. All you can see is miles of ocean, because the hotel is situated right on the cliff. 
The walk down to the ocean is a little far and has to be accessed for the neighboring hotel. From that point there is a trail that leads all the way down to very narrow and steep steps to the beach. It takes about 8-10 minutes. You can see the pier from this location and from the beach it would take about 15-20 minutes to walk there. We Did!!! 
The staff gets an A +. We did not have reservations upon check in. They were so kind and considerate. We stayed 3 days and 2 nights. They were also knowledgeable about the area, and accommodated small request with big smiles. This hotel is situated right next to most of the major hotels, such as the Lighthouse Resort. There is an independent restaurant next door that serves free continental breakfast for this hotel. We did not have a chance to try it. The hotel does not have room service or a restaurant, which is a little disappointing.

The airconditioning in our room wasn't noisy, but we were getting vibrations from the airconditioning unit below us, all the way up the wall - fortunately that stopped by the time we went to bed. The only thing that did keep me awake was the hum of the in-room fridge, and the seagulls on the balcony - who knew they would still be up at 2am - obviously that is beyond the control of the hotel!

But if you are looking for a base/overnight stay in Pismo, and don't want to spend a fortune, this is a good choice. The complimentary breakfast in the restaurant next door is fairly basic and could be better, but it's fine.

The access to the beach below is accessible only by the neighboring properties, but this was okay with us and it made this property feel exclusive. A short walk through the other hotel properties on the ocean front side led to a staircase to the beach below.

The amenities are what one would expect in that type of accommodation; just sitting on the cliff face with a bird rookery down below. A word about that...it's fascinating to watch the pelicans, cormorants and gulls come and go - and they come in great numbers at the end of the day - but it also means that you have birdie smells and birdie leavings to contend with.  Not a big problem but if you are sensitive... The continental breakfast, in the morning was not great.  They could use a bit more protein in the mix, but it did the trick.  We have stayed at the sister property, Shelter Cove, a couple of times and I really prefer it.  It is smaller and all of the rooms face the ocean.  However, when I tried to book it, the Best Western reservation site showed it as full.  There were ""vacancy"" signs both nights though.  Lesson learned - call the property directly next time.

There are hundreds of sea birds that roost on the cliffs and on the property and the guano smell can be powerful.  I guess that's the price of being close to nature...  I didn't smell it in my room, however.  The continental breakfast was not bad either - they had hard boiled eggs and oatmeal and not just pastries.

We did not have a reservation, and so we looked around the property before deciding to stay.  We were able to select our room of choice.  The pier view rooms are hit and miss.  If you get a good one on the 3rd floor, the views are great!  If you are stuck on the inner corner on the first floor, its probably a bit disappointing.  We had a great room on the third floor an the views were truly spectacular.  I could see the ocean from my bed in the morning.  

I agree that the breakfast was kind of a joke.  It is extremely busy and too small to accommodate all of the guests.  When we got there most of the good food had been picked over and all of the hot food was gone.  The servers were not rude as some people say, but overwhelmed with the volume of guests.  breakfast at this hotel is a bit weak.  

The other drawback is the lack of beach access, although the stunning views make up for it.  

That being said, if you get a good room, and dont mind the crazy breakfast, its actually a good value.  it is a stunning location and by far the nicest Best Western i have ever stayed at.  It is all about what you want and expect from your hotel.  if you want to be in town and be right down on the beach, its not for you.

The room was very clean and attractive - attention given to detail (lovely ""fan folds"" on the top tissue in the tissue box, ice bag, bathroom linens folded attracticely, etc - Ammenities were from Bath & Bodyworks.  

We so enjoyed the view from our room - and having our door open all day and night!  It was wonderful to not only see the waves, watch the surfers and see the coastline and pier (and fog at times!) - but to hear the waves also.  It was wonderful to have chairs on our deck to ""just sit"" - something we rarely have the priviledge of doing.  Also, we asked for extra tea bags at the lobby and they graciously supplied those.

One draw back - was that with our door open,  ""neighbors"" had a midnight meal - either near their open door or on their deck.  That was disruptive and not a problem of the hotel, but . . rather the guest - but . . it was enough noise (talking, crumpling of foil and trash, etc) to wake us up.  Also, someone was smoking on their deck several times during our stay and that smoke came into our non-smoking room - annoying (and allergy irriatating).  

The contential bfst was ""OK"" - waffles, oranges/apples, cold cereals, toast, llimted pastries, and tea and coffee.  We were disappointed that only the bar area was open for eating - not the dining room.  There were lots of people and the bar area was very crowded.",,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,,,,,96

However, i was assured that my view from the spot given would not only not be interrupted by the tree (turned out to be only 1), but is actually BETTER than most. Boy were they right... i could see most of the oceanfront, the entire south side of the coast, and the pier. This would be a GREAT place to stay on the 4th of July... wow! 

The rooms were large, and the bathroom in the single king room had two sinks and PLENTY of space for those who find that important.

I'd probably give the staff a 1 star rating.  My financee's Aunt booked a suite, but some how the Shore Cliffs screwed up and didn't book us our suite so we had bump her out of her room.

The Continental Breakfast at the Ventana Grill was pretty good.

We didn't have the Pelican smell, I've been to the Shore Cliff's numerous times.  Sometimes it smells bad, sometimes it's not so bad.  It seemed worse when I was visiting last fall.

If you are having your wedding reception here, I would not recommend having your guests stay here.

Contrary to some remarks written by other travellers (which worried us before we came to stay there!), there was no rusty furniture on the balcony or the patio, and as for bird droppings... it's a hotel on the very edge of the ocean, so there are a lot of seagulls everywhere, and of course they leave their marks everywhere!

The room was clean, with a comfortable bed, a big telly, a little kitchenette with a fridge and a microwave (!), so we felt sorry that we didn't stay longer. And, of course, the view is fantastic (although the weather was not good enough to enjoy it fully!). 
There was only one small problem: the advertised included breakfast was non-existent. To get it, we had to go to a building some distance away, and when we got there, it was overcrowded and there was no space to sit. As for the food, there wasn't enough of it! You could only have a tired old muffin or queue for a long time to make your own waffle or toast. The tea was luke warm and no place to have it anyway! so we looked at it and walked away.

The hotel staff were very helpful and friendly providing good information about local restaurants and getting around.  There are a couple of restaurants within walking distance from the hotel (and it felt quite safe walking to and from them) and I would definitely recommend a visit to the Cracked Crab restaurant which is in the main town (about 5 minutes drive) where they serve a big bucket of crabs on the table - certainly a novel experience - good fun and good food!",,4.0,4.0,,4.0,5.0,5.0,,,,,33

This is a very romantic hotel and even the free basic continental breakfast (coffee/danishes/muffins/oatmeal and juice) was romantic in the morning as you could eat in the restaurant overlooking the ocean and cliffs. I didn't experience any problem with the seagulls or pelicans...they tended to stay down on the beach and rocks. The more expensive rooms seemed to have more birds in that area!

ljweez,9,,2009-11-30,SOLO,2009-11-09,4,A diamond in the rough,"The rooms are a little rough around the edges--cheap looking construction, finishes, and appointments, tired decor, cracked tiles, scuffed walls. I'm usually picky about such things, but I couldn't care less for all the pluses of this place: primarily, an exquisite location on a cliff looking over the ocean. The weather was so balmy that I was able to leave the balcony door open all night and was lulled to sleep by the sound of the waves crashing onto the cliffs. For $98 a night ! I don't know where else you can get an ocean-front room anywhere in California for that price.

Pluses:
* Spacious room with amazing ocean views, including stunning sunset
* Great grounds, paths, gazebo, lawn, all set at the edge of the cliff with gorgeous viws
* Bath & Body Works toiletries
* Tazo ""Calm"" caffeine-free tea in the room (not your usual generic cheap  stuff)
* An insulated in-room coffee maker that actually keeps your coffee hot
* Great little balconies with table and chairs to enjoy the ocean view
* Free breakfast
* Motel-style convenience--I was in Room 127 on the bottom floor and was able to park right in front of my room
* Nice pool and hot tub surrounded by a glass fence to block the wind but not the view
* Easy freeway access but with no noticeable noise (the crashing waves mask any other noise)
* Five decent pillows on the bed
* An abundance of decent towels
* Free  wireless Internet
* Free L.A. Times in the lobby
* Pelicans everywhere, they are hilarious!

Minuses:
* I could not order up a movie--something wrong with the cable
* Restaurant was closed for rennovation (but continental breakfast was still available)
*  No beach access, as the hotel is set on a cliff. You can walk down the coast a ways to access the beach from neighboring hotels.
* Not near the downtown area with its shops and stuff, though within a reasonable walking distance to a Marie Callendar's and Steamers.",,5.0,4.0,,5.0,3.0,4.0,,,,,7

The quiet we were looking for wasn't really there due to the large number of seagulls which seem to love the hotel roof, pool, gardens, your balcony etc.    The smell was aweful and with all the droppings I felt it could be a health and safety issue especially around the pool. It's definately ok for a one night stopover, but that's all.

AMAZING  SUNSETS.On Saturdays there are a lot of weddings, at least 4 a day so if you get a room with an ocean view and don't want to look at weddings all day ask for a room that does not face the wedding area. Since this hotel is along the cliffs there are a ton of Pelicans and Seagulls which will annoy you at the pool. You can't really relax at the pool because of the fear of getting pooped on(that was the only disappointing part of the hotel) The seagulls get a little crazy sometimes and you can hear them almost all day, they die down at night, but if your a light sleeper you probably won't be able to sleep with the window open. All in all, If your looking for a upgraded hotel, with nice rooms, all the amenities, and a ocean view give this hotel a shot!

This hotel is one you would expect to be a  Motel but clean and useable.  The Hotel is on the main highway at the back and front is absolutely infested with Seaguls and Pelican - at first the smell is overwhelming but with time you get used to it, the noise of the birds isnt great but at night they are pretty quiet so you can live with it.

The Gym is 4 pieces of kit that are rusty and not working too well but you can get a 45 min workout at a push.

Next door is a seafood resturant that is absolutely fine nothing special but does the job and the service is good.

So we paid over $200 (with tax) for a room with two (surprisingly small) queen beds and an ocean view across the pool. It was large, it was clean, it was utterly bland, though you couldn't say it was quiet with all the seagull noise throughout the night (even with the sliding patio door closed). There were an enormous number of pelicans in residence when we stayed, which I thought was the one distinctive feature of the place. It made me think that the site ought to be a state park instead of a motel! 

One thing to know is that there is absolutely nothing off-site that you can walk to from this location--the motel is isolated along a sidewalk-free freeway frontage road.

The actual hotel is just off the main road (although we didn't hear any traffic at night in the room) so it's very accessible.  It was very busy when we stayed as e did struggle to find a parking space but I think there had been a wedding on that day.

This is the sort of place you would stop at as a 1 night stop over and does have a motel feel about it, having said this; we found the rooms to be very clean and really big.

Ours overlooked the pool area and had a kitchenette including a fridge and sink in it as well as a large wardrobe and a very large bathroom.  We asked for a king size bed when we checked in and the staff were very accommodating.

Te hotel is a shirt car journey from the centre of Pismo, which had a surfer feel about it.  The town is quite small but we found an excellent Italian bistro called Two Blocks from the Ocean, which is on the main road into Pismo and was fab!!  The staff were very accommodating and we had to wait at the bar to be seated for around 30 mins but the owner kept checking we were okay.  This place had a very homely feel about it and wasn't mega expensive.

The other reviews I’ve read complain about the smell from the pelicans, but we didn't really notice anything.

We didn't eat in the hotel in the evening but we did eat breakfast, which was lovely, the staff were very attentive and it was good value for money.

jc76,53,,2008-03-31,FRIENDS,2008-04-17,3,"Confusing room rates, over all a bit of a disappointing stay.","I am rather confused about the rate this hotel charges as I had booked 3 rooms for 6 of us, and they were all the same category of room, and booked in a single booking.  I would have therefore assumed that the rates should have been identical. However on check out the amount we were charged was significantly different.  I paid the most for my room, but as I was charged the amount that the reservation had stated I did not feel I could complain.  For the 3 night stay, one room was about $90 less and the other $150 less. So there may be bargains to be had, as it seems to be rather hit and miss as to what they feel like charging.

As for the hotel itself, I had stayed here once before about 4 years ago and at the time had been very impressed with it, this time my experience was slightly less favourable.  My room seemed rather shabby over all, I imagine it has not been decorated since my last stay and was therefore showing 4 years of use.  There were problems with the bathroom plumbing, requiring a maintenance visit on two occasions.  Both times the repair man came out very quickly and neither repair took too long.  I did also have a problem with finding a free working socket to charge my camera battery, the 4 spare wall ones in the room did not work, only the one in the outer bathroom area were usable.

I also had problems with noise from loud spring-breakers next door who came in at 1 am and then partied loudly until about 5am.  I realise that this is not the fault of the hotel though, but as a warning, noises from neighbours through adjoining doors can be very loud.

What this hotel does have going for it is the great view of the ocean (as do the others near by) and during my stay I saw both dolphins and seals in the waters below. The pool and spa are also nice.",,3.0,,,4.0,2.0,3.0,,,,,81

Don't limit your search just to hotels.com either -- there are tons of properties that don't show up there.  Save your vacation -- stay away from this place.  I've never written a review before ... but I feel people must be warned.  The pictures they show only tell 1/2 the story.  The views drew me in and that's why I took a chance.

If you want to be by the banging pool gate, the spa where teens gather until midnight, kids yelling all day in the pool, then by all means. But...there are a couple of wings where you can be away from the pool and facing the magnificence of the Pacific, looking down froma  90-foot bluff on Pismo Beach sweeping into the distance. I spent one night in the former room. The management graciously (and without objection) allowed us to transfer rooms and the result was night and day. From the hum of pool equipment at night, we went to crashing surf. Overall, the walls are very thin at this older hotel, but if you get on a top floor away from the pool, this is a great place. The smell mentioned in other notes may be from the fact this is perched on Pelican Point. Aptly named. There are HUNDREDS of pelicans, sea gulls and other seabirds perched all over the cliffs. They smell. They intimidated my daughter (14), but I thought it was an amazingly slice of Pacifica. You could even see pods of dolphins swimming in the rocks below, and surfers on Pismo Beach's wave.

Before leaving we felt that Pismo Beach would be a good place to spend the night.  So, I called around and realized that there were rooms available at various hotels.  Reading the reviews on this site, I felt that Mission Inn for $149/night was a decent price for what we'd be getting- a new hotel with creature comforts and breakfast.  But when we got to Pismo Beach around 7:30pm on a Monday night, as we were driving around town, there were many hotels with Vacancy signs.  I picked a three places and decided to call.  I called the two Best Western hotels and a guy named Paul said that they are running a special for $99/night.  At that point we knew that we wouldn't be doing much other than sleeping, so decided to go take a look.  The lobby looked fine, he offered us a ocean/pool view room on the first floor (rm. 117).  As we entered, we thought it was absolutely great for the price.  Not only that, the bed was comfortable, bathroom with two sinks- very spacious, and smelled just fine.

Like some other Best Westerns it looks a bit tired from the front but once you get inside the rooms are really nice and our two had a fantastic ocean view. The rooms came with a balcony that did, admittedly, have some poo on it, but it wasn't all that bad and couldn't be smelled inside the room.

The garden at the back of the hotel was lovely and a couple were getting married when we turned up. Down at the bottom a fair few seagulls were pottering about, complete with babies, while the pelicans seemed content half way down the cliff. They barely moved the whole time we were there - a bit of a downer for my mum - so I have problems believing other reviews that say they are in the pool and a bit pushy. 

We only stayed one night but it was a good all around experience and we'd recommend it highly to others.

RDCollins,44,"Hermosa Beach, California",2006-08-31,BUSINESS,2006-09-27,4,Central Coast Bargain,"This hotel was an exceptional value. I travel frequently on business, and I usually search out the best deal I can find for a 4- or 5-star hotel. Although the Shore Cliff is rated only 3 or 3.5 stars, that's a little misleading. True, it looks like a pretty average motel from the outside, but the rooms have been tastefully remolded, they're far nicer than the exterior of the property suggests, and they are quite comfortable with nice ocean views. They're also very quiet, which is essential for me -- unless you count the crashing surf on the rocks 100 feet below the rooms. 

One thing I especially like in a hotel is having a good restaurant on the property so I don't have to drive after a good meal. The Pelican Point Bar and Restaurant immediately next to the hotel is a superb value for dinner, and the hotel includes a free Continental breakfast at the restaurant (coffee, juice, rolls, bagels, and fruit). I understand that the restaurant wasn't too good in the recent past, but the current owners do a great job. The food is first-rate, the service is generally excellent, there's a nice selection of uncommon central coast wines, the prices are very reasonable, and the view is spectacular!

Lastly, there are the pelicans! A huge flock of the birds populate the cliffs around the hotel, and you can get very close to them. They're really quite amazing, with an uncannily intelligent look on top of a preposterous body, and their flight is magical. One caution -- the cliffs are covered with pelican guano, which smells a bit. Aside from that, the place would make a great base for a long weekend of exploring the wonderful central coast of California.

Fantastic views and no complaints about the room after we asked to be moved having spent first night  listenening to a very noisy air-con unit and liftshaft.Staff were very helpful and willing to please. The main problem with this hotel is the unnerving bird population . Everywhere you look - seagulls and pelicans and do they smell! The roof was covered, not only with these filthy creatures but also their droppings. They were fearless too and quite often took a swim in the pool, even when humans were present. Needless to say, we didn't venture into the pool or jacuzzi, especially when we saw the floating poo. The entire hotel complex stunk , even the restaurant, precariously perched above the crashing waves. By the end of our stay, I was completely fed up with not only the smell, but also the sound of birds at all hours of the day and night. This hotel is worthy of an overnight stay, but no longer. Such a shame as its location is superb, as long as you have transport. We would recommend Avila Beach, a short drive up the coast - great beach, clean and NO BIRDS!

pjones,1,,2006-06-30,FAMILY,2006-07-27,1,Will not go back,"I booked two rooms for one night on July 24, 2006.  This was my first experience with west coast beaches but was visiting my son and family who is stationed in Lemoore NAS in California so we wanted to do the beach thing while we were there.  I was impressed with the Shore Cliff website and made my decision based on it and the view and phots depicted there.  Upon arrival only  one of the two rooms were ready even though it was after 3:00 pm.  The rooms were ""O.K."" - nothing special that deserved the $249 a night price.  The room air conditioners were noisy and you were charged for the bottled water in the rooms.  The rooms had a horrible odor that we later figured out was coming from all of the Pelican crap that literally covered everything - from the balconies to the roof tops of all of the buildings.  My worse finding was the pool area.  We walked out to the gazebo area (where all of the lovely wedding photos were shown) and the odor of massive amounts of bird poop was sickening.  I am not exaggerating when I say that it took my breath.  I simply cannot imagine a wedding being held there because you were surrounded by massive numbers of these smelly birds and huge amounts of Pelican poop! The beaches in this area of central California are quite cold compared to the lovely east coast beaches we were use to, so we were looking forward to the heated pool.  When we arrived with our grandson I would not allow him to get into the pool because not only were there four or five huge pelicans swimming in it (and they had no fear of humans and made no attempt to fly away) but the bottom of the pool was full of pelican poop.  We later went to the ""Pelican"" restaurant for dinner.  $200.00 dollars later we were served fillet migon overcooked and dry fish because they were all out of the prime rib.  We had to wait for 45 minutes to get into a half empty restaurant.  All in all, the view was good - for just the afternnon as the fog was so heavy in the am you could not see the beach - but I would not reccomend this hotel to anyone.  The balcony was leaning slightly forward with just one wooden beam running underneath and moved as you walked on it.  Not safe in my opinion.  The hotel as a whole was old and in need of repairs.  I have read some of the other reviews and I truly thought they must be speaking of a different place because it couldn't be the same place we stayed.  I could not wait to leave and left feeling ripped off - on many levels.  The biggest memory I will take away from our stay was the smell of the Pelican poop and how it was on everything from the rooms, the linens and even in the restaurant.  I checked out some of the other hotels and there are many more in the Pismo area that are cleaner and have just as good a view - if not better.

Looks like they were taken before the recent remodel. This place is SUBERB; really an unbelievable value for the price. One of the nicest hotel rooms I have ever stayed in, and I've stayed in some doozies. You could still smell the fresh paint, so everything was brand-spanking new. Marble bath. Pretty furniture. Comfy bed. A tile-floored balcony (believe me, concrete would have been fine -- but this just indicates how all-out great the room was). Excellent soundproofing. We left our balcony slider open all night and slept to the sound of the surf. Aaaaah. Didn't hear a peep from the rest of the hotel. Peace and quiet and a gorgeous view, sparkling clean and comfortable accommodations, nice walkways along the cliffs where you can see sea birds nesting and watch the surf crash below. The only drawback was the breakfast, which [---]-- weak coffee, watered-down juice -- but the setting was, again, spectacular. We drank our weak coffee while watching otters play in the surf below the restaurant, which is cantilevered out over the water. Would we stay here again? In a heartbeat.

The check in staff were very helpful and friendly and seemed really interested in what we wanted from our stay. The room was great -- large with fridge and microwave, a huge bathroom and safe deposit box. We had a great view onto the ocean, and could have spent all night just looking at the view. The Gazebo right on the cliff edge makes a beautiful location to watch the sun set. There is no restuarant attached to the hotel but the one close by did just the trick. It was on the expensive side, but the food was excellent and worth it. Breakfast is supplied(free on production of a voucher) at the same place and we found this to be good with lots of choice and fresh produce. I had the best cup of tea all holiday here as I was able to make it myself!! Would use this hotel again.

The rooms were spacious and clean. The bed was comfortable. Room had fridge and microwave.  The pool was great!!  Front desk staff was very friendly.  The view was awesome! My only complaint was that the restaurant (the only one within walking distance) was not taking any more reservation and they stopped room service at 8:30.  No one told us this and we had to drive into town on July 4th to get food.  No parking in town so had to go in and order while other person drove around and around till we came out and then took subway sandwichs to room  to eat.  Breakfast was included at same restaurant but it was not much.  Even the oatmeal was packaged and you mixed with hot water.  Pastries were stale, etc,etc.  I would highly reccomend this hotel but stay away from the restaurant.  We probably ended up on the good end because we looked at the dinner menu later at it was very overpriced and very little variety.  I would definatly stay here again but if it was a holiday, I would bring food with me and not rely on the restaurant or getting it from town.

Those who stayed: Me (27), Husband (29), and our 2 daughters, ages 6 and 3.

This was mine and my daughters' second stay here and a first for hubby.  We checked in to room 121 with absolutely no problems.  Got to room, unpacked, checked out the view.  Last time we stayed here we were in room 119 which was a handicapped room.  Every room at this hotel has an ocean view with its own balcony.  Very nice!  Staff was great, room was cleaned impeccably every day, was a great place to stay again!  Only problems we had was both days they never gave us our wakeup call which means the first day we missed the free breakfast at the Pelican and the second day, we ALMOST missed it.  Breakfast includes hard boiled eggs, waffles, danishes, croissants, apple juice, oj, cranberry juice, milk, ice water with lemons in it, assorted cereals and coffees and teas, apples, bananas and oranges, and several varieties of yogurt.  Was very nice!!  Highly recommend for families and those wanting a little romance!

TravelinGirl,38,"Rocklin, California",2006-06-30,BUSINESS,2006-06-20,5,Bird/nature lover's paradise---WOW!,"My husband and I just returned from a 2 night stay.  We got a GREAT deal through Travelocity @ $90 per night for a king sized, ocean front room.  We were somewhat skeptical due to the fact that it's a ""Best Western"".....I'm a Hyatt/Hilton type girl.  However, we got such a great deal and it had such wonderful pics/reviews posted here that we decided to go for it.  

The staff was accomodating.  The room was spacious and updated (although there was a strong deodorizer smell, which was gone in a few hours by leaving the slider open).  The view was TO DIE FOR!  It was incredible!!!  The ocean sounds were great....left the slider open all night long to hear the sounds of the waves crashing against the cliffs.  Occasional bird sounds throughout the night, but no traffic sounds (and yes, it is next to a 4 lane highway, but it's Pismo beach, not Los Angeles).  The continental breakfast was quite suitable.  My only complaint is the bed was old, soft and a couple springs popped occasionally.

However, we absolutely adored being able to see (from our balcony!) sea otters, dolphins, cormorants, seagulls, pigeons, pelicans, hawks!!!!  WOW!  It was amazing!  We've been on two whale watching trips in Monterey and never saw this much wildlife!  There were baby seagulls everywhere.  We saw a hawk attack a pigeon and a seagull chase/attack the hawk, which of course saved the pigeon's life!  We saw dolphins all over the place.....right below our hotel!  What an experience.  Plus, gorgeous sunsets.....whew!  What else can you ask for?!  

Have a great trip!

Rooms were clean and nicely decorated and the bathroom was huge which we found handy.  Beds were comfortable and we had a fabulous view of Pismo beach itself and the ocean.

Felix Stowe,276,"Cuckfield, United Kingdom",2006-06-30,NONE,2006-06-13,3,Ok but nothing special,"There have been some good and bad reviews posted - our experience was somewhere in the middle.

The main selling point for us was the location - our room (like most/all of the others) had a view of sea and cliffs. The hotel has a small garden area but no direct access to the beach.

Our room was ok but smaller and less well equiped than others we stayed in on this trip but that wasn't surprising as this hotel was cheaper. The air conditioning unit was incredibly noisy but fortunately we didn't really need it on. My general impression was that the hotel is run on a very tight budget and decoration is not a priority.

The pool area was unusual in that you need to have your room card to access it. My card wouldn't open the gate but fortunately someone let me in. There were no clean towels at the pool and the changing room was dirty.

The hotel has free internet access via a PC in the reception area.

On our deal breakfast was included and taken at the adjacent Pelican Restaurant. The quality and range of breakfast items was very good.

The hotel is next to a few others on the cliffs but there didn't appear to be any eating places nearby other than the Pelican. The microwave would be a good option especially with the option of eating on the balcony. Instead we opted to walk along the beach (access is about 200 yards down the road and a rickety stairway) for about half a mile and try one of the cafes by the pier.

So as we say in the UK it was a curate's egg - good in parts.

The rooms were very clean and the largest we had stayed while in america, having previously stayed in a hilton. They were spacious, had satellite TV, microwave and a fridge. The staff were very friendly and accomodated our needs when requesting to stay an extra night. The use of the internet was free and available, this allowed us to book the next hotel on our travels up to SF. The view from the room was really nice, watching the seals and dolphins will always be a memory!
The complimentary breakfast was ok, a small selection but it was enough.
The hotel is located a little out of the centre of town, however there isnt really alot in the town, a pier and a few shops. However there are shopping centres about 10mins car journey away that were good.
This was probably the best hotel out of the five that we stayed in, would definately recommend it!

Stay21780,1,,2006-05-31,NONE,2006-05-10,1,Stay away from the Cliff,"This was one of the worst experiences I've had.  I originally made my reservation on line.  I selected a room with an ocean front view, second floor with two queen beds.  When I received my confirmation it was for a king size bed.  So I called the hotel explained the situation and gave them my confirmation number.  The receptionist was not pleasant and that should have been my first clue.  She changed the reservation gave me a different confirmation.  I had stayed at the Cottage Inn a month before and really like the hotel but was not happy with the fact that they do not have an elevator.  I have a back problem so carrying the bags up and to the second floor was not comfortable. The Shore cliff advertised an elevator.  When we arrived we were given a room on the bottom floor and since there was no elevator and the room had a patio I decided to stay.  The room was the one closest to the restaurant and there was a wedding going on.  All of the people attending the wedding passed in front of our patio it was like a parade with all of the noise and cigarette smoke it was awful.  The view was awesome but I felt like I was on display.  The piece and quiet you go to the beach for was shattered.  Also the people staying at the hotel were smoking on the patios and balconies.  So I decided that two nights of this at 259.00 plus a 25.00 dollar a night fee of some sort was not worth it.  I went to the front desk and canceled my second night.  The desk clerk did not even ask if there was a problem.  She just canceled the second night.  At this point I ask her if there were any other rooms available.  She was the one I spoke to earlier when I ask for a room upstairs, her response to me was that I didn't ask for a different room earlier.  At that point a young man came out from the back and she then told me there was another room that had just been cleaned and  I could take a look at that one.  The second room was closer to the pool which was also noisy but was better that the parade. They did not have any vending machines to even get water nor did they offer any complimentary water.  The Cottage Inn had water in the room for us and they had a better continental breakfast.  On the second day the of the continental breakfast at the Shore Cliff we didn't make it till 8:45 and they were already out of half of the items and did not offer to get any more for us.  The breakfast was suppose to be available till 9:30.  If you want a pleasant experience in Pismo beach do not stay at the Shore Cliff Lodge.

we were allocated a room adjacent to the building works, and although the room was lovely as it had been recently refurbished, the smell of plaster and dust was overwhelming. they also start the building work at 8am so we requsted a room change

we got a room in a much nicer position, not refurbished, but more than acceptable with a nice balcony with a sea view (original room was overlooking pool)

however, what you can't see from the photos is that the motel backs onto the freeway, so you enter your room with the freeway behind you, however rooms were well insulated and we couldn't hear the traffic

breakfast was good, plenty of choice, but they close promptly at 9:30am !

there isn't really much to do in Pismo Beach. next time we'd look in Cambria which had some nice B&Bs and lots of bistro type restaurants

our only disappointment was that they didn't tell us there were building works going on when we booked back in the UK some 3 months earlier.

This is a good choice - huge rooms, big bathroom, fridge, microwave.. and balcony with a wonderful view of the ocean.

There was some construction work taking place although this didn't cause any disruption.

There wasn't a great deal to do in the surrounding area so although this made a great overnight break I didn't want to stay any longer (although I heard some guests saying they wish they could've spent at least a week there!)

All areas of the property were clean and secure - staff were friendly and helpful.

BOBJP,39,,2005-11-30,NONE,2005-12-15,4,"Wonderful views, good rooms, decent breakfast","We stayed here on an overnight stay as part of our tour through California.  Whatever you do, ensure that you reach the hotel in time to check in and then see the sunset, as it is beautiful.

The rooms themselves are excellent - and all have balconies that overlook Pismo Beach and the abovementioned fantastic view.

There is also a really good pool and spa (the pool is a bit chilly at first, but you can soon warm up in the spa).

Breakfast (in the dining facility next door) provided a wide range and was very enjoyable.  Make sure you eat at a window seat overlooking the bay - with a little luck you will get to see dolphins playing in the bay while you dine.

Back to the previous evening - and eating.  We'd been tipped off that the town of Pismo was a bit of a walk (there did seem to be a range of places to eat there), so we bought food and drink so that we could have a picnic on the balcony whilst watching the sunset - and we were so glad we did so.

If there is a slight downside, the quality of the staff was a little erratic.  We either got someone really clued up, or someone that barely knew their way around the front desk, let alone the reception area or anything about the hotel!

But don't let this spoil your stay - it was a great overnight stay and would make a good base for local touring, as long as you're happy to take a hike to town to eat in the evening.

Self-serve breakfast was included in our booking at the adjacent restaurant.  The breakfast selection was relatively wide including hard-boiled eggs, choice of cereal, yogurt, bagels, fresh fruits, toasts, coffee and tea.

The views from this hotel is truly breathe taking.  We got up early just to watch the sunrise.  There is a nice looking pool but it was too cold to give it a try.  Pismo beach was visible from the hotel but we didn't get a chance to stroll along there as we hurried towards San Francisco.  We needed a comfortable night in a nice big bed with a view after spending a few nights in an old motel in Hollywood.  We got what we needed and paid for what we got too.

I have stayed at Embassy Suites a lot and would rather have this continental breakfast with this view literally on the edge of a cliff...look down and all you see is water, than cooked to order omelette in an enclosed room.  Slept with sliding doors open listening to waves. I got an internet rate of $89 from the Shore Cliff website, but also called to see what rate I could get....which was $149.

We first checked in the day before the wedding. Given our room key... to a room number that didn't exsist. After hiking around searching we go back and ask where we are going and all they say is... ""oops"".  Once in our room... it was nice enough. Expected a little more for what we paid. (I have learned over our 3 week honeymoon, BWs are just glorified Motel 6s with a Hilton price) Bed nearest the ocean view was broken down and I landed on my rear.  The bathroom sink was incredibly tiny and its shared with the coffee station and closet.  There wasn't even enough room for my husbands shaving kit. It was cool to sit on the bed and watch whales breeching just off the coast. That was really... WOW. But that was all.

When my mother checked in we went to check out here room.  All I can say is night and day!  Her room had a huge double sink bathroom with heat lamps.  A huge frosted glass and wood door leading into the bathroom. A seperate area with the coffee pot, fridge, and microwave. The room was definately what WE expect to get.  There was even patio furniture on the balcony which our room did not have.  

The funny thing is... the 2 rooms were booked by my husband at the same time at the same price.  There was definately a serious difference.

Hints: Ask for a double queen room in the newer south tower.  Anything between 300-310 is great.  

As for the restuarant and catering. One word... lousy.  I would share more... but its really not worth the effort.

Weddings are beautiful there and you pay for that great ocean cliff gazeboo! The event coordinators/catering reps are a step up from party planners at Chuck-e-Cheese.  I was sadly disappointed.

One pelican would do a fly by over and over like he knew we were in awe of him.  Lots of swallows perched along the edge of the cliffs.  Watched fisherman fish off the rocks until the tide came in.

Wander30665,7,,2005-05-31,NONE,2005-06-06,4,A Best Buy,"My wife and I just completed a 10 day, 6 hotel driving tour of California and of all the places we stayed, this one stood out as the best buy for the money.

First, I must confess we got a very good rate of $111/night midweek with a AAA discount. The hotel itself is of unremarkable Best Western quality. The room was large and clean but rather plain.

What makes this property work is the location. When you think of the California coast this is it: waves crashing on cliffs below with sea gulls chattering about. We had an oceanfront room and the view was spectacular.

There is a gazebo right at the edge of the cliff where you can more closely observe the sea below. We were entertained by two sea otters playing at length below.

The pool was closed for repairs while we were there but it was too cool to swim anyway. The hotel has an arrangement with an adjacent restaurant to serve a free continental breakfast in the mornings. The view from the glass walls of the restaurant is also outstanding. The breakfast fare was nice as well. The dinner menu seemed to be quite pricey so we looked or other alternatives that evening.

We were late in arriving there and it was 8:30 by the time we started looking into eating dinner. First we tried McClintocks which is a western steak place across the highway. They told us there would be a 20 minute wait despite the dining room having several empty tables. 

Thinking it ridiculous to wait 20 minutes at that hour we made our way into town and ate at Giuseppi's which was crowded but they had immediate seating. The food was good.

SoCalMarc,9,"San Jose, California",2005-05-31,NONE,2005-05-22,4,Very good experience,"My girlfriend and I wanted to meet halfway (she's in LA and I'm in the Bay Area) for a romantic weekend in Pismo. The Shore Cliff certainly fit the bill. As the nomer suggests, the hotel sits on a cliff with fantastic views of the ocean and coast. There are several hotels on either side of the Shore Cliff and I couldn't tell you who or why one would have a better view over the other. The panaroma being equal, we had a spacious, clean room that overlooked the pool and then the ocean. The pool and spa were nice and we spent a good handful of hours lounging around in the water. Both of us being tennis players, we looked forward to checking out the clay courts the hotel boast on its website. Unfortunately, we were informed that the hotel does not as of yet own the two clay courts adjacent to the hotel. Luckily for us a quick three miles up the coast were two hardcourts next to two basketball courts that had great views of the ocean. We ate at several Pismo favorites including F McClintock's, Giuseppe's and the Splash Cafe and we were pleased with all three. The hotel itself has close ties to a clifftop restaurant just next door where you are given free coupons for your standard Continental brekfast every morning. The hotel staff was cordial but could have demonstrated a bit more of a welcoming attitude. Overall we had a very good experience at the hotel and for about 150 a night it is well worth at least one try.

Sozelle,14,"Broxbourne, United Kingdom",,,2005-01-04,5,Fantastic hotel,"Stayed there in July 2004. Arrived after a 6 hour drive down the Pacific Coast Highway from SF. Absolutely loved our one night stay. It was the most tranquil and beautiful place I have ever stayed in and EXACTLY how I imagined the Pacifc Ocean coast to be. Absolutely awsome views, we watched the sun set and the pelicans going about their business on the cliff for ages. Paid something like $140 for our large room which was perfectly comfortable. Did not use any of the hotel facilities but had a nice breakfast the following morning. I'd definitely recommend this hotel.

jgytraveler,38,"Sacramento, California",2004-09-30,NONE,2004-09-28,5,Breathtaking views,"We stayed at the Best Western Shore Cliff Lodge for one night, an amazing night. All of the rooms at the hotel, including the lobby, have perfect views of the Pacific Ocean. Our room was $116, a steal for everything we got. Upon entering our room, we were amazed at the furnishings and attention to detail - granite countertops, frosted glass doors, and wood furniture. Everything was what we would not have expected. The ocean view was amazing, especially during sunset. The hotel grounds have a romantic gazebo on the edge of a cliff, overlooking the ocean. Pelicans make their home on the bluff next to the hotel. I highly recommend this hotel. It was a truly amazing stay that I won't forget.

dkroberson,39,,2004-08-31,NONE,2004-09-06,4,Just Wonderful,"Stayed in a 2 bedroom suite and just loved it.
So large and easy to get around. Had 2 patio decks to enjoy and right on the cliff with the pacific ocean right below us. Had a beautiful view of the ocean and the grounds of the hotel.  The pelicans and other seabirds are plentiful to watch, however the smell walking out to the gazibo area is a little strong. The desk clerk could have been a little more gracious, but I supposed he was just busy.
The carpet and drapery could use a little touch up but overall the Inn was very pleasant and I would not hesitate for a moment in staying there again.

oxnardlouise,1,,2004-08-31,NONE,2004-08-13,2,Motel 6 with a view,"Nice view and landscape.  Rooms and building in need of an upgrade.  Worn out paint, pulled up carpet, loads of contractors on site working (but not improving) the building.  Breakfast is similar to what kids get at school.  Cold waffles, bagles and muffins along with juice or milk.  Anyone can walk off the street and help themselves to the breakfast.  There is no on checking for breakfast tickets.  Room was OK at best, we were pretty disappointed having paid the AAA $170 rate.  Have had much better rooms for $49 in Vegas.  Good place to stay if you can get the room for under $90, but for close to $200 it's a complete rip off.  
I just can't understand the prior reviews that gave 5 out of 5 ratings.  Could they be Best Western employees planting positive reviews?  You can get a lot more for your money elsewhere in Pismo or Morro Bay.  If you trust in the 5 star reviews you will definately be very disappointed.  Check around, the best places currently have no vacancies.  This place often has plenty of vacancies.  Book a place that you know first hand is a decent place.  You can't go by strangers' reviews, mine or any of the others.
BTW, there's plenty to do in the area.  Morro Bay, Cambria and San Simion are within 10-40 miles.  Wine tasting can be done in several of the surrounding areas.  The fun town of Cambria, Hearst Castle, Nitt Witt Ridge, and the little town of Harmony are great places to see.  You just have to get up and drive a little to find things to do.
I can't recommend it and would not stay again for over $50.

Jet31940,1,,,,2004-08-11,2,"Great view, average rooms","Well, things haven't changed in the past year according the previous 2 reviews.  Still some construction, painting, fixing doors, etc.  Still ripped up carpet in the outside halls.  Construction crews blocked 1/2 of the parking spots for most of the day.  They worked from 7AM-7PM and were in the way often, blocking entrances and stairways.  Although there has been and still is contraction going on, the place needs a complete overhaul.  Great view but very plain, average room.  
Paid $179 August 10-11 2004.  First room we were put in had the baseboards ripped off with spackle, drywall, and metal showing for the entire perimeter of the room 4-5 inches tall.  There was also a nasty, fresh ""smear"" of something on the wall that hadn't been cleaned and the sliding windows were extremely dirty.  Also, the AC did not blow any cold air in.  Was given a new room that was much cleaner and had baseboards.  Rooms are very plain and under decorated and under furnished.  
I guess you're really paying for the view, because it is amazing.  Views of the cliffs of Shell Beach all the way down to the end of the Pismo Dunes.  The grounds are also nice.  But you can visit the place to get the view and stay somewhere less expensive with better rooms.  Continental breakfast was what you'd expect, nothing special.  The restaurant was pretty good.  Didn't have a problem with the bird noise at all, maybe if you have your balcony door open.  Will stay somewhere else next time for sure.  The Spyglass Inn looks nice.

Merry P,4,"Simi Valley, California",,,2004-08-09,5,"Beautiful location, lots of pelicans to watch!","We have stayed here many times.  Beautiful ocean views from almost every room.  Nice pool and jacuzzi, continental breakfast included.  No beach access but there is a gazebo overlooking the ocean and many pelicans--very fun to watch!  People have weddings out here on the bluff also.  Will definitely stay here again.

TravelAdvice101,54,"Fremont, California",,,2004-07-29,5,Best hotel I've stay at in California!!!,"Wow. That's all I can say. AWESOME hotel. AWESOME view. I have not stayed at a better hotel in a better location this entire time of living in California. All rooms have a view...and they mean it. Ours was facing the Pacific Ocean on the 1st floor (it's a 2-story hotel). Waking up to the sunrise and hearing the waves at night...beautiful. We saw a wedding take place in the courtyard just facing our room w/the ocean in the background. It was sooooo nice. And the better part? We stayed on Memorial Day wknd...for $80!! Unbelievable!! I think hotels.com goofed because I never found this hotel for that low price since then. It runs about $200 any time of the year...but definitely recommended!! Would definitely stay at again! Perfect wedding spot for a small wedding as well!!

Denise T,3,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",,,2004-07-23,5,Fantastic! What a great location!!,"The hotel is in an excellent location and the rooms are amazing. Our room has two large double beds, a fridge and microwave as well as all of the normal things. The views from the hotel are out of this world and every room has a sea view it is a little taste of paradise. 

The swimming pool is great and there are plenty of sun beds round the side. The beach is just minutes away as well as some great shops including an outlet mall. Buffet style breakfast is also very nice and the views from the restaurant are also excellent.

We will definitely be going back to this hotel in the future!!!!

Adventurer25895,11,,,,2004-07-14,5,Wow!,"I booked a night at this fabulous hotel as a birthday treat for my wife while we were on holiday in California. 
The pictures I'd seen in brochures and on the BW web site made the hotel look like the setting for a romantic novel, perched on a cliff top with crashing waves down below. 
Well, in reality it was even better than that. When the guy checking us in saw that it was my wife's birthday, he upgraded us to a suite, which was incredible. We had two bedrooms (both with balconies facing out over the ocean), a bathroom, and a lounge/kitchen with balcony. 
We ate at the restaurant attached to the hotel and, although it was a little expensive, the food was outstanding. 
As we were travelling up the coast we were only there for one night...but we both wished we could have stayed for a couple of weeks. I have no doubt we will go back there in the future for a longer stay.

RKD419,32,,,,2004-06-22,4,"Beautiful, romantic and relaxing","This was a fantastic hotel.  We paid about $90 a night for this place and we only wished we could have stayed for longer.  I agree Pismo Beach hasn't got much to do but when you have the most beautiful, breathtaking scenes everywhere you look who needs to be entertained.  The room was very clean and comfortable with a fridge, microwave and TV.  The breakfast was more than enough in the restaurant that adjoins the hotel (Pelican Point).  In addition we ate in the restaurant and it was really good and great value too.  The pool is wonderful and looks out over the sea.  Probably one of the best all round hotels I've stayed in  and most definitiely has the best views.

Stay1052,1,,,,2004-06-18,1,What happened to customer service?,"My mom was taking my Dad to Pismo Beach for a special weekend.  I thought it would be nice to call ahead to the Shore Cliff and have a nice bottle of wine delivered to their room upon arrival.

I called the number to the hotel and Scott answered.  I said, “Hi Scott, my parents are checking into your hotel tonight and I was wondering if I could arrange for a bottle of wine to be sent to their room”?  Silence.  Scott finally said, “You will have to talk to the restaurant, let me connect you” and he was gone.  I was then promptly disconnected.  I called back, “Hi Scott, I was just talking to you about the wine and you were transferring me to the restaurant, I must have been disconnected”.  Scott replied in an irritated voice, “I can’t transfer you, you have to hang up and call the restaurant directly, here’s the number”.  “Thank you, Scott”, I said as he mumbled “Uh huh” and was gone again  

I then called the restaurant and said, “My parents are checking into your hotel tonight and I was wondering if I could arrange for a bottle of wine to be sent to their room”? Silence.  Finally, the woman said, “You will have to arrange that through the hotel”.  I said, “I just spoke with the hotel and they said to call the restaurant”.  She said, “Well, you will have to come into the restaurant and arrange this”.  I said, “I live 200 miles away”.  Silence.  She finally said, “Hold on” and again, I was disconnected.  

I’m sure much to everyone’s relief, I didn’t call back and they did not have to be burdened with what was obviously a special request.  If you decide to stay there, please don't ask for anything special.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,3
Tourist36351,2,,,,2004-06-15,5,Fantastic,"Stayed here June '04. Absolutely Superb! 

Incredibly romantic location with amazing sea views. Excellently finished, very spacious re-furbished rooms. Staff were really helpful and parking is free. A stop-off must on the Highway 1 drive. 

If I had to say anything negative, it would be that there's not much to do nearby, but frankly, you don't need to. I wish I could have stayed for longer...

Pathfinder24979,1,,,,2004-06-09,5,Room #114 Rocked!! The best yet!,"My best friend was married there at the Best Western Shore Cliff Lodge this last Saturday, June 6th 2004.  I must say that this hotel was the best hotel I have stayed in yet, in California. As much as I travel, having a pleasant room is important, but having a suite along the coast is just the best ever.  At night hearing those waves crash against the cliffs were amazing.  Our views were spectacular, and I will definitely be renting from you again in the future! I have also recommended Shore Cliff to several family and friends to check out.  Your staff was exceptional at getting us things we needed promptly, and the wedding was just perfect. I must say it was the perfect event for the perfect friend, and it couldn't have been any more beautiful than that!! Thanks so much Shore Cliff Lodge!! I hope to see you all again soon! In March, we'll rent a suite for my birthday and go up and enjoy the view! Best wishes!

BackPacker27843,1,,,,2003-12-29,2,Room with a view but thats all!!,"Room 225 had a great view, but that was it! We paid $127 for a regular size room on Dec 20th, the Hotel was rated as 3 starts by AAA in its current conditions I would only give it 1 1/2 stars. There is still contruction going. This place needs major renovation and updating. You can hear the ocean waves but you can also hear all the squaking birds living on the cliffs. They were loudest at 2 am in the morning. They were so loud I could hear them over the crashing waves! I would not reccomend this place at all, Try the Lighthouse, Sea Crest, Kon Tiki. I would only book this place again as a last resort. Don't get suckered in by the continetal breakfast. McDonals has better tasting food.",,,,,,,,,,,,4
Relax36472,1,,,,2003-07-25,3,Breathtaking views but under construction,"This hotel has some of the finest views of the Pacific in California. 
Our room, #319, was quite large but sparsely furnished. Beds were comfortable and everything was clean. Nice balcony. The hotel is getting a little dingy - worn carpeting, dinged paint. The biggest problem currently is there is a lot of construction going on. There were workers putting up a new pool fence ( working until 7 at night). 
There were three large cranes shoring up the cliffs and part of the property and parking was blocked by this. ( One night, we got back at 10:00 P.M. and there were only 3 parking spots left - far from our room. There is painting going on everywhere - along with wet paint signs. The Buffet Breakfast is poorly presented - more things than you need but not very appetizing. The juice machine is not nice - orange juice very thin and tasteless. Worth a visit but make sure they are through with their construction before you go. (Visited 23,24,25 July 2003)",,,,,,,,,,,,2
