A wonderful surprise for my girlfriend awaited our arrival.  The room was very functional and the staff ever present with hints and tips.  Location was also perfect.

TaraBB,44,,2021-10-31,NONE,2021-10-12,5,"The location, the staff, the vibe & the value","Perfect stay. Location easily walkable from BART station, to cable car, restaurants, shopping. The vibe and decor of the hotel is so unique and every day we found something new to look at. The rooms were immaculate, the beds and bedding so comfortable. The upscale bathroom had plenty of room, and the shower had good water pressure. The AC was cold and it ran without the cycling on/off some hotels use that can be noisy/disruptive. Our room on the 7th floor was very solid and so quiet (no traffic noise outside, no hallway noise, no noise from adjacent room- We did not even know there were guests in the room next to us until we saw them leaving one morning). The hotel is a really good value and it was a bonus to have the bar and the coffee shop on site. Absolutely everywhere we turned, staff members were gracious, friendly, and helpful-- not only to us, but to other guests no matter how big or small the questions. They never seemed impatient/rushed/bothered. Special thanks to Orion for helping us out one evening--stellar service is what makes guests return to properties and we will certainly be back.",,,5.0,,5.0,5.0,,McClinton Heil,General Manager,2021-10-13,Thank you TaraBB for your positive feedback!

Lauren C,6,"Los Angeles, California",2021-11-30,COUPLES,2021-11-24,5,OUR GO TO!!!,"We absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE Hotel Emblem SF. This is our second time staying here and this will be our go to every time we come to town. We live in LA and come here often to visit family- I feel so happy we have found this place! It truly makes our family trips a million times less stressful. 

Emblem took a beautiful old building and turned into into a chic hotel that feels luxurious, yet does not take itself seriously. Right when you walk in, the front desk staff is an absolute dream. Both times, we had the pleasure of checking in with Fungai- who remembered us from our last visit. He is such a joyful, kindhearted soul and the exact type of person that you want greeting you upon arrival of a place you’re about to call home for a few days. You can tell how much he loves his job and his attention to the guest is above and beyond. His leadership with his staff shines through and they have cultivated an incredibly warm culture. 

My FAVORITE part of the hotel is their unconventional amenities list- tarot cards? Yes. Bath bombs? Duh. A type writer for poetry? Of course! They’re all free to use and check out and elevate the sense of fun and experience. 

I cannot recommend this hotel anymore highly. The location is central and you’re going to have such a wonderful time in this special city. Love you, Emblem!!!!!

Lindsay P,1,,2021-11-30,NONE,2021-11-08,5,Wonderful Boutique Hotel!,"I've stayed at several boutique hotels in San Francisco and this by far was the best experience all around! Although the building is older, everything top to bottom has been thoughtfully designed and renovated. The lobby is beautiful to lounge in and the coffee shop adjacent was a huge plus. The rooms are smaller which is common in these types of hotels but very thoughtfully designed. We stayed on the second floor which was very convenient as there are stairs located right next to the elevator. 

Location is amazing but I will say my favorite part of the stay was the service. Mark at the front desk is an absolute rockstar! He set the relaxed and comfortable tone from the moment we arrived, he was incredibly thoughtful and helpful during our stay. I noticed the time and attention he took with all the guests and was really blown away by his genuine interest in ensuring we all had the best possible experience. So grateful we found this hotel!

After some exploring, we decided to come back before dinner and have a cocktail to unwind and relax before continuing on our journey. Audra made our drinks for us and asked questions about us. Where we’re we from, what were we doing, etc. She was so polite and welcoming! Where do they find this staff?? We need more people like them in this world. After having a lot of laughs, and a couple great tasting drinks we ventured off to our next destination. The next night we were greeted with Audra again.

Cindy W,662,"New York City, New York",2021-10-31,COUPLES,2021-10-16,4,Beautiful hotel...but not a lot more to offer,"We were super excited to stay at this beautiful hotel to celebrate our anniversary! Check-in was fast and friendly. But they did not know anything about the meter parking situation across the street. Turns out, you could park for free after 7 pm on Saturday, all the way until Monday. So that’s exactly what we did to save the $55 valet parking.

The front desk was about to charge us the amenity fee until I reminded her that the fee was waived for Expedia VIP. Good thing it was waived because we were hardly in the room…only came back to sleep for 6 hours as we were in town to visit friends. Furthermore, they ran out of the bath bombs and the coloring book (the only two things we wanted), so make sure you request for those as you check in.

Now comes the room, we asked for a room on a higher floor but the front desk told us the view is better for the one that was assigned (3rd floor), but we were pretty disappointed when we got in because there was absolutely no views at all. The room also felt really dark. But it was beautiful decorated and the bathroom was very comfortable.

We also were surprised that we didn’t get any special treat from the hotel for our anniversary celebration. The Chancellor hotel that we stayed at 2 days later gave us a bottle of champagne! 

Overall, it was a beautiful hotel and a convenient location to stay at. But for the price, you can probably get a better value elsewhere.",Park at the meters across the street on weekends,,,,,,,McClinton Heil,General Manager,2021-10-18,"Hi cindywZ7464ME, I am sorry the hotel did not live up to your expectations.

FloralAloha,31,,2021-09-30,NONE,2021-10-03,5,This hotel is seriously awesome,"If you’re thinking about booking here, do it!!!

I think the unique touches the hotel and staff offer make it a 5 star property and I really liked how it felt like a boutique experience, not a nameless, generic experience like you’d get at a bigger chain brand. 

I’ve stayed at the Omni, Four Seasons, Intercontinental, Hyatt, etc. and the service at the Emblem was better than most other places. The staff really do make you feel special and they have cool things to offer at the property that makes your stay unique like the city of San Francisco. 

Examples-
We borrowed bikes for free and got to take them on a spin around the city (make sure not to do a hilly path bc they’re Huffy beach cruisers with no gears and back pedal brakes haha)
We got free bath bombs to use upon request.
They offered me a free upgrade for my birthday and the front desk offered me a book as a little gift. In fact, this hotel has curated books you can read in your room and take home for a small fee!
I asked if they had shuttle service and because it was so early and I didn’t plan ahead to call the night before, the front desk comped me an uber bc she didn’t know the answer if the service was available which was so far above and beyond my expectations that I’ll never forget that gesture!

The decor is really neat, with the quotes and art and all of their stylish touches. It makes for great IG photo ops!

The shower is pretty amazing! They use nice bath products and the towels are luxurious. 

I loved the espresso maker in my room! 

The bed was super comfortable!

The location is great- very central to everything but just far enough off the beaten trail that there’s not a ton of crackheads floating around. The hotel felt safe coming and going at late/ early hours. 

The coffee shop is tasty though the craft drinks take a while to be made. 

Everything was really clean and nicely renovated. 

Overall, I highly recommend this place! A hotel hasn’t impressed me this much in a long time!",,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,McClinton Heil,General Manager,2021-10-04,Thank you FloralAloha for your positive feedback! The staff was very excited to see your review. We look forward to your return stay.,6

Great sustainability for guests with water refill stations on the floors.

One of the female staff members Gitanjali (had to ask spelling), greeted us in the mornings and assisted with checkout.

That being said, the rooms were quiet, comfortable, the service was incredible and it's a great location. The hotel is 1-2 blocks off of union square and a short walk to chinatown. When the Trolley is running (it was out of service when we were visiting) I imagine the location is even better. (There's a trolley stop 1 block from the hotel.)

There is also a coffee shop adjacent to the hotel that makes a KILLER cappuccino, I got addicted to them while we were there.

Tantalum129,75,"Chalfont, Pennsylvania",2021-09-30,NONE,2021-09-21,3,Interesting Hotel,"Pros:
Great desk staff and small lobby bar area is very attractive.  Check in and check out were quick and seamless with no surprises.  I did not visit the bar, but it seemed very nice.  

Cons:  There really isn't ""valet parking"".  It is available, but is at a neighboring hotel a two block walk away.  Additionally, there is no guarantee that you will be able to stop near the hotel to unload your bags.  This makes the hotel best for walkers or Uber users.  

The Takeaway:  I enjoyed my stay, but am unlikely to visit again.  I found the hotel to be a bit of a bear for parking, and its charm not enough to overcome this deficit.","There is only one elevator, so a lower floor room gives you the choice of the stairs.",,5.0,,5.0,3.0,,McClinton Heil,General Manager,2021-09-23,"Thank you Tantalum129 for your review.

We were a group of 10 family members in SF from various states for a long weekend.  We were sad that the delightful bar was not open, but the staff allowed for us to use a private room so we could all gather while still being in line with the City Covid protocols.

The rooms were nice, large, extremely clean and well decorated.   I will note that the walls are very thin and if you end up with a neighbor that chooses to party in their room, you may have issues.   This cannot be controlled by the lovely staff, of which we had wonderful after wonderful interactions with as we can and went during our stay.

kai_Lu825,1,,2021-08-31,NONE,2021-09-11,4,Lovely place to stay,"I'll get the bad out of the way: there were no trash cans. Recycling bins with no bags, but nowhere to put trash other than taking it downstairs to the desk. That was weird. The air conditioner worked pretty well but made some strange and loud rattling/clicking sounds even when it was off. The sheets weren't as soft as I would have liked.

The good: the location was close enough that I could walk to Market, Powell Station, restaurants, etc but just ""off the beaten path"" enough that it was quieter than I expected. The staff was thoroughly pleasant to interact with - friendly, helpful, but not intrusive or ""too much"". I ordered delivery a couple of times while there and they would take it from the driver and bring it to me, which made me feel safer.

The room itself was clean, comfortable, and exactly as I'd expected from photos and I loved the vibe of the decor. I appreciated the blackout shade on the window as well as the fact that I could actually open the window. Casting from my phone to the tv was easy to set up and the wifi worked perfectly. The provided toiletries smelled really nice.

Process was seamless, check-in was a breeze, and the room was reasonably priced and creatively designed. Due to Covid-19, the hotel bar was closed and public transportation wasn't running like usual but it didn't change the overall experience for us at all. We had a top floor corner room. The only downside was the bathroom door didn't close all the way so it got stuck when we came back in the evening. We had to go back to the lobby for assistance but it was fixed quickly. In the morning, we were able to step out on the fire escape and look around/take pictures. There are also some photo ops downstairs in the lobby area. Overall, would recommend if you're looking for a creative space to rest and get a good night's sleep in an old SF building.

There’s also a nespresso machine though it was in an odd location in the closet. The check in staff was friendly and attentive. We booked the room via the hotel website directly and it also came with a bottle of sparkling wine which was a nice touch.

My only disappointments were that no one explained that we would need to make special request for room service such as clean towels as we stayed 2 nights. Also there’s only one ancient elevator that also took forever to arrive so I found myself walking up and down the 4 floor steps than I liked

The property has a cool, hip vibe that we really enjoyed.  Definitely not cookie cutter!  We got a nice large room with a comfortable bed (the pillows were even fantastic).  The hotel is situated in  Union Square district with many upscale shops and restaurants.  There is also a walgreens drug store close by to purchase any forgotten items/snacks/etc.  

I always enjoy staying in a “boutique” hotel over the major chains, mainly because  they are more personal and accommodating.  Hotel Emblem did not disappoint.",,,,,,,,Milton Concepcion,General Manager,2021-07-28,Thank you Pioneer15328092205 for your review! Orion is a true gem at the property.

Your staff, led by Milton, anticipated all of our needs and went out of their way to make my son's 21st birthday special and memorable. Milton provided iced champagne before we even opened our door and then literally shipped our memories home. I cannot express in words what that meant to me.

Mary C,11,,2021-07-31,COUPLES,2021-07-18,3,Beautiful BUT…Could Have Been Better,It is a beautiful hotel. Unfortunately we did not have an opportunity to enjoy their bar area or coffee shop since they were still shutdown for COVID. They did offer drinks to be delivered to your room for a fee and of course a certain percentage for gratuity. The other reason we did not get to enjoy their lobby area was due to the extremely strong cologne smell in the lobby. It was so overwhelming that I would immediately have to walk outside or I would get sick to my stomach. The gentleman at the front desk was very nice to help us with our luggage and we appreciated that. I did tell him that we were on this trip celebrating our 25th anniversary hoping to get a nice view or a complimentary drink. The result was a view of two depilated buildings and no complimentary drink. The room was beautiful and the bed was very comfortable. There is no drawers so you either hang everything up or live out of your suitcase. We did ask for recommendations for dinner and he really did not help us much. So we ventured out on our own and all restaurants within a 3 block radius were closed or you could only do takeout by ordering over the phone.  Our taxi cab driver from the airport gave us more information and recommendations and warned us to not go past 4 blocks in a certain direction from our hotel or we would end up in the Tenderloin district. We finally found a very small bar and had drinks there.  I really wish we could have enjoyed the hotel.,When you walk out of the hotel if you turn to the right - if you walk past 3 blocks you will start seeing some people from the Tenderloin.,,,,,,,Milton Concepcion,General Manager,2021-07-23,"Thank you Mary C for your review!

Anne Marie,21,"Buena Park, California",2021-06-30,NONE,2021-07-12,5,Above and Beyond!,"My boyfriend and I came a few days before Covid rules were lifted so we didn't get to enjoy the beautiful downstairs bar and restaurant. What makes a hotel great though is the service and friendliness of the staff. In this way Hotel Emblem went above and beyond! They were very accommodating in so many ways from promptly bringing up a refrigerator for us, servicing our room at the last minute (because I forgot to call ahead of time) and other requests as well(towels, coffee pods etc). Among the other things you could request were an oil diffuser, a record player and a typewriter. If you wanted to type a postcard at the little desk in your room they'll mail it for you. This really added to the unique theme of the hotel.

  I loved the quotes from the different Beat writers everywhere, even on the carpet and ceiling! They did a great job displaying artwork, books and writings to give you that Beat feel. The bedding and linens were very nice and comfy. The bathroom was very nice as well with great lighting. I also loved the vintage elevator.  It's true that there's not much room for your clothes in the room, so I used the ironing board to lay out mine on. With it in front of the window overlooking  the city I felt very Beat poet! The location was great too as it was close to many locations we wanted to see. 

 I was there with my boyfriend for my birthday and they sent up a complimentary bottle of wine, which we appreciated and thought was very nice. Little did I know that my boyfriend had also planned to propose to me on this trip! He did so at Epic Steak on the outside patio overlooking the Bay Bridge which was all lit up. It was very romantic(and I said YES!). When the front desk heard about it when we got back, they sent up ANOTHER complimentary bottle of sparkling wine to celebrate! That really put them over the top in my book! Thank you so much to the staff in making our time there so special and enjoyable! We had a fabulous time and would definitely stay there again!",,5.0,5.0,,,,5.0,Milton Concepcion,General Manager,2021-07-14,Thank you annemarieoleary for your review!

The uniqueness of each room paired with the amenities (including a Nespresso machine, plush towels and options for record player/typewriter/coloring books) made for a fun stay! Definite beatnik vibes. We felt very swanky. Definitely recommend…just be prepared for a strong cologne smell as you enter, it’s the fragrance they’ve chosen for the lobby. But you definitely want to spend some time there to take in the beautiful book wall and photo opp! 🤩 

ALSO, they take COVID very seriously (staff wore masks and certain amenities like the lounge are closed right now.) Speaking of the staff, they were all friendly and went above and beyond throughout our stay.

He helped us get our giant bags out of our monster of a rental car in the middle of Sutter Street- treated us like we were important - gave great recommendations- and was just an overall delight. The room was large and inviting with fun amenities, and though the restaurant and coffee shop have not reopened due to covid- they were so helpful and gracious it didn’t matter. This was the ultimate big city cool boutique hotel experience, and we would stay here again in a heartbeat.

Organizing and planning a retreat took a lot of coordination and communication. Kylie made it easy and seamless before our team arrival; provide us with recommendations on what to do for team building activities and places to eat. Brad greeted me in person with other Hotel Emblem staff when I checked in at the front desk. 

Fungai provided exceptional service by preparing the boardroom with water, note pads, and pencils.  During the meeting he tried to troubleshoot the best he can when the draft conference room TV didn't connect to my Macbook Air (due to apple device compatible issues) or staff PC for a PowerPoint presentation - the picture on the display screen would go in and out. The team at Hotel Emblem SF (Gitanjali, David) was all super friendly and helpful, very accommodating to our request for early check-in and late check-out addressed any issues we had immediately the best they can and was transparent about the problem. Due to covid restrictions, the bar and restaurant at the hotel were closed but the location was a short walking distance to Union Square.

Despite unforeseen circumstances with Westin Hotel Valet offsite parking with the company rental car, the team was able to bond over Karaoke and Biking across the Golden Gate Bridge.

Filipendulous,425,"Louisville, Kentucky",2021-05-31,NONE,2021-05-20,3,Unique Boutique Hotel But Could Use Some Attention,"First, I want to say do not let my review deter you from staying here. However, as a road warrior, I am a hotel snob and I cannot fairly give a hotel four or five stars without everything being right. 

First the positives. I love the historic, boutique vibe with the unique book wall, amenities like record players, typewriters, and infusion oil machines for the rooms. The service, after a rough first impression, was personalized, warm, comfortable, and accommodating.  The price was more than fair for the area and the location is excellent. 

What could use improvement is listed here, to help you with your decision and/or stay:
1. Parking. The parking is a few blocks away at the Westin Garage. Upon checkin, we were handed a google map with the incorrect address. After a second drive around the blocks (you know how long that can take in SF), I guessed it might be the Westin and pulled in. I was denied. I pulled out and called the hotel to be told, ""yes, it is the Westin...we guessed on the address for the google map."" Okay, brilliant - just tell guests you have a deal with the Westin - why would you ever guess an address? The walk is uphill from the garage to the hotel - plan 7-8 minutes for a fair walker. 
2. My room was not pristine clean. Surface cleaning was great - deep cleaning was poor. The carpet, the corners, around furniture, around electrical cords is all starting to get that dusty buildup. I actually moved a piece of furniture to cover ugly electric cords and the dust bunnies covering them so I did not have to look at it.
3. The elevator is SLOW and small. Wait time is sometimes very long, and with Covid and not getting in the small elevator with other parties, unbearable. I understand - historic building, likely the original elevator. Just plan for it or take a lower level room and take the stairs. 
4. Amenities - if you offer, make sure you have enough. We ordered the diffusers and only one was available.   

I want to recognize the guy that works the night shift on the front desk. He is excellent.",,,4.0,,5.0,3.0,,Brad Busby,General Manager,2021-06-03,Thank you Filipendulous for your review.

Whenever we have come up to the city during this pandemic, we check either Hotels Tonight or Hotels.com to see which 4 and 5 star hotels have the best rate. We read the reviews for this hotel in TripAdvisor and decided to stay here. Our rate was 130 USD, a great deal, considering its great location just down the street from Union Square. Parking was an extra 30 USD, unheard of in any other time but the pandemic. Normally this hotel would have been 300 USD plus with parking of 60 USD. THANK YOU PANDEMIC!!!!
We were greeted by the nicest man  at the front desk. I wish I could have remembered his name, but he was super friendly and an amazing host. Throughout the weekend we didn’t see another person in our hotel. The bar and restaurant were closed, but I could only imagine what a great vibe it would have been if they were open pre-COVID. The lobby and the bar area were absolutely beautiful with all kinds of really quirky art pieces on the walls. The bookcase in the lobby was so cool. 
Our room was really nice and extremely clean. The bed was very comfortable and the art on the walls was super hip. The bathroom was amazing with a great shower and really nice toiletries. 
The location is really great. It is close to Union Square and Nob Hill. Most things around the hotel were boarded up, really depressing. Thank you pandemic and the government of SF. A few stores and restaurants were open, but not much. The only really happening places in the city were the Marina, North Beach, and the Ferry Building.

I arrived much earlier than the stated check-in time, and Gitanjali was quite accommodating and managed to get me into a room to sleep after my super early flight into SF. 

There were hand sanitizer stations pretty much around every corner of the lobby and the rest of the hotel. It was also great to see a housekeeper cleaning as I walked into the lobby. Everything definitely felt super clean. The sanitation kit in the room was also a plus--mask, contactless keychain tool, and pocket/credit card-sized sanitizing spray. 

The bed was comfy, and I had what felt like a ton of pillows. I also had a desk in my room and a large tv. I didn't have a mini-fridge to stock with food to minimize trips to the store, but a simple call down to the front desk resolved that issue. Orien set up a portable mini-fridge in my room (for eggs, in this trying time--that's an Always Sunny reference for all you cool cats and kittens).

The lobby looks super hip, and I can't wait until we get to our new ""normal"" to visit that bar and lounge that wasn't in-use during my stay. I didn't interact with many staff members, but the few I did were very friendly; Gitanjali, Orien, and Brad.

I’ve had the pleasure of staying at their sister hotel, The Viceroy in Santa Monica, which was also a fab experience. Hotel Emblem is a gem in Lower Nob Hill. The entry decor is clever, clubby & inviting. The rooms are thoughtfully appointed. The staff is gracious and hospitable. I will def be returning again (and again). Super convenient location to Union Square, Financial District, Chinatown. Rooms are quiet. Modern amenities include Elkay’s hallway hydration station for refilling water bottles. Impressed with eco-conscious touches like shampoo, liquid hand soap, etc. that get refilled instead of wasteful mini plastic bottles.

George,2,"San Francisco, California",2020-10-31,NONE,2020-11-06,5,Midweek SF during Shelter-in-Place (SiP),"I needed to stay overnight near Union Square during a trip to San Francisco. Luckily, I am a big fan of the Viceroy group so Hotel Emblem was on my list to check for availability.
It was a last-minute trip and it was actually fairly late in the day. My phone was dying so I didn't book online - instead I made the booking over the phone. The reservation was easy to make and they were very professional and thoughtful. 
When I arrive, Eduardo, Head of Operations, greeted me with a big smile and told me about the property. He offered me a choice of cocktail options (always take the Margarita!). They upgraded me and told me of the SiP protocols for the hotel and the city, in general. It was also very nice to find waiting in my room a COVID-prep package which included a Hotel Emblem-branded face covering, hand sanitizer, and a device to hotel doors without making physical contact.  The pillows were perfect which is very important because I often have neck muscles issues with low quality pillows. The large bathroom was nice and the water pressure was very strong.
At checkout, I was lucky enough to meet Brad, the GM. Again, super helpful about activities in the area, outdoor restaurants, and offered another cocktail ( I checked out after lunch) to get the day off to a good start.

Mrs. Popper,5,,2020-10-31,COUPLES,2020-10-18,5,Delayed Anniversary Weekend,"My hubby and I made reservations for March of this year and were really looking forward to our stay but then covid hit so we kept out credit on file. Then yesterday, we decided to pop into the city for an impromptu stay. I called the hotel and spoke to a very helpful employee who found our credit and booked us a room for that night. I explained how it was originally for our anniversary. A couple of hours later we checked in. Very easy to find. A different front desk employee (a gentleman) was super helpful on checkin and directing us to the shared parking garage. My hubby parked and I went up to the room. 
Cool and funky decor. Great, clean room. View wasn’t much but it wasn’t horrible either. Beautiful fixtures and marble in the bathroom. 
I needed ice and the front desk employee was quick and helpful since they needed to get it due to covid. Not everything was open in the hotel but it was still nice to stay and feel normal. Everyone wore masks and were respectful. A gift of a mask and hand sanitizer waited for us in the room. 
Since the restaurant was closed, we ordered take out and ate in the room. We requested plates and they brought them up quickly. 
Upon check out this morning I met the employee who helped me on the phone yesterday and she immediately knew who I was and asked how the Anniversary celebration was. She definitely impressed me. 
I would stay here again in a heartbeat. Highly recommend. Close to union square and great people watching. 
PS - loved the large bathroom towels!!!!",,,,,,,,Brad Busby,General Manager,2020-11-19,"Thank you TeamPopper for that great review, and Happy Anniversary!

Worldwide Travel,3688,"Bangkok, Thailand",2020-09-30,NONE,2020-10-11,5,Refreshing Boutique Hotel,"I had a quick stay in San Francisco and I booked at Hotel Emblem; it used to be called Hotel Rex and after extensive renovations it reopened last year under a new name.  It is clearly a boutique hotel which is a refreshing change in scenery from the large hotel chains.  While the hotel has some drawbacks which would make me hesitate for longer stays for example there is no proper breakfast, no gym, and no suites, however the room was interesting, the bar area attractive, and the price tag was reasonable so I can recommend it.  

We arrived at the hotel at 9am and because hotel occupancy was quite low, our room was ready for early check-in.  The reception area is unique and right away guests can see the main design and theme of the hotel with the wall being made up of books stacked up all the way to the ceiling.  

I booked an Emblem King room and received a double upgrade as GHA Black to the Emblem Premium King.  This room type is a bit larger than other rooms but the hotel does not have suites and the cash rates don’t vary all that much between room types.  The room was in the corner at the end of the hallway so it did not have much foot traffic in the hallway; nevertheless it’s an older property (building 100+ years old) so soundproofing was not the best and we could hear some guests getting in and out of their room.  The design of the room was interesting and the bathroom remodeling was well done including a stand-alone shower rather than a shower in a bathtub.  While I always prefer to have a suite, for a corner room it was fairly spacious and had enough space that I did not think it was a major drawback.  

The welcome amenity was one of the better ones I have seen.  First off they brought an old style Remington typewriter to match the overall theme in the hotel and you can type a letter which the hotel will mail on behalf of guests.  Second they had a couple of craft beers along with Manhattan cocktail bottles, plus some snacks.  Considering that prices normally average 300 USD at this property and that they are currently less than half of that, they could have been excused for cutting back on the welcome amenity (in fact many hotels do exactly that nowadays) but this was generous given the room rate.  

As expected, free breakfast is not a benefit of GHA Black status unlike the big hotel chains, however one issue at this hotel is that you cannot even select a rate type that includes breakfast simply because there is no kitchen and dining room with a proper sit down breakfast.  There is a small coffee shop near reception with some seats but nothing else.  The main sitting area on the ground floor is the Obscenity Bar & Lounge which is used for happy hour and socializing.  In different circumstances it would be an inviting place to have a drink.  

I am not an expert of the hotel market in San Francisco so I do not have many reference points to compare to, but based on my brief stay I was pleased and I would return in the future if I am in the mood for something different.",,5.0,5.0,,5.0,,,Brad Busby,General Manager,2020-11-19,"Thank you WorldWideTravel88 for your fantastic review.

Definitely worth staying here if you wish to stay in this area, but that is the question - why would anyone wish to stay in this area?

And indeed it is a fine hotel, just again an undesirable  location.

Small gripe too - the bathroom is poorly thought out. No counter upon which to place clothes or other items beyond small toiletries, a tankless toilet (making for very loud flushes) and a dated tub with a window with a painted sash that still even has a pulley and rope system and otherwise looked tired and SRO-like.

Brittany Noelle,97,"Los Angeles, California",2020-02-29,SOLO,2020-02-18,4,Unique hotel within walking distance to the theater ,"The ambiance of the hotel is very unique and nice. I would really give this hotel a 4.5 if that was an option.  The only less than 5 star things for me were that the sheets weren’t very soft (would prefer a down comforter) and the fitness center isn’t inside of the hotel. They will give you a pass to the gym down the street which I didn’t realize until I was checking out. 

Check in: Check in was very easy. They allowed me to check in early at 11am and graciously kept my back until then (I arrived at 10am). They sent me a text to let me know that my room was ready which was super nice and convenient. 

The Room: The room was lovely. I stayed in the Emblem room with a queen bed. Inside of the wardrobe closet, there’s a Nespresso machine to make yourself coffee during your stay. Very nice touch. I love the decorations (great for content creation if you’re an influencer). I also love that they gave you Roil products to use in the bathroom. These products are sulfate and paraben free which I appreciate as a wellness and clean beauty advocate. Additionally, there’s a black makeup towel which is super unique and a beautiful vanity with natural light (perfect for applying makeup). To make the shower work, pull down on the circular nob at the bottom of the tub spout. 

The Location: the location is perfect if you plan to walk to the theater district. I came to San Fran to see Harry Potter and the Cursed Child at the Curran theater and it was a 4min walk from the hotel. The hotel is also next to some great restaurants and bars. It’s also very safe if you’re a woman traveling solo. There were plenty of other people walking around during the day and night. I also felt secure inside of the hotel.

The Amenities:
On each floor there is a filtered water dispenser and a fridge with individual packages of ice so that you can stay hydrated and mix cocktails in your room 😉. Although, there is a lovely cocktail bar and sitting area down stairs. They have lots of books and a little trolly that they will bring to your room and that you can swap books with if you enjoy reading. There’s also a cute little corner nook by the coffee shop to do some reading. Another room in downstairs has a pool table in it. Again, there are tons of places to create content if you’re an influencer or blogger. I wish the fitness center was inside of the hotel though. You have to walk down the street to a gym that Hotel Emblem gives you access to (which I found out at check out 😩) There’s a coffee shop attached to the hotel that was ok. I think I caught them at a super busy time Sunday morning because it took almost 20min to get my food( they were also out of poached eggs). The cappuccino was a Starbucks level, nothing special or crafted.My goat cheese and prosciutto toast had way too much goat cheese (and I love cheese). I also wished they served their food and drinks in glass instead of in paper cups and to go packages. 

Overall the hotel was amazing and I would
certainly stay there again without hesitation. ",,,,,,,,bbusby1,General Manager,2020-03-05,"Thank you brittanynoelle for your detailed review.

The cons:  noise, noise, noise, noise... from the adjacent rooms - mostly the toilets flushing and doors slamming.  The HVAC unit doesn't run in 'fan only' mode - so you either get AC or heat - and when the target temp is reached, the fan shuts off - not good for those of us who like to run a fan all night.  Note:  upon leaving, I noticed a sign in the room saying white noise generators could be borrowed from the front desk - I wish I had seen that sign earlier.
The adjacent breakfast nook restaurant was great - fantastic menu items and great prices.

My room was very comfortable and clean with the largest TV I've ever had in a hotel. I didn't have a great view, I looked out to what appeared to be the back of the building, but I checked in early and agreed to take whatever room they had with a king bed so you get what you get. I kept the shade down and all was fine. We hosted a meeting there and Myqel who was our conference host was super pleasant to work with an took great care of my group.  There is a coffee shop on site that had the best avocado toast I've ever had in my life and although I did not eat at the hotel restaurant, the food they catered for our conference was very tasty.  There was always someone cleaning and making sure the hotel was spotless, I was impressed.

The Viceroy chain remodelled it as the Emblem.  One might say ""Every expense has been spared.""  The color scheme, once in rich reds and yellows is now a boring black/gray/white.  Edgy?  No, cheap.  The room lamps were once large china lamps with interesting shades with good art on them...now they're rock-bottom generic.  The rooms used to have plush leather armchairs and couches...now you get a stiff tiny pew against the wall and a college-dorm-type chair.  No armchair.

gbdigital,1,"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",2020-02-29,FAMILY,2020-02-09,2,Walls Are Paper Thin,"First off, the hotel itself is very nice, clean, and modern. But my wife and I had a really poor experience. I had gotten a medical procedure done the day before and we were flying back to the east coast the next day. So we decided to stay in San Fran one night on 2/7 in room 608, hoping to get a good night of sleep. 

At around 3:30am we were awoken by the shower running and at first, thought ours turned on somehow. But it was actually the shower next door. Fine, I get that sometimes you can hear water rushing through the pipes. But then we heard people talking loudly. At first we thought they must have been standing right outside our door, but then realized it was coming from the room next to us. And then we realized they weren't talking loudly at all, but having normal conversation and we were able to hear every bit it as though they were standing in our room. This also meant that earlier in the day, the guests next door could probably overhear private conversations between me and my wife. Then came the music blasting. 

We called down to the front desk to complain. 20-30 minutes go by and the music was still playing loudly. We called down again and the front desk attendent let us know that she had texted them, but would now call them. I was already annoyed at the situation but the fact that she only sent a text instead of calling the first time annoyed me even more. We could hear their phone ring and in my half sleep, I actually picked up our phone because I thought it was our ringing. We could hear everything (and I mean everything) and their alarm clocks as well, which woke us up again as I thought they were our own. Every sound they made, everytime they spoke, sounded as though it were happening right in our room. 

Upon checkout there was a new front desk attendent and we let him know of our poor experience. He asked if there was anything he could do but we were flying back east that morning. He said the hotel would follow up via email to ""help make it right. "" As of writing this review, we have still not heard anything from them. 

I can't say for certain that all rooms are like this. My parents did not have a bad experience. It appeared as though our room had one of those connecting doors to the room next to us. I've been in other hotels where this is the case, but I've never stayed in a hotel where it sounded like other guests were staying in our room too, where another guest's alarm clock could wake me up. Should we ever find ourselves in San Fran again, we 100% will not stay at this hotel again. Plenty of others around (including a Marriott right down the street) to chance another bad experience.",,,,,,,,bbusby1,General Manager,2020-03-05,Thank you gbdigital for your review.

I chose the front room and though it is bright and gorgeous, it gets too bright in the morning with the sunrise, and the black out blinds are no match to the sun.
It is also noisier, but that's acceptable - I was warned about it.
The doors of the hotel rooms, however are a different story, despite the mechanism in place, doors can still be heard slamming late at night, down the hall. And constant door banging sound somewhere.
Front desk clerk during check in was great.

I'd rate the gym (it was excellent) but the closest one is closing in Jan 2020, so not sure what's next. A slight speck on the overall experience here was that I didn't know, neither from my reservation nor during checkin (my card was only authorized the regular $100 for incidentals), that I'm gonna owe over $60 extra per day for taxes and amenity fees - it's fine, most hotels do that, but would be nice to know upfront.

Lobby is small but very chic, with a cafe attached (we did not eat or drink in either location).  The rooms are pretty small but it is right in downtown so they make it work.  The bathroom is also small for the same reason.  There was an urban amenity fee of $29 that was charged upon checkout that we should have asked about because I have no idea what that would be for.  Unlike a resort fee where you get a spa to use as a result or a pool or something, I'm not sure what the charge gave us other than a $30 more expensive night (and parking was already $35).  

The room itself was comfortable and clean though.

Yes it’s a trendy hotel, but the service is great, and the rooms are quirkily decorated, but lose none of their comfort. 

Some nice touches like a water fountain on every floor you can fill your bottle up from, and cookies every evening, and decent toiletries too.

I’d stay again, ask for a room at the back if you want quiet and aren’t bothered about a view

Emblem is perfectly located near Union Square to make that the reason alone to stay there.  However the staff - from checking in with a hot scented hand towel to bar staff really made it an exceptional experience. Special mention must be given to Nora the bartender in the very comfortable and friendly “Obscenity” bar on the street level of this Beat Generation themed hotel and bar.  Nora invented custom cocktails that included burnt sage, seared peppers and more.

Matt M,251,"Somerville, New Jersey",2019-12-31,NONE,2019-12-26,4,Wanted to love it but...,"This is a tough review to write because I really wanted to love The Emblem and feel that if I am in town again I'd give it another shot based on the parts I DID love about it. However, several items fell short on this visit.

Check-in was fantastic (approximately 5:00pm) with a wonderful front desk staff person. Unlike many others have posted, I did not receive a voucher for a drink at the bar. Not really a problem since it was never promised but I did see others using them at the bar later that evening. I paid full price through the official booking site.

The old hotel has really been transformed and it's like a super chic modern boutique hotel wrapped around San Francisco's beatnik history. The little touches are superb - eco-friendly water bottle fillers on each floor with fresh cut fruit for infusion, fruit / cookies out on each floor for snacks, and access to unique items like a typewriter.

Unfortunately my room had some issues with cleanliness. First, a glass set for me to use for water was covered in lipstick. Then, I found hair throughout the shower.

After exploring the city a bit, I came back for a late dinner and drink at the hotel's bar/restaurant. Since it was a holiday, the posted time was 7-10pm. I arrived at 9:30pm and the bartender informed me that she would be serving only beer and wine (turned out not to be true) and that last call would be in 15 minutes. No problem. I ordered a local craft beer and a chicken sandwich. The place was really busy and it was evident the bartender and bar back were in some kind of conflict with the chef. Clearly understaffed, service was very slow but she continued serving until past 10pm. My food didn't arrive for about 30 minutes and was mediocre at best. For $18, this was a shame. I ended up taking my food to go (which was a problem in and of itself) and ate in my room. This was particularly frustrating because I emailed the hotel 3 weeks ahead of time to inquire about dinner options without getting any response.

It's hard to separate the restaurant experience from the rest of the hotel but this was a pretty big downer.",,5.0,4.0,,,,2.0,bbusby1,General Manager,2020-01-22,"Thank you Matt M for your review, and feedback.

Jules T,1311,"San Jose, California",2019-12-31,NONE,2019-12-09,5,Amazing weekend,"Booked this hotel through Hotwire like 6 months ago so was ""assigned"" to us ... never quite know what 4* hotel you'll get ... but wow we were so very happy with Hotel Emblem on our recent visit to the city. 

The location is superb! Right off Powell street and easy walk to everything Union Square. We were in town celebrating birthday ... so saw Hamilton, had dinner at a French cafe and all within easy walking distance of the hotel. 

This is a very old hotel recently renovated. It's very upbeat and modern but yet the lounge is super cozy and warm. The decor/colors in the rooms is fabulous. The front desk staff was fabulous 5* plus!  Awesome to have such pleasant service. 

The first room we had (king) was such a weird layout ... as it was hammering down rain we knew we'd want to come back after dinner and watch TV and the setup would not work so the desk kindly moved us to another king room ... luckily as they were at capacity that night. They even hand delivered a bath bomb as I mentioned I wanted a hot batch because we were cold and wet. Our view was of the roof next door but was of no matter as it made for a perfect quiet night!  As it was Santa-con we were overjoyed to have a quiet room! 

The bathroom was really small but very nicely redone. The plumbing has some kinks though but nothing to take away from the 5* rating. 

The cookies and fruit on each floor was nice touch although I'd suggest taking a cookie early as we did not and when we came back they were dead gone. Another nice touch was the lovely glassware in the room. Again, as it was such nasty weather we wanted to come back to room for a drink so nice to have proper glassware. 

Overall this hotel was SO nice that next time I'm in the city think I'll just book it outright and forget Hotwire. We know we'll have the perfect stay at Hotel Emblem.",King room on a high floor away from elevator would be best,,5.0,5.0,,5.0,,bbusby1,General Manager,2019-12-18,"Thank you Jules T for your great review!

mcraig,5,,2019-07-31,NONE,2019-12-03,4,Good hotel in a great location,"I stayed at Hotel Emblem for a few nights with my wife when visiting San Francisco. The hotel is in a great location; it's easy to walk or catch public transport from the hotel to many of the main areas and tourist spots of the city. It sits right next to Union Square. There are plenty of nice restaurants (visit Del Popolo Pizzeria but book in advance!) and bars within walking distance of the hotel. We felt very safe when walking around after dark, but cabs, including Uber, are easy to grab if walking isn't your thing. The hotel staff were generally pleasant and helpful, especially those on reception. The bar in the lobby is fine for a drink to kill time, but there are much better bars in the area. The hotel design is cool and it is clearly pitched as a 'design hotel', but it's not quite as luxury as it thinks. The bedroom was nice but pretty noisy. The layout of the room was a bit odd and didn't really work too well, where a lot of space was lost due to a 'cool' wardrobe being plonked in the room at an odd place. Nevertheless, the rooms are nice and kept clean. Bathroom was nice too. The hotel provides free chilled water and ice on each floor. They also have fresh cookies, though they're like gold dust as people inevitably steal them all as soon as they're put out. In short, the hotel is good, in a great location, decent value, staff are pleasant, and I'd stay again.",,,4.0,3.0,4.0,,,bbusby1,General Manager,2019-12-18,"Thank you mcraigx for your review.

TDG65,43,Maryland,2019-11-30,BUSINESS,2019-11-30,2,"Great Start, Below Average Thereafter","I stayed at this property the second weekend of November for business. As usual, let's go Pros and Cons.

PROS
1. As soon as I arrived, the staff offered me a hot towel to wipe my face and hands and a lemonade, both of which made for a great first impression. 
2. The property is a short distance from Union Square. 

CONS
1. The property has only one elevator and it's small and slow.
2. I stayed on the fifth floor and the hallway had a smell that said ""dated property."" The smell in my room was even stronger. As I was traveling by myself for business, I probably could've made it work. However, if I was traveling with my family, I would've moved immediately. 
3. My view out of my window was a close up of the side of a dirty building.
4. I got maybe an hour of sleep because of the noise from the room above me. I called the front desk to inform the staff of the issue. The noise started again maybe 45 minutes later. 
5. The closet space is made for very small people or children. My suit jackets could not fit without folding from the bottom. 

OVERALL-I ended up leaving this property after my one night there. I would not stay here again. While the staff members were nice, the property had too many negatives that outweighed anything positive.",,2.0,4.0,,3.0,,,bbusby1,General Manager,2019-12-13,"Thank you TDG65 for your review, we really do appreciate your comments and feedback, and we're sorry to hear that we were not the right hotel for you.

His company offered us many nice choices for hotels, but we chose to stay at Emblem on our own dime.  Based on the reviews, I assumed we would love it.  We just didn't  My husband grew up in the Bay Area and thought it would be a great location for shopping, which we wanted to do while in town.  It was very close to Union Square and that part was great.   The restaurant serves very good coffee in the morning and the bar was nice.  The decor is beat era and very fun and interesting, although the entrance is very unwelcoming.  It's partially under construction? and leads to a dark elevator room and stairway - you have to walk around the corner to reach the lobby - a very uninviting arrival  The room was very cute and decorated in the same beat era style, although it was terribly dark and thus felt claustrophobic. There were numerous large stains all over the chair, that was off-putting.  The bed was truly one of the most uncomfortable (saggy and lumpy)  I've ever slept in and the pillows were terrible too, however, the  linens were nice quality and clean.  Our room was situated next to a sloppy looking water station.  This location was the worst part of our stay, as it's where people congregate and conduct conversations.  This was particularly annoying during the early and late night hours.  There was also a 1 inch + gap between the door and floor which made the problem worse - not only did the noise come through as if you were in the same room, the light came straight through too   Immediately upon arrival my husband went to dry his hands and the towel rack came out of the wall.  The sink is so poorly positioned/designed that it's virtually impossible to wash your face in it without banging your head on the shelf.

The hotel has a hip vibe, and is decorated throughout with literature references, much of it from the Beat Generation of authors and poets. While we got checked in, we were offered sangria and lemonade, which we took one floor up to our room. The staff at the front desk were friendly and helpful throughout our stay, and we had several opportunities to interact with them.

Our room, a double/double, was nicely furnished in accordance with the overall hotel theme, and we enjoyed the quirky bits, from the stack of modern books on the desk to the “Pot is Good” pillow on the couch. We had plenty of room for the three of us, although there was just the wardrobe with its hangers and high shelf for stashing clothes. Since we mostly live out our suitcases, it wasn’t a big deal.

 The bathroom was modern and well-equipped, filled with tile and glass and porcelain fittings. The toilet, when flushed, sounded like a jet engine, so we quickly learned to limit our usage and only flush when needed.

Room was ok size wise; the bed was really comfortable; once we got help from reception on how to get the water to come from the shower instead of the bath tap, showers were great. 
Was relatively quiet.
Nice to have a choice as to whether to have housekeeping clean the room or not. 
Service couldn’t be faulted, and nothing was too much trouble when we asked for help eg why the lights didn’t come on in the room.
Enjoyed having breakfast in Bluestone Lane  coffee shop most days.
Liked the filtered water, cookies each afternoon and USB plugs in the bedside tables to charge our phones. 

What could be improved :
1. No fridge in room; we were given a mini-fridge but it wasn’t even big enough to hold a bottle of beer so we returned it

The foyer area was being renovated - they had gone to some lengths to make sure that it didn't impact on our stay at all.

Everywhere you look from the foyer to the bar area there is something interesting to read or gaze at. Very hip. Our room although not large was also very comfortable and spotlessly clean. We also enjoyed the filtered water available in the hallway with fresh lemon and lime slices daily.  The staff were particularly friendly and it was lovely to get a thank you note from housekeeping when we left a daily tip.

Smixi,13,"Guilford, Connecticut",2019-10-31,NONE,2019-10-30,2,Needs a Good Cleaning,"The best part of the Hotel Emblem is the staff: very polite, friendly, and helpful. The second good thing is its proximity to the MOMA. The hotel, however, has a pretty wretched musty smell as if the carpet hadn't been cleaned for a hundred years. The breakfast cafe has inept staff: I asked for plain oatmeal i.e. without nuts and coconut, etc. and I received a cupful of dried oats, which would be amusing except I discovered this in my room and had to go back to the cafe to ask them to cook the oatmeal. Another morning, I asked my husband to bring me some tea with milk. He called to say they had only soy or almond. I said surely that's not right. He asked again, and lo and behold, some milk was found somewhere. Also, the hotel tries so hard to be witty and clever with its sayings on the wall and ""pot is fun"" pillows, but it just seems forced and not very original. The bathroom is a nice size but missing some basic toiletries, such as a shower cap and shampoo. Plenty of conditioner...A very noisy street below for those who like to open windows at night. Honestly, I couldn't wait to get out of the place. I think advertising the place as ""boutique"" is a stretch.

I think you will like it if you’re on the younger side or possibly traveling solo. The hotel is in a great location, a block from Union Square and close to all the transportation you need to get around San Francisco. The hotel itself has a great hipster style. The rooms are on the small side, at least too small for us.  No real place to sit together and hardly any place to put your stuff. The showerhead doesn’t allow you to aim it where you want,  but there is a hand-held. They had swell product. Extremely limited breakfast choice in the hotel, although there are other places close by. Often loud rock music in the entry and bar area. You could also hear noise from the hallway. The bed was comfortable and stylish. The staff were super nice, accommodating, and friendly. Good for the price range just not my style of hotel because of the trade-offs.",,,,,,,,bbusby1,General Manager,2019-10-10,"Thank you JOHOSeattle for your honest review.

Location was also great to everywhere that we wanted to go. 

Hotel is very new and very instagrammable. Room was a bit small but considering it was in SF. We had a corner room just infront of the elevator which could get a little noisy but it didn't really disturbed our sleep. However, the only thing for us was the wifi, it had some problems for our devices but the hotel said it was working.

Michael S,5,,2019-07-31,SOLO,2019-09-20,4,Very pleasant,"Optimal location close to Union Square.  The staff was pleasant and accommodating. The room was nice but not extraordinary.  My room had a large bathroom  and a decent sized sleeping area.  The window faced another wing of the hotel.  This imparts there is not much natural light.  But it allows for a quiet night sleep.  The windows can be opened to let in the cool SF air.  If you can imagine it was 59° at night in the middle of July.  Price was reasonable albeit the dreaded resort fee was tacked on.  But this allowed for use of a nearby athletic club with a pool.  So at least in this case the fee can be justified.  For food, close by is Mensho Tokyo which likely has the best ramen in the U.S. I have tried many but none come close.

The room was well decorated and the bed was super comfy therefore I always woke up rested for the work day ahead.  There were zero issues connecting to the Wi-Fi. The desk was a good size so I was able to stay productive.  During downtime, it was easy to step out and find things to do and see because the property is conveniently located in Union Square i.e. lots of shops and great restaurants within minutes walking distance.  There's also free water and snacks for guests on every floor.   The general vibe at the property was quirky and fun.

Astoria3,66,"Minneapolis, Minnesota",2019-08-31,NONE,2019-09-16,3,"Not bad, not great","This hotel experience was definitely more of a 3-3.5 for me. The front desk staff were very nice and friendly, the bathrooms were nice and modern, but there were a few major things that downgraded my experience that the staff just aren't able to fix. 

First and foremost was the street noise - and we weren't even facing the street. When we first arrived to our room we could perfectly hear conversations from people on the streets walking outside to the point where I asked my fiancé if the window was open. The windows of the hotel are so thin that it is almost like there is no glass at all - all the noise comes through that loudly. We were on the top floor and were woken up at least 3 times times between 12-5:30am each of our 3 nights by the mentally ill homeless folk that hang outside on the street and scream/yell profanities. Neither of us got much sleep and were pretty exhausted by the time we got home. We didn't alert the hotel staff because as we were already top floor and not street-facing, not sure what they could really do about it. 

Secondly, the area isn't that great and I wouldn't advise walking around without other people with you. The hotel is basically a block away from union square and that area is a huge hotspot for the homeless/mentally ill. The streets are dirty, often smell of urine and have a few angry mentally ill folk about. We got mcdonalds (literally a few shops down from the hotel) one morning and a large man made a scene hitting and knocking things over yelling/ranting before he stormed out. Nicer and much more safer looking neighborhoods we saw were in Pacific Heights and in the Marina District closer to the Palace of the Arts.

Third, while the hotel has a cool look to it, the floors are almost comically uneven. We both felt like we had vertigo walking around the room and made jokes about ""rolling down"" to the bathroom. This is a minor issue but nevertheless, I would rather stay in a place with more solid floors if given a choice.

Fourth, there is only one elevator, and it's an old-school small elevator that can only hold about 4 people max. There were periods of waiting 10 minutes for the elevator to finally arrive with a spot open for us to get in. 

My takeaway from our stay was that the noise and general unsafe vibe of the area mean that I'll probably look elsewhere for my next stay to San Francisco.",,3.0,5.0,,2.0,,,bbusby1,General Manager,2019-09-20,"Thank you Astoria3, we appreciate your honest feedback.

You just get a lot less for your money in San Fran so for £330/ night I’d usually expect a lot more from a hotel, but I think that pricing is normal for the location. 

The lighting is pretty dark in the room as there is no central light. Bed was very comfortable & the bathroom is spacious compared to the room. 

All in all a decent place to stay. ",,,,,,,,bbusby1,General Manager,2019-09-17,"Thank you jameshP3440QM for your review.

The negatives: The beds are not very comfortable and you just get one pillow (normally all hotels give you two). The walls are paper thin, you could hear everything. 
We asked one of the receptionist for a cool place to have cocktails and a bite to eat. She gave us two dreadful recommendations....not very cool, I will say old fashioned and very touristic.

Vendredimanche,387,"Chipping Campden, United Kingdom",2019-08-31,NONE,2019-08-27,5,"Fab location, quirky vibes","We spent 4 nights at the hotel Emblem in August 2019 as a family.  We really enjoyed our stay.

Pros:
- perfect location near Union Square (also very close to Loris' a really fab diner, and Sears another good diner). You can catch trams easily from near the hotel and all shops and amenities are on your doorstep. The hotel is walking distance from Chinatown 
- the staff at the front desk were lovely (we enjoyed the free cocktails offered to us one afternoon!) and knowledgeable (good recommendations of local restaurants) 
- we enjoyed the cookies, fresh fruits and iced water at the end of the corridor
- the beds were very comfortable with good quality linen and pillows 
- good shower pressure 
- the hotel's Beat Generation-themed decor is quirky and original - lovely registration desk / lobby/ bar area 
- the place felt clean (save for the smell which I mention below) 

Cons:
- there is a rather strong smell in the corridor - I expect it is the cleaning product but it is quite overpowering
- we were a family of 4 and had 2 queen beds in the same room - a rather tight squeeze!
- poor lighting in the room 
- poor noise insulation between rooms 
- only 1 lift which is very slow 
- limit of 3 or 4 devices per room on the WiFi (although the front desk can give you an additional code) 
- as we were travelling with kids, I wasn't keen on the name of the bar which is advertised in the lobby and rooms (""Obscenity"")

Galagliac,4,"Ripon, California",2019-07-31,FAMILY,2019-07-30,5,San Francisco Gem!,"We stayed at this lovely hotel for two nights to celebrate a birthday. Our room was very comfortable with a large walk-in shower and extremely comfortable bed.  The hotel is well positioned within the city and it was easy to get Uber’s, usually within less than five minutes.  The location also provides an easy walk to Union Square shopping. The hotel has a clever beatnik theme, and all the amenities are first rate.  When we had any questions about local spots, Chelsea at the front desk gave helpful suggestions and greeted us warmly every time we saw her.  The staff was very cool and helpful throughout our visit.  Even at checkout, we were treated like guests who might return multiple times, which was a welcomed attitude.  Virginia was another helpful front desk staff.

The attached bar and restaurant has a small but tasty menu and our drinks were fresh and excellent—thank you to our bartender Megan!

I’d recommend this fun hotel to anyone staying in San Francisco for any length of time.",,,,,,,,bbusby1,General Manager,2019-08-15,"Thank you Galagliac for your awesome review!

Sturgeon,67,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",2019-07-31,SOLO,2019-07-09,5,Great hotel and ideally located,"I stayed here for 5 nights, it was overall a great experience, I'd give it 4.5 rather than 5 if I could but felt marking it as 4 out of 5 was unfair.

The location was great, literally behind Union Square so a huge amount of world class shops moments away. It was walkable to most destinations, I had considered staying in other locations but I'd have to use more transport to get around, this was perfect and there was always ample space outside for an Uber to pull up. One word of warning is to be aware of the downsides of SF particularly near the hotel and the Tenderloin area (avoid!), a LOT of homelessness with the majority having addiction issues and these individuals can be intimidating, unpredictable and there can be some very unsavoury behaviour. I was shocked initially and wondered where the hell I had booked. Just have your wits about you and I do still think the location was the best choice I could have made.

The hotel has had a very recent refit, it's a smallish property with around 90 rooms, only one small lift. I had a room on the top floor at the back, it was far larger than expected, really quite big and quiet, I did pay more for a larger room though and noticed most others were small but comfortable when I saw them. Definitely some sound proofing issues from the corridor plus I had a connected room to a stranger and heard everything. I did spot a planning application for better glazed windows so that would be a improvement not that I had issues with street noise. The room itself had fantastic amenities that I'd researched beforehand. Great comfortable bed and pillows, huge TV with ability to stream from devices, bluetooth alarm clock (you can already stream music to your TV from your device though), Nespresso machine amongst others. I'm quite fussy and even the smaller things ticked my boxes-the premium toiletries weren't just a fancy shampoo and soap, there was conditioner and hand/body lotion too plus loads of towels. Decent hairdryer, proper iron and ironing board, seating area and big luxurious bathroom. There were a couple of issues with the bathroom, firstly I'd have preferred a rainfall shower (not that there was anything wrong with what is available and the pressure is great). Also, the floor tiles were ever so slightly grubby and the cleaning of the edges of the skirting board was non existent-hair and dirt throughout and this would have been so simple to clean, it wasn't touched throughout my stay. The room had a carpet, not a big fan of these in hotels as they're hard to clean and i doubt they're cleaned more than a daily quick vacuum so I didn't feel too clean walking barefoot. Some slightly odd cleaning decisions in the room, sometimes used glasses and glassware was entirely left and sometimes replaced. The room itself was a bit dark but plenty of mirrors and lighting around, the wardrobe was fine but most of the space is already taken with a safe and coffee machine so could have had some drawers in there plus more shelves.

The amenities in the hotel involved nice touches, I did like the filtered water machine on each floor and free fruit/cookies. The coffee shop downstairs (part of a chain but linked to the hotel) was very good, great coffee and nice food but extremely limited menu which was a shame. Apart from this there were no food options in the hotel apart from some bar snacks but with so much around this wasn't really an issue.

I was not happy with the amenity fee despite being aware in advance, it's $29 a night plus taxes and to me this is just a rip off. Include the charges in the daily rates, the hotel isn't cheap to begin with and most of the amenities such as 'local gym access' most wouldn't use. So I ended up paying almost $170 for a handful of Nespresso coffees and water that I'd expected to be completely free anyway, if we're being realistic about the situation. 

After nosing about some other hotels and having thoroughly done my research, this is one of the very best in the city and attracted a cool crowd. There are some 5* hotels locally but they seem to be very stuffy-this place is very modern. Would recommend it for sure, just a few niggles to sort as above and I have high standard!",Back of the hotel means quietest rooms. And I&#39;d ask to be as far from the elevator as possible.,3.0,4.0,,,4.0,,bbusby1,General Manager,2019-07-17,Wow....thank you sturgeon2k for such a detailed review.

I was looking for a respite between Berkeley and the San Francisco Airport and a little power shopping. I was looking for a small boutique hotel as I was traveling alone. I was influenced by the art on the web site and thought ""I love your spirit!"".  I totally hit the spot. Tiny but offered a white sangria upon entering, help to the room, which was small but full of flavor!  My favorite espresso machine was ready for me. Loved the touch of black wash cloth with words ""for face"". The bar after a day of shopping was cozy and the Bartender was the Bomb!  Oh yeah, first drink was free! Cute cafe on grounds with perfect Avocado or Salmon toast for breakfast.  The art was worth a stop on each floor and of course the nozzle for filtered water and fresh fruit and evening cookies on each floor was a great touch.

Christopher S,1,,2019-06-30,COUPLES,2019-06-23,3,"Okay, not great","The pros:the staff is friendly including being extremely gracious with early check in. The location in Union Sq is convenient for tourist stuff (walkable to Chinatown, Market, even Embaracadero, North Beach, Coit Tower).
The cons: for the price, the room was not great. Dim lighting, not as clean as expected for a similar price at larger hotels. The carpet in the hallways always needed vacuuming, there was never ice in the hallway freezer, the water filter station was a nice environment-friendly idea but it rarely worked - apparently the filters were clogged. The attempt to appear like a “hip” place came across as somewhat contrived with a silly video commercial on loop as you check and a video of a fire in the bar area that grows tiresome after you have been there once. It seems like this place spent a lot on consultants to appear hip versus similar boutique hotels that have a more authentic vibe. The mandatory resort fee stinks too, especially as we were looking forward to the yoga (in part, the reason why we stayed there) and the instructor canceled at the last minute.
Overall, I would not recommend staying here unless it was on super sale. Take all that money and go to a larger hotel that is good at what they do without trying too hard to be hip.",,,,,,,,bbusby1,General Manager,2019-06-27,"Thank you Christopher S for you review.

I was a little nauseous from our flight so I was so relieved that we were able to relax in the room for a little before we adventured out into the city. We got compliment drink tickets too which we later used at the bar and got the most deliciously interesting drinks! All of this amazing treatment from the start made our experience so nice! The quotes everywhere and the cool decor is everything and I loved it! My boyfriend especially loved how they leave out cookies at the end of the hall in the evening and a large glass to refil purified water. I know it’s the little things but they truly mean so much. After a night of drinking we loved having that big water jug in our room and so nice that it’s free and purified. Like I said earlier the bar was amazing! Also the bathroom products in the bathroom smell heavenly! So many great things about this hotel. I recommend it to a lot of my family and friends and would definitely stay here again.

We were fed up and ragged from being newly pregnant and helping my sister move all weekend. The Emblem Hotel was just the soothing medicine we needed. It was simply a dream. Upon check in we were offered a cocktail / mocktail for me and a special cocktail napkin good for another free cocktail / mocktail that night at their beautiful bar. Upon getting to our floor we discovered a communal hospitality station with a water bottle refill machine, FRESHLY BAKED CHOCOLATE COOKIES served on a marble plate , tiny tongs for selecting your citrus slice of choice to flavor your filtered water, oh and a freezer with bags of ice should you be experiencing neck problems like myself. This thoughtful station was a pregnant woman’s dream! Then we checked into the most beautiful view overlooking a serene garden. Proceeded to take a much needed hot shower in an incredible bathroom with all organic bath product, ie the first products on this trip that were safe for preggo with a baby. I then slipped into a fluffy robe with my citrus flavored water, watched my favorite show and got the best night of sleep I’ve had in weeks on the wonderful bed with wonderful pillows. Being coffee snobs we skipped the in-room nespresso bar for the fresh made stuff downstairs. Quick and easy. The service was wonderful there and at the hotel. This hotel rescued our weekend. I will agree the walls are thin, we could hear the next room talking but they were reasonably noisy and it didn’t bother us much as we stuffed our face with complimentary cookies. Heavenly.

kayciereyes,3,,2019-03-31,NONE,2019-04-01,5,My New Favorite Hotel In San Francisco,"What an experience, a hotel that literally is inspired by my other favorite place, a library or a home study. 

Upon arrival, Gintanjali (sp?) & Julia greeted me at the front desk. They were both very warm & friendly, their outfits were super cute. The check in process was fantastic as they were able to accommodate my request for a single bed & concluded with a complimentary Aperol welcome cocktail. Gitanjali invited me over into their lobby bar to try one of their signature cocktails on her sometime during my stay, & I loved that their version of a drink voucher is actually a dated bar napkin. 

The room was perfect for me, but just felt like it was missing a small corner desk somewhere or a small table for one.  Not to fret, but their lobby bar space during the day was the perfect place to get some work & studying done. But that deter from the fact that I loved that the windows fully opened so I didn't feel trapped inside of my room & that open air could actually circulate the room during a warm day instead of having to use the A/C. There wasn't a screen, but I prefer windows without them (they're kinda dusty) & no bugs flew into my room. I honestly didn't care about the view of the yellow brick wall directly in front of me at all.  

The beds are EXTREMELY comfortable. Loved it so much that I actually spent my last night in San Francisco not getting out of it from 4pm til the next morning.

SirGooch,32,"Laguna Beach, California",2019-03-31,COUPLES,2019-03-25,5,Hip place to stay with wonderful service!,"As you enter the lobby, you get that cool Beat Generation vibe from the décor and we were immediately greeted by Julia at the front desk with a friendly smile and offer of that day's welcoming cocktail. Check-in was fast, easy and Julia arranged for our car to be valet parked. She also explained all the hotel amenities and her enthusiasm sold us on the yoga and cocktail making classes they make available to all the guests on Saturdays.

The newly-designed hotel has really only been open since February so the rooms are all freshly furnished and comfortable, again carrying through designs focused on writers with cool quotes hidden written in places like behind the towels and on the bathroom ceiling. The bed and comforter was comfy and the TV was huge dominating a wall. 

Yoga in the morning was wonderful and the instructor was very soothing and tailored the class to accommodate the yoga newbies that my wife and I are. Coffee afterwards at the small attached café was the best.

We got back to the hotel late afternoon and stumbled into the Bar Obscenity just in time for Nora's cocktail class. Although she looks young, Nora is an experienced &  humble cocktail genius and decided to treat us with unique versions of ""Old Fashioned"" cocktails. Using the basic recipe of a spirit, a sweetener & a bitter, she created amazing drinks using whiskey, vodka, & tequila. My favorite... whiskey, cherry syrup, chocolate bitters with a grapefruit peel twist in a glass filled with black tea smoke. Amazing! I also can't omit mentioning that we were fortunate to have Stephanie from the business office joining us at the cocktail class. Like all the other employees we met, she was incredibly friendly and enthusiastic about the hotel and all it had to offer.

Our room wasn't ready when we arrived early at 1.30pm but reception found us a room that was ready and moved us so we could check in early after a long trip to SF.  We let reception know it was our honeymoon and they left a sweet note in our room with complimentary cocktails,  you also get a cocktail on arrival. 
The rooms were perfect with high quality furnishings & linen.  The tv was huge,  there was a water fountain on each floor with sliced lemon, lime and fruit you could help yourself to. Our window opened to a fire escape which we thought was great as we were so high up it was a great view. The bathroom was beautiful with a great shower and huge towels. 

The location was perfect, 5min or less walk to Union Square where we caught the cable car to and from Fisherman's Wharf. Bars and restaurants are abundant in the area.

The location of the Emblem is excellent, just off Union square so central for shopping, bars and restaurants. The hotel was very new when we stayed having opened in January, we had a small issue in our room (513) with the bathroom door and the main door not being able to be opened at the same time as the hinges clashed, this was initially a pain but we got used to it and the hotel say that they are fixing it. When we raised this issue with reception they sent a note apologizing and some wine to the room which was a lovely gesture. The hotel is very cool in design with great little details, the bed was exceptionally comfortable and the bathroom was sleek with a great shower and lovely toiletries.

There is a heavy nod to the Beat Generation...perfectly situated between nostalgia and modern design.  The room we stayed in was perfect, great art and fun pillows all owning back to the concept.  For us a good bed and good water pressure are essentials...and they had both!

The only thing I don’t like about the room was the lighting of toilet. Guess it was a kind of environmental-friendly design, which the light will turn off automatically(and very suddenly) if the sensor detects no people/ movement in the toilet. The toilet was foggy while having shower, (guess the sensor can’t detect) and the lighting turned off so suddenly..... which was a bit scary.

martik,2,,2019-02-28,BUSINESS,2019-02-12,5,A little gem in the heart of Union Square,"This boutique hotel recently opened and has an art deco vibe. The art work on the walls and quotes printed on the carpet and walls were fun to read and added a quirky feel. The rooms were very clean, well appointed and service was personalized.  The bar was not open yet but looks like it will definitely be a favorite among guests and locals alike. The decorations were trendy and upbeat with a fireplace screen on the wall to give that cozy feel as well. Supposedly they will be serving custom cocktails too. Can't wait to go back!",,,5.0,,5.0,5.0,,bbusby1,General Manager,2019-02-13,"Thank you martiko, we're so glad you enjoyed Hotel Emblem!

G M,219,"Orlando, Florida",2019-01-31,BUSINESS,2019-02-03,3,Make sure the Hotel is Fully Open,"The hotel was not fully open when I stayed here. It was in the very fine print of the site after I booked, but not in my reservation. It was advertised as an opening sale. It's just it wasn't open. The hotel staff was great, courteous and thoughtful. It felt as if they were schooled to compensate for the hotel's deficiencies. The room was renovated, including the smell of fresh paint. The floor was sloped in the room, there's really no explaining this. The cafe was still in the middle of construction. There is a nearby parking garage that has a practice of beeping the car horns as the cars exit, this begins around 6 AM. Overall the place was not ready to be open, and shouldn't have been booking a guest.",,,4.0,,3.0,,4.0,bbusby1,General Manager,2019-02-05,"Thank you GM433 for staying with us at Hotel Emblem.  I apologize that we weren't quite finished with our renovation when you arrived, but I'm glad to see that our team went above and beyond to make your experience as enjoyable as possible.  I'd be interested in discussing the other items you mentioned in more detail, if you have the opportunity please feel free to reach out to me directly.",46
