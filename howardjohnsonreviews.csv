As we know 2020 everything shut down, including the hotels and Disneyland! The staff went above and beyond to help us postpone the trip over and over and never once did I feel like a burden. When we finally successfully scheduled the trip it was perfect. Our room was so clean, hotel was decorated for the holidays adorably and the bed!! We both slept so well we could have stayed all day.

Wendy K,30,"Concord, California",2021-11-30,NONE,2021-11-23,5,Pleasant Surprise!,"I went with this hotel after seeing the sky high prices of the California Grand. We wanted to be within walking distance, and with more space/room since there were 3 of us. The fact that there were 2 bathrooms sealed the deal, so I reluctantly booked, not expecting much (I'm a bit of a hotel snob).   We went with the 2 bedroom which was a master with a king bed/bathroom and a bunk bed/2nd bathroom suite.  Best decision ever!  The hotel staff was super friendly and accommodating. This was a last minute trip and they still managed to get some birthday balloons for my daughter in our room even though the gift shop was closed.  Our room was recently updated. SUPER clean, PLENTY of room! After spending all day at the park, it was nice for all of us to have our ""space"" - you could just shut the bedroom door and it was almost like having separate adjoining rooms but without the risk.   Our daughter is 16, and that room had a bunk bed, couch, table, bathroom and TV.  we could have easily brought another friend.  Our room had a giant comfortable bed, tv, bathroom, and refrigerator.  The park was SUPER close.  easily walkable. There is a McDonalds on the way, so we quickly  would grab some breakfast.  There are also some other restaurants that we never ate it, but they are literally within a block or two.  there is a super cool pool/mini water park area but we never used it. We definitely would have had we stayed longer.  This will be my go to from now on.

Kyle_10,90,"Modesto, California",2021-11-30,NONE,2021-11-22,5,Very pleased with this stay,"We've had a few different friends and coworkers recommend this hotel.  We go to Disneyland twice per year and have stayed at the Disneyland Hotel every time with the exception of this past May when we stayed at the Grand Californian.  When I went to book this past trip, I was shocked at how much prices have gone up at the Disney owned hotels.  I considered staying at Paradise Pier but even then the price just seemed like a lot and looking at the Howard Johnson it was distance wise no further than the Disneyland Hotel and price was a couple hundred dollars per night cheaper.

When we got here, check-in was super easy.  We were complimentary upgraded to a room with two queen size beds.  Parking was free the whole stay (not sure if that's typical) 

We really didn't do anything other than sleep, shower, and dress there.  I can't tell you much about the pool/water park etc.  But the room was clean.  It was themed for Disneyland with paintings of Mickey on the walls.  The TV had Youtube and Netflix available on it.  The walk took us right past Panera and McDonalds as well as a little convenience store where we bought bottled waters and snacks for our daughter on the way back from the parks each night.

Honestly, we didn't think the actual room at the Grand Californian was any nicer than the room at the Howard Johnson.  The lobby is nothing magical but who cares?  Save yourself hundreds of dollars and spend it in the park on a nice meal or merch.",,,5.0,,,5.0,5.0,,,,,68

Only con I would say is that the cell reception wasn’t that great inside the building. I never connected to the hotel wifi, but I had to walk out into the parking lot in the morning just before 7am to secure tickets for rise of the resistance and Spider-Man each day. I wasn’t the only one in the parking lot either, there was several other people doing the same thing. All that said I would definitely stay here again, had a wonderful experience. ",,,,,,,,,,,,0

DCEowner,290,"New Lenox, Illinois",2021-11-30,COUPLES,2021-11-19,5,Fabulous Hotel w/water park-walking distance to Disney,"We stayed in building two and we had lovely renovated rooms with a touch of Mickey Mouse in the decorating. The hotel was very clean, friendly, and super close to Disneyland. It was unusually hot for November and we were lucky that we could come back to the hotel since it was so close to the park. It was just a 10 minute walk and we could stop by Panera and McDonald's on the way. At first we were a little put off by the pool reservation system. When we arrived and tried to reserve A time slot (they were in two hour increments with a half hour gap between sessions), there were no available times for all five days we were going to be there at the waterpark except for 8 o'clock to 10:00 PM when it was getting cold and our little kids would be tired. We did find out that you can call or check in at either of the pools a half hour after the session starts. If people didn't show up for their reserved time, you could then go in. That way we were able to get in anytime we wanted. Overall, the place was wonderful! It even had cute Christmas decorations and a lovely giant tree.

But the water was freeeezing! Many kids had a hard time getting in. Most wanted to sit in the hot tub. Way different than our previous experience. We were not able to enjoy it. 
Mentioned it to the staff at the pool, at check out and email but everyone seemed to brush aside.

David Susan,1,,2021-10-31,NONE,2021-11-13,3,Not for a family of 5,"For the most part the hotel is good, the location is great, and the staff are friendly. The walk to the Disney park gates is less than 10 minutes, with a few places to grab breakfast on the way by. 
Why 3 stars??? This hotel is set up to accommodate young families or maximum 4 in a room. We booked through our airline as part of a package including both hotel and airfare. When the booking was made we were reassured that 5 people could fit into the rooms and each person would fit. At check in we were assigned a room with 2 queen sized beds and informed that rollaway beds were an extra charge. With 2 adults and 3 adolescents in a room there was no way we would fit in 2 queen beds. 
The issue with the beds was likely our airline's fault, versus the hotel's, and the hotel did end up providing the rollaway cot for free. Unfortunately, the size of the room and potential extra cost for a rollaway bed makes this hotel more suited for maximum of 4 in a room. Next trip, we will be looking at other hotels in the area that have a better selection of rooms for larger families. Very sad about this as this has previously been a favorite of our family. 
A few other things to be aware of...
The pool/water playground need to be booked in advance due to COVID. Only 1 booking can be made per room per day. Again, having 5 people in a room made booking difficult as the system is only set up for 4 people. The hot tub is in the water playground area, so if you want a soak in hot water after the park you need to book there. There is not a way to use both the pool and the hot tub on the same day. Also, those under 16 are not allowed in the pool/water playground without an adult, no exceptions. Again, not very friendly for those kids that are old enough to be somewhat independent. 
A parking fee is now charged per night, we booked prior to this announcement so did not have to pay the fee this time. 
My suggestion to the hotel: put some bunkbeds that have a double on the bottom and single on the top to fit 5 people.

theratherts4,1,,2021-10-31,NONE,2021-10-25,3,"Nice hotel, wonderful family suite but dirty and terrible pool schedule.","We stayed in the family suite which was wonderful as far as space.  All 3 kids and parents were very happy.  We were disappointed with toothpaste all over the walls, door, mirrors and art in the bathroom as well as splatters of something on the mirrors in the main room.  We informed the front desk and someone came in and cleaned the bathroom mirror but the rest remained.  The most frustrating thing was the pool schedule.  I understand needing to schedule pool time due to covid but the pre set 2 hour windows with half hour breaks in between were ridiculous!  None of the times were when we wanted to go to the pool and when we finally did get to the pool with only 45 minutes left in the current session we were kicked out (actually woken up from a delightful snooze in the sun) at the end when there wasn’t even another family in the pool area.  I stayed outside to see what kind of magic the lifeguard ( gate police) were doing during that half hour and I saw them straighten a couple chairs then sit in the sun.  I was furious that I had to schedule my relaxing time when I had paid a premium for a hotel with a nice pool and we really couldn’t even use it.  Maybe this was necessary in the summer if it was packed but when we were there the busiest I ever saw it was 3 families.  Because of the pool situation I will not stay at the Howard Johnson again and will not recommend it to others.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,1

The location is good, not too far from Disneyland but the walk can be a bit tough after a full dat in the park.  The grounds are excellent, though parking is a bit tight.  The staff was very friendly and accommodating.  We stayed in  room 3108, which is right behind the lobby.  It was a king sized room with accessible features (which we didn't request, but were fine with).  The bed was amazing!  One of the best mattresses and pillows I've ever slept on at a hotel, slept better here than I do at home.  Rest of room was good.  Lots of outlets, there was a fridge, microwave and coffee maker.  Was a bit weird there was only one night stand though.  Bathroom was good, zero entry shower because it was an accessible room.  Though that did leave some huge puddles on the floor that I almost slipped in a few times.  Lack of counter space in the bathroom was a challenge for a couple having to keep their toiletries in various different places.  Our room also had a patio thought we never used it.  Also didn't use either of the pools, the reservation system was a lit inconvenient for the style of pool users we are.

The only thing keeping us from staying here again is the location.  The walk after a long day of Disney was a bit much, but I'll admit we aren't in the best shape.  I think this property is great for families with kids, and that is mostly what we saw there.",,,,,,,,Hojo Anaheim,Guest Services / Front Office,2021-10-25,"Thank you so much for your kind comments and positive feedback!

California Dude,65,"San Jose, California",2021-10-31,NONE,2021-10-03,4,"Nice rooms, very close to Disneyland","My son and I stayed her for his 16th birthday trip to Disneyland.  This is a good hotel with just a few minor issues.

Pros:
* Walking distance to Disneyland.  From room to main entrance, it's a little under 10 minutes.
* Staff was very nice and friendly.
* Pool areas is good with small slide, kiddie pool, and hot tub among other items.
* Gift store has everything you might need at a price you would expect from this type of store (aka, higher than your normal store at home, but not over the top).
* Room was very clean

Cons:
* We had requested towel and trash service on one of the day and it never happened (they will not clean the room or swap towels until you call in advance, which we did).
* Prior to checking in, I had emailed them a question about their pool areas, but never received a response.

Overall, this is a good hotel and I would gladly stay here again as the minor issues are easy to fix.",,,4.0,5.0,,,5.0,,,,,65

However, this was my first time taking my two year old and we were going two days in a row so I didn’t want to make the haul home and then wake him up early again the next morning so we decided to stay. I am soooo glad we did! He was a hot mess halfway through our first day and the hotel allowed us an early check in so I was able to lay him down for a nap, and let him cool off at the water play area. The desk attendant was so helpful in making us a reservation since I forgot to make one for the pool, as well as distracting my unruly toddler as I tried to check in. My mother decided to stay with us last minute so she offered an upgraded room with two beds and a view of the Matterhorn! The rooms were beautifully done, clean and convenient, and (my favorite part) there is an Alexa in the room!! This made everything so easy and I was able to play white noise for the baby, and his favorite songs while we got ready. Overall great experience and super friendly and helpful staff.

The hotel staff is also flexible when it comes to pool reservations if you call and ask (we were running late one day and we called to let them know).

amandaschulte92,1,"Las Vegas, Nevada",2021-09-30,NONE,2021-09-27,5,Fantastic stay,"We arrived Thursday afternoon and stayed until Sunday afternoon. 
Reserved an evening time at the kids play are which was awesome! Staff was very proactive, I even saw a staff member catch a girl who was under water for too long (her parent not paying attention). They also notified me when my daughter got in the spa to make sure I kept an eye on her. I appreciated them caring enough to communicate with me! 
The room was fine- 2 queen beds 
We had a highway view which sounded disappointing but once in the room realized they double panel the balcony reducing the noise almost 100%. I barely heard the cars at night it was great! 
Included in room were mini fridge, microwave and coffee maker. This allowed us to bring some stuff for breakfast and make it ourself in the room which saved us some money. 

CUSTOMER SERVICE: fantastic!!!! We called for extra towels, trash/dirty towel pickup, help with a luggage cart, and info on the pool and shuttle. The service we received during all these times was fantastic. You have a great team here! 
20% off coupon for Mimi’s Cafe which the front desk told us about so we used that on our departure. 
Proximity was about 10 minute walk from entrance gates of Disney to the door of the hotel.

Reported & supposedly fixed only to come back at 11pm with sleeping kids to a hot room . Too frustrated and annoyed to report at 11pm. My 2 year old Son threw up in the bed that night , reported the ac in the morning along with house keeping to change the sheets and pillowcases . The housekeepers came and did a great job. Ac was never fixed I called the next morning because we got back to out rooms after 11pm after being at Disneyland and the front desk had the audacity to say that because I had two rooms and one room had a do not disturb sign they never came in to fix the ac. The room with the do not disturb was not reported at all, how did housekeeping know which room to come to and the maintenance didn’t? Frustrating and irritating to deal with. Also if you plan on staying here make sure you prebook your water park time online. I didn’t know there were appointments necessary because the website did not specify this nor did it have any information on my confirmation email. I booked direct and paid in full … two days later is when I received an email  with the water park information. I didn’t open it because I was busy and already paid and was overlooked and not expected. This was another frustrating discovery when I arrived to the hotel with a whole day planned on my head to spend relaxing in the 95 degree weather the day before I go to Disney for a few days.

Mel,2,"Los Angeles, California",2021-09-30,COUPLES,2021-09-22,1,Anniversary Trip,"We booked 2 nights for our 5th wedding anniversary. This hotel is often talked about in the Disney community and thought our stay could be super special! I’ve seen all the influencers share their experience and it always looks amazing. What we got was an experience worse than a motel in Timbuktu. Upon arrival, I mentioned it was our anniversary hoping we could get some kind of room upgrade or even a card or SOMETHING. We didn’t even get a “happy anniversary” from the check in desk staff. When we entered the building where our room was, there was an overwhelming cleaning solution smell that gave me a headache and the carpet was disgusting. Our old rooms must have had old plumbing too because our sink was clogged! The toilet paper was almost out as well! The next day we went to Disneyland and expected housekeeping. They didn’t even enter into our room AT ALL! Super disappointing to come back to unmade bed on our anniversary and no clean towels! It was also hard to fall asleep with our rooms being by the freeway with loud car noises and the top window not being covered. I’m just glad we didn’t bring our toddler because I know we would complain like most people about the unneeded reservation system for their pool/playground. But overall really unhappy that our anniversary stay was like this when other hotels we’ve stayed at would have been more exciting and more accommodating.

porkchop1496,80,,2021-09-30,NONE,2021-09-19,4,Pleasantly surprised by Hojo,"I'd never stayed in a Hojo, but decided that this would be a great place to try - plus I got the Wyndham CC and figured I'd see how the rewards work for it. Anyway, it was perfect for a day trip to Disneyland with 2 nights there. We were on the 5th floor of the 1st building with a view of I-5, but the first night we were there we could walk over to the fire escape balcony and see Disney fireworks, which was nice because the next day (when we were in the park) it was just a light show. The waterpark was nice and they let us arrive a little more than half hour late. It seems a little overkill with all the reservations and wristbands, but it's a large hotel and that water park could get overrun. It was nice to not have to fight for a spot to sit. We did a pool reservation before we checked out, but it was kind of cold in the morning. The kids loved the bunk beds in the room and the water park, plus they got pirate hats and balloon swords upon checkin. The room was pretty clean but the tub had a clog with gross fingernail clippings that kept coming back up. I called maintenance to fix that, which occurred promptly. You are supposed to ask for trash/towel service by a certain time in the morning if you want it, and I did that but via the Alexa service in the room, which evidently does not work. Housekeeping still did it once I asked the front desk later in the day. Disneyland is super close and an easy walk to the entrance. We even went back to the hotel room for a nap. There are many chain restaurants nearby - beware that literally every place is hiring right now and service is spotty. We still ate well, though, and the hotel provided coupons for both Panera and Mimi's.  There is also a Target down the road that we got drive up for to ensure we had snacks ready. We were on a longer trip and even used the laundry room at the Hojo - one of the dryers didn't work very effectively, but finally we got the clothes cleaned and dried! I'd stay here again if I were to return to Disney, and I'm now curious to try other Hojos for family vacations.",,,3.0,3.0,5.0,,,,,,,75

We even rode the water slide a few times. If you're going to be staying in the area with kids you need to stay here. It's a short walk from Disney and an a great hotel!

bethanylyngr,17,,2021-08-31,FAMILY,2021-08-28,1,We strive for 5 stars but don’t put in the effort to get 5 stars.,"To start: check in was great the man was very helpful and we were able to check in the morning. We decided to choose this hotel for our toddler since she likes small slides and it was perfect for her. The first problem started when they told us, you have to make reservations for the water park and parking costs. Which while booking through the Wyndham app, both of those details were left out. As you can imagine planning a reservation around a toddlers nap and food times was challenging especially due to their rule of you have to check in to your pool reservation 30 minutes before your time or they cancel and give away your reservation. So you get to the gate and then wait 30 minutes which was pretty inefficient in our option. They also say only 2 hours allowed per day per room and up to 4 people. The point of staying was for the water park and 2 hours doesn’t seem like enough. But the first day we ended up making a reservation for the water park and standing around waiting for the time just to find out that the all the small slides are closed and only the big one was open which ruined the whole point. They of course didn’t have a reopening time for them. Right then we wanted to switch to the Marriott across the street. Called Marriott and they told us it was all open and everything but the guy at the Howard Johnson told us no, their water park isn’t all open and they have a reservation system as well because the Howard and the Marriott are owned by the same people which I highly doubt but okay. Unfortunately we didn’t make it to the water park the second day due to Disneyland but on third day when the water park opened we inquired about reservations and they were open luckily and we saw that the small slides were finally opened. So we rushed to get our stuff together knowing that check out was up soon. So we called the front desk to ask for check out at 12:30 instead of 12 and the lady said no, completely booked up which we replied that we found rooms still available online and mid sentence she hung up. Completely rude customer service. We won’t be a repeat customer. Disappointing to say the least. We don’t even need to talk about the extra charges that don’t match my Wyndham reservation through the app. In the room it says we strive for 5 stars but their customer service proves that they aren’t even trying to help or care. We are currently at the Anaheim hotel and their service is phenomenal and they really helped us after our horrible experience at Howard.",Be warned when booking in Wyndham app since the details about parking and pool reservation and limiting 2 hours a day,,,,,,,Guest Services,Guest Services / Front Office,2021-09-03,"We greatly appreciate your feedback on your recent stay with us. We are sorry to hear you did not have a 5 star experience during your stay with us. We understand it can be difficult to make plans with toddler and we are more than happy notify our pool attendants if you will be arriving late so that they will keep your reservation until you arrive, or move your reservation to a time that works better for you. We have added the pool reservation system to give everyone the opportunity to use our aquatic facilities, especially in the summer time when the pool areas normally get very crowded. In order to achieve this, we are allowing our guests to make two 2-hour reservations per day of their stay. These reservation times are spaced by 30 minute cleaning intervals so our pool attendants can sanitize the areas. We will be working with Wyndham to have the app updated to reflect our new procedures. We also apologize that one of the slides was closed during your stay. Our pool attendant noticed that there was a small crack in the slide and for the safety of our guests, we had to close it down to prevent any injuries. We are glad to hear you were able to go to Castaway Cove the following day. It sounds as though the call may have dropped while you were speaking with our Front Desk Associate, however, there are times in which we can be flexible with our check out times and we will address this with our staff.

The food was a short walk thru the hotel across the street and at the corner :(  but it was good and the waitress was hysterical.  Try the Lemon cake.
Lost of room in a double queen bed room for 2 adults and 2 kids, no worries lots of space.
NO bellhop guys.  Do it yourself.  But then again, tipped myself too.
Lots of light, airy rooms, a tiny balcony to watch the pool people.  I think the only thing missing was a towel rod for the balcony.  A ton of visitors were drying thier wet clothes on the balcony.

We have stayed in more than a dozen locations in the last 2 years and NO ONE did as GREAT a job as HOJO Anaheim!!!!
The cleaning between rooms, wipes in the room, pool and waterpark reservation system, mask policy and front desk policy  are all great ways to keep clean, distanced and safe! 

The in room ALEXA where we can request service is the best.  It also plays music which my teens loved playing with!  

The walk to the park is easy!!!  We come back and forth as needed in the day.  We love watching the fireworks from the grounds here or from our balcony.

We are a bit hesitant to eat indoors, but the number of choices for carry out from the nearby Gardenwalk or Downtown Disney area makes it easy to feed us all or dine outside.

We find the staff here super friendly efficient and helpful!!!  They make us feel like family when we are here.

We can say with authority that we highly recommend Hojo Anaheim!  They have performed better than many high dollar locations during this crazy time.  We feel safe and pampered.

The beds and pillows are also very comfy. The grounds are immaculate, very clean, beautiful flowers, and feels like a resort. Its easy to get to even the furthest room and the area is secure. I travelled alone with my 6 year old. I chose this property for the pirate waterpark and laundry. The laundry facilities are new and really nice (and affordable!). The waterpark is the perfect size so that the kids can run around and have fun and you can relax and still keep an eye on them. The pool staff is really friendly. The entire staff is amazing, I had emailed a question before my trip and Kriss was so helpful and even when I was checking out, Michael was helping me plan my next stay there.

Erin C,13,Canada,2021-08-31,COUPLES,2021-08-15,3,It was good but not great,"Before I start, this was a trip redo, our first experience was awful and they graciously gave us a great deal to return and try again. While this experience was better, it lacked in some pretty important places. 1. Check in staff were fantastic and the staff as a whole, were friendly and amazing! So 5/5 there!!! The room, was dirty… again! This was a large part of our issues the first time and it appears no different this time, which was unfortunate especially given the whole Covid thing. We wiped the table in the room with a Lysol wipe and it was black. The seat, even worse! The pedestal on the table was not only dusty but had dried food on it. The lamps so dusty, I could write my name! So… 0/5 for clean. I wish I could give a better rating but I know we were not alone as another guest, who we ran into outside found his room dirty as well at check in, with bloody pillows - covered in blood stains and filthy found in a cot he had paid extra for, clearly not cleaning the way they should.  housekeeping appears to be lacking. The pool reservations are tough, but it is what it is given the current times we are in, staff handled it very well and did all they could to accommodate, so kudos to them for that! Pool attendants were on the ball, very good and friendly! 5/5 for those staff as well!!!!!  

We came from Canada, long journey and during Covid had chose to give this a try, because of videos we saw around cleaning posted when they reopened. Unfortunately we didn’t experience that level of care or clean, during our 7 day stay. Which was disappointing! 

No housekeeping daily, even when we asked for it - it didn’t happen! Got some new towels and toilet paper but Even those requests sometimes took multiple asks to receive! Maybe they’re low staff given Covid and reopening but some things are harder to accept as okay, than others!!! 

Would we stay here again? Not sure honesty, the cleanliness issues are a big thing for us and especially given the current times!

We were so pleased with our experience. Staff were all very friendly and helpful, and allowed us to check in a few hours early. We had three double rooms, and one family suite. The double rooms were surprisingly spacious, and very very clean. It was nice to have an additional sink outside of the bathroom. The mini fridge is very small, but was fine for our needs. We found the rooms to be very quiet…didn’t hear our neighbors at all except in the hall way.  Very comfy beds. Just a heads up, some of the 2-story buildings (at least buildings 2 and 3) do not have elevators, so request a first floor room if you have a baby and stroller!  The family suite was amazing, really spacious.  Housekeeping was short-staffed so they only serviced our rooms upon request. 
  The Castaway Cove water park is what drew us to Hojo. Our five year old and three year old had a ball, and the zero entry wading pool was terrific for little ones.

kristinaacontreras,1,,2021-08-31,NONE,2021-08-08,1,OVERPROMISE & UNDERDELIVER,"We have stayed at this hotel multiple times, and do Disney vacations multiple times a year. This hotel used to be great, which is why I would also recommend countless people here, but under new management this hotel has gone down the drain. I absolutely would not recommend this hotel to anyone or stay here again. During our last stay we were put in a building that was construction, where you could smell all the chemicals, and my daughter left the hotel covered in more than 7 big bites. But at least then the management was nice and apologetic and at least acted as if they cared.  On our stay today we were moved to a building which was not the one we had booked, only to find out that we were given a room in which the TV didn't work. Not a big deal except for the way it was handled. It took 3 seperate visits by maintenance to get it fixed over 2 hours. Considering we were only here for one night with the intention of relaxing after my husband worked 5 12 hours shifts and couldn't take a nap since the kids couldn't be occupied and there was a man working in the room installing a new tv while he attempted to sleep. Who can sleep with someone they don't know in the room? Lol. He's now back to work for another shift with no rest. One manager was very helpful and promised us compensation, just to have the manager on duty the next day yell at my husband, speak extremely rudely when he simply brought up what was promised. Needless to say nothing was done to fix the experience or compensated, as promised. Be very careful what you're told by staff here and take it with a grain of salt, depending on who you speak to their policies change with the wind, including when you have them in writing. The woman reuined our vacation, and instead of apologizing for the hotel's short comings and any ""misinformation"" given to us by managers and staff, she blamed us the hotel guests. It was bizarre to say the least.  We were actually planning to book a second night at the hotel, but upon the experience with her, our minds changed very quickly.  On top of all this I had to take my kids to the gift shop just distract them so he could sleep for 10 mins, the toys there are overpriced. They've been marked up more than double. I paid $40 for 2 tiny little stuffed animals, marked on Amazon for $9 each. $40 for a 10 min nap, this hotel is really good finding ways to make you spend more money. Parking is $20 a day on top of reservation as well, no big deal to me, but thought I'd mention it so people know ahead when they're factoring costs. Don't come here.  I was told, in writing on their Facebook page, that we could use the waterpark, with a reservation, on our checkout date, only for the rude, yelling manager to retract this. She did not care what other staff had promised. Stay literally anywhere else.   Overall her behavior was downright inappropriate. Hojo please do not hire managers without customer service training.  I have literally never heard of workers being in the room actively making repairs, while guests are sleeping/during their stay. The whole tv had to be taken off the wall and a new one reinstalled. This is the equivalent of having construction done in your room while you're staying, only after being put in a room that wasn't the one you booked. I was a frequent visitor to this hotel, who constantly recommended people here and I will now be retracting those recommendations and making sure people steer clear of this place. People deserve to know what their paying for and how inappropriate their entire experience will be here under new management staff.   I really wish we had stayed home where we would have gotten more rest.   Message me for a list of other hotels by Disney that are actually good. We've stayed at least 5 others that I can recommend.

K D,18,"San Francisco, California",2021-07-31,NONE,2021-08-03,5,Perfect hotel for Disney visitors!,"We are a family of 4 and we absolutely loved the HoJo Anaheim! We stayed in Building 1 in a room with 2 queen beds for 3 nights during our trip to Disneyland.  

- The room was clean, spacious, modern/updated, and surprisingly sound-proof (couldn't hear neighbors through the wall nor did we hear much noise from passersby in the hall). 

- Front desk and housekeep staff were readily available, friendly, and helpful. 

- Our beds were comfy (high-quality mattresses, not too firm and not too soft), and the shower water pressure was pretty good.  Aircon worked perfectly and kept our room nice and cool.

- Keurig coffee machine came with pods and sugar/creamer, there's a minifridge, and a microwave too. 

- Room was thoughtfully designed, with power outlets and USB ports everywhere, even in the microwave and alarm clock! 

- I believe parking was free. They have a large lot but it can get full so you may need to park a little further away from your room....not a big deal though since you'll still be close. Upon your first entry into the lot, just hit the call button, give the attendant your reservation name, and they'll open the gate for you. After you check in, you'll need your room card to enter the lot; no room card needed to exit.  

- Our kids are 18 and 16 so we never checked out the water park, but it sure sounded like the little ones there were having fun! If my kids were younger, I'd probably hit Disney in the morning, then head back to the hotel for a quick water slide break to cool off in the blazing afternoon heat, then head back to Disney around 5 when it's cooler out. 

- Location was superb, only an 8-minute walk to Disneyland. 

- We loved standing on our balcony and watching the Disney fireworks every night at 9pm. Magical!!! 

- Only 2 minor quibbles: Not all of the power outlets worked (but this is common at all hotels), and the safe was broken.  

TIP: May want to bring eyemasks. Our room had high cove windows that didn't have shades. Bright sunlight flooded our room  early every morning and woke us up.   

We've stayed in fine hotels all over the globe, and Hojo Anaheim ranks right up there with the world's best. We were very impressed and had a wonderful experience!

I called two weeks in advance because I did see that we needed to schedule a two hour window per day for the water park due to new covid restrictions . When I called the lady told me I didn’t have to reserve a time and was able to use the park as we wished. Once we arrived my kids were not able to use the water amenities as we wished (as stated by the receptionist) and everything was completely booked for the two hour windows. At one point my kids had to use the water park from 8- 10pm…. Too late for small kids to be using a water park. Not worth it!! The amount that we paid was high for not being able to pick our desired times that were already restricted to begin with.

Rooms were a tad outdated but very sufficient with supplies and a nice tv. You could not hear the neighbors. Enjoyed a fireworks show every evening thanks to Disney.

Delilah,1,,2021-07-31,FAMILY,2021-07-30,3,So-so,"After I purchased 1 night stay,I got message through Expedia that I only can make 2 reservation for 2 different pools. The pool online reservation kept giving me “invalid confirmation” so I had to call&for each reservation they will ask my name,phone,email for sending the confirmation. In which,beating the purpose of me planning to let my kids play while im working. I ended up spending lots of extra time to make the reservation.For the time block that was already full,I could call 30 min after to see if theres any no show so I could go. Again, the process repeats,giving name,phone,,email. 

When I asked my 12 yrs old son to call the front desk,didnt seem like he was being acknowledged either. He said the lady asked for me,in which I was in the middle of phone meeting&I had to let her know my name,phone,email (in which my son knew that by heart). She wasnt friendly either “I can only give you two lounger chairs”& when we got there it was total of 4 families.  Which was great and plenty of empty loungers 15-20 ft distanced apart. 

I just don’t understand why im spending $290 stay with so much trouble using the amenities. And felt treated as if I’m requesting for freebie (using the pool). 

It will be better if I knew it ahead of time,if its posted before non refundable reservation was placed,so I could made informed decision instead of feeling tricked.

I understand Covid-19 precautions,as I’m a Public Health Nurse myself,but it was a courtesy to inform dont u think? Plus why have room available when 90%pool time unavailable?

The up side was it was 9 min walk to Downtown Disney and Mimis Cafe only across the hotel. So that convenient.

There was a sign to ask for manager to make sure we voice our concern to assure 5 stars satisfaction. But honestly, I dont wanna spend extra minutes explaining and arguing. 

Seems like other hotels nearby also enforced the similar pool reservation system, so I’ll be paying attention next time.

By the way, the waterpark is small, In my opinion will be great for kids 7 yrs younger. My 6 yrs old was done after an hour, but that was because we have Raging Waters season pass. But then again, the reason I chose this hotel, was hoping I could easily supervised them having fun while I’m working. In such a smaller perimeter.

nachoann,9,"Oakland, California",2021-07-31,NONE,2021-07-26,5,Best hotel to stay at for Disney parks,"I think this is the best hotel to stay in when you visit the Disneyland parks and here's why. First of all it's within a 10 minute walk to the park gates so you don't need to worry about shuttles. Second of all it's not as pricey as any of the 3 Disneyland brand hotels but it still kinda feels like a Disneyland hotel (it has Mickey Mouse artwork in rooms, festive interior design, and a small shop on site that carries Disney souvenirs and snacks) AND has a totally awesome pirate-themed water playground that my 6 year old niece loved-loved-loved. You can definitely pay a little less elsewhere and stay a little closer to the Disney parks gates...but do they have a water playground? No. Do they 'feel' fun and festive like a Disneyland hotel might? Not sure actually...but I didn't get that vibe walking past them. So I feel the ROI on this one is the highest anywhere in town. Also I was so moved by the front desk staff member who helped me upon check-in (I think her name was Paula)...one of my family members couldn't make the trip at the last minute and she let me cancel his room free of charge. She also gave me lots of great tips of how to navigate the amusement parks in the area. Thank you Howard Johnson Anaheim Hotel and Water Playground & staff for an awesome stay! :D Oh P.S.

erikaroa760,1,,2021-07-31,NONE,2021-07-24,3,They don't offer safety vest for the kids at the poo,"Even though we are now back home, I cannot help to feel that the outcome of this trip could of have been tragic one.
On our first day we a reservation to the cast away cove from 5:00 pm - 7:00 pm. We then went out for dinner then headed back to the hotel for our reservation at the garden pool from 8:30 pm - 10:00 pm. We got the garden pool and I asked the lifeguard if I could get a safety vest for the kids.  He proceeded to tell me that they didn't have safety vest for the kids.  I was a bit stunned given that we were in a ""family/kid friendly"" hotel.  I then decided to move my chair closer to the pool so I could keep an eye on the kids since it was dark.  My husband needed to get something from our room so he got up and walked out of the pool I looked up to see him walk away.  In those 10-15 seconds that I looked away my four year old son let go of the rail (by the stairs) and by the time I looked back only the top part of his head was out of the water.  If I stretched out my arm he would not of grabbed it because he was panicking while under the water, he knew he was drowning and his head was under water.  As a parent I understand that it is my responsibility to watch my kids specially around the pool.  I didn't even think about it twice I jumped in fully clothed with phone in pocked.  I pulled him out of the water and laid him the ground, he was breathing but it took a couple of seconds to take a full breath since he had inhaled water.  Due to my job I am CPR and first aid certified thank goodness I didn't have to perform it on him.  So where was the ""lifeguard"" all this time, to his defense he seemed really young no more than 20 yrs old.  I looked up to see where he was at and this poor kid basically froze he stood in the same place and didn't move a muscle.  My husband was on the other side of the fence yelling at the ""lifeguard"" to open the door but the kid was in shook.  It is safe to assume that being a lifeguard is not his calling.",,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,Jonathan Whitehead,General Manager,2021-07-27,"Thank you for sharing your experience with the TripAdvisor community.  As a parent, I understand incidents such as these can be quite scary.  That is the reason why we provide a Water Safety Rules document to each guest as they enter our aquatics facilities to prevent such incidents in the first place.  It states that our pool attendants are not lifeguards (although they are certified in CPR and First Aid), and that parents are responsible for directly supervising their own children.  I have reviewed the video from that evening that shows that you did move your chair to the edge of the pool to be near your non-swimmer child.  The video shows our attendant had opened the pool gate for your husband to exit and to allow in a hotel employee in with a cart of pool towels.  Your child had stepped off of the shallow end steps and had bobbed in the water for just under two seconds when you became aware and jumped in and then walked with him by your side out of the pool.

The Red Cross recommends that parents should be within arms reach and not distracted by such things as cell phones.  It is also recommended to be in the pool with a non-swimmer youngster.  While we don’t provide swim vests, many parents do bring their own, and we sell inflatable vests and floaties in our Main St. Market gift shop.  I’m glad your child was not injured in this incident, and I hope you otherwise had a delightful stay at Howard Johnson Anaheim.

Coastal797789,3,,2021-07-31,NONE,2021-07-23,5,A really great stay,"We stayed for 3 nights, and loved it. We picked it for a family vacation to Disneyland. We've been fans of another hotel near Disney, but decided to go with the Howard Johnson this time. Favorite parts:
- the staff was wonderful. When the first room we were given had ants, Brittney walked keys to us so we didn't have to return to the front desk. When we needed new towels, and to have our trash taken out, someone arrived within minutes. Every interaction was great. Paula at the front was friendly at check in.
- the room (Building 2) was large, nice, and well appointed. It felt more spacious than the Disney properties, for sure. We had plenty of room to spread out. The bed was comfortable, and there plenty of outlets in the room. Each room has a microwave and a refrigerator. The decor is fun and retro cool, and it's just perfect for a family vacation.
- the pools. Yes, in the time of COVID you have to have reservations. I was able to make them just a few days ahead of our stay. We had a great time at both pools and the staff there was friendly, too.
- walk to the Parks. It's about 10 minutes, tops - so we came back each day for a break. 
- parking. It's free, and plentiful, and the spots are large.

The only things I have to say that were ""negative"" are truly not even worth mentioning: ants in one room, which they took care of immediately. A funny smell coming out of one of the sinks. That's about it. 

I would definitely return and I think it's become my new favorite place to stay when visiting the parks.",,,,,,,,Guest Services,Guest Services / Front Office,2021-08-06,"Thank you so much for taking the time to review your stay with us.

My only complaint is that you are required to reserve a specific window of pool use. This was a considerable inconvenience.

Erica K,37,"Solon, Ohio",2021-07-31,FAMILY,2021-07-19,5,Easy walk to Disney,We were initially supposed to stay here March 2020 for a spring break trip. However Covid changed that. This was the only venue that would not let us cancel and refund us when the pandemic happened. They just gave us credit for a future stay. So we decided to come now that California reopened to everyone. Initially they tried to charge us extra because rates were more now. After speaking with the manager twice they did honor my initial reservation in full. If Covid had not happened I would have had no issues with this hotel. It is in a great location. Just a 15 minute walk to the park. There is a Panera just down the road from it. We would pre-order food every morning to be picked up at 7:10 and grab it on the way to the park. The hotel was very clean and had parking. We did not use the pool as my kids are older and would have rather spent time at the park so I cannot comment on that. If you plan to go to the park on the day you are checking out know that you cannot park your car at the hotel after noon. It will have to be moved but the hotel can tell you where to park that is also close to Disney. Every night you could see the fireworks at Disney from our balcony which was very cool. If you have little kids that sleep early know the fireworks will probably wake them up but I’m thinking that would be the case with any hotel in the vicinity.,,,,,,,,Guest Services,Guest Services / Front Office,2021-08-06,"We greatly appreciate your feedback on your recent stay with us.

Peter L,24,"Clayton, California",2021-07-31,FAMILY,2021-07-14,2,"Hotel is good, location great but Pool rules and regulations ruin the stay","The location of this hotel is fantastic, only minutes walk from Disneyland entrance and a good view of fireworks each night. The rooms are very clean and more than adequate. We had a bunk beds rooms which is perfect for a family of four.  The staff were all excellent and very friendly. So why only two stars?

We booked this hotel because of their excellent pools. 

The pool regulations spoil the entire stay. I don’t know where to start…

- they use an online reservation system which isn’t fit for purpose.  Constant bugs, page fails and login issues (mainly there is no login)
- outdoor pool capacity is limited to 50%
- you require a reservation number to make a pool reservation which doesn’t appear on any of your bookings. After you spend an hour looking and trying the reservation number they give you via email, you then have to call them…and they give you a totally different reservation number. 
- the system asks for a room number which you don’t yet have
- people can make as MANY reservations as they want on the system, which results in a huge number of no shows. 
- you can go to the pool 30 minutes after set times and get a cancellation. 
- at set times they remove everyone from the pool areas, doesn’t matter who is there or who is coming next. You are ejected!  They do this to sanitize the pool area, these pool areas are outdoor and covered in chlorine. 

That list isn’t complete, it really spoils the whole experience of staying there.  

I am all for Covid precautions, but to put this in context five minutes walk away there are 50k people daily mixing in the Disney Parks, indoors and outdoors. Surely outdoor pool facilities are safer that that?",Don’t book while their Covid pool protocols are still in place. As soon as they aren’t this is the perfect place for a family to stay,,,,,,,,,,,47

But this time had a different experience. First they put me in an older building and the rooms were not as fresh and renovated as the newer section.  Second they changed their policy on parking on checkout day. They only let you park until noon which is too inconvenient if you are planning to visit the parks on checkout day.  They used to let you pay $20 to extend the parking.  Not any longer. This totally ruined our DL morning as i had to load up
And drive to Disney parking garage.  The lines were crazy long. it wasted 1.5 hours in the morning and we missed out on valuable ride time as the lines are shorter in the morning.

You are at the right spot, we stayed at the Howard Johnson of Anaheim to give you all the details!

First off, if you have kids, they will have a blast at their Castaway Cove AKA Water Playground galore! And at their large outdoor garden pool (pack your floaties)! When we stayed, we got to see one of the workers that are responsible to disinfect rooms between cleanings, it looks like a Ghostbusters character with their equipment, they make sure everything is squeaky clean. During our stay, masks were mandatory, check with the hotel for updated health-safety policies. 

What we loved?
Family centered, it was perfect for our little family of 4!
Only an 8 minute walk from Disneyland!!!
Tons of restaurant options within an 8 minute walk. However, If you prefer not to walk, the hotel participates in the Anaheim Resort Transportation system, which will take you to and from the Disney parks all day for a small fee.
Free parking! No resort fee, no energy fee!
FUN Water playground for the kids!!!!

The main reason why I booked this hotel was the water playground. The kids had fun at the water playground and the staff at the playground were super nice. My positive experience basically ends here. At night I could hear the freeway traffic and i could feel the ground vibrates every time a bigger car (probably a truck) zoom by the freeway. I could barely sleep. And then we were informed by the staff that our car also has to leave the premise when checking out - this has never happened to us even with other hotels around disneyland. I even asked if I could pay extra to park there for the rest of the day but they said no (and whoever answered my phone, said 'no' ever so coldly.  I was shocked.  On the morning when we checked out, we had to leave with our car.  It was a big disappointment since the whole point of booking a hotel close by is so we could walk into the park (instead of checking out, and park at the Disney garage and walked a mile into the park).  In the past in other hotels we have always been able to leave the car for the day and come back as a hotel guests.  And like I said, I even offered to pay for the day of parking.

My kids love watching YouTube, Netflix and more on the tv while they wait for us to get ready. Tons on plugs to charge devices which makes things so easy. 
There’s a cute store in the lobby of building one that has those little things that you are bound to forget, little snacks and more. 
The rooms are so cute, clean and you can even get bunk beds if you want for the kids. Even though it’s conveniently located right next to I5 it’s so quiet, I have never heard traffic!

Swiftjennifer,30,"Los Angeles, California",2021-06-30,NONE,2021-06-17,5,my first stay and not my last,"i decided to try this hotel because i always stay at the same one. i also wanted to try a hotel that was close enough that i could walk to the parks. i went for my birthday and to finally be back in the disney parks since they reopened. i showed up early in the morning because i wanted to get into the park early. i fully expected to need to check in my luggage and come back later. i was very pleasantly surprised that they had a room ready for me. i believe i did write a note while making the reservation that i would be getting there early too. my room was in the perfect spot (building 3).. close to the front desk and the pool (if i were ever in the mood to swim). the room was clean and had a packet of hand wipes on the nightstand even! the mini fridge was great for keeping my drinks cold. it was nice to have the coffee option but i am very particular about coffee. in the future i wouldn't mind bringing or buying some half half or milk so i can make the coffee. unfortunately i had VERY loud neighbors who didn't care that they woke me up two days in a row but that's no reflection on the hotel itself. they were the only people that were loud, lucky me! all my other neighbors were fine. there's also a bus stop right in front of the hotel so i took the bus for $2 to save myself some steps after walking a TON. from my room it was about a 7-10 min walk to get on disney property. there's a view of the matterhorn from the front of the hotel and if it were operating, a view of the monorail. there are a lot of food options near the hotel too which is great. i love that they have free parking too. that was another reason i wanted to stay here. check out was very easy too. you can do it on the tv and then take off. you don't even need the room key to leave once you've checked out. would definitely stay here again if the price was right!",building 3 is near the front desk,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,,Guest Services,Guest Services / Front Office,2021-06-30,"Thank you for taking the time to let us know about your stay, we greatly appreciate this glowing review!

LingCeee,73,"San Francisco, California",2021-06-30,FAMILY,2021-06-13,5,Awesome hotel,"We only stay here because of the walking distance to Disneyland and the water playground. We came a little bit early and the front desk allowed us to check in. The staffs were helpful throughout our stay. The room was spacious and clean. We love the wallpaper colors as it really matches the theme for Disneyland. We noticed a closet door to the balcony, which was discovered by my son. We stayed in Building 1, which was updated and convenient. We were able to reserve the Castaway Cove and Garden Pool, which was a real breeze. My family and friends had so much fun at the Castaway Cove and pool. We love everything about this hotel and will definitely stay here again on our next Disney visit.",,,,,,,,,,,,54
efamartin,2,"Newport Beach, California",2021-06-30,FAMILY,2021-06-13,3,Average stay. Would consider other options. ,"Best thing about this hotel is the proximity to Disneyland and the waterpark if you have younger kids. We originally booked the kids suite so looking forward to the bunk beds for the kids and a separate room for us parents! Unfortunately due to a plumbing issue we ended up with the family bundle which is basically 2 connected rooms with 2 queen beds each. The hotel has a retro vibe. Rooms are cramped. It was a squeeze to fit a stroller and a crib. There is a mini fridge and microwave. If you want to get into the waterpark, make a reservation in advanced online. Spa requires a reservation once you're in.  They book up fast. Feels like tryinging to get  boarding group for webslingers! You could try going day of to see if there's a spot. In general staff is pleasant and try their best to accommodate. Biggest complaint was the pool reservation process. Front desk and pool staff don't communicate and isn't consistent so because of this the standby process is frustrating. I would recommend the Courtyard Marriott instead...rooms are better and so is the waterpark.

daniellewilliams1185,1,"Simi Valley, California",2021-06-30,NONE,2021-06-09,4,Great Stay - especially for Disneyland goers,"Best part of this hotel is they let you park BEFORE check-in. That might seem like a “well duh” comment but there are hotels in the area that do not allow you to park before the 4 pm check-in, which means (for the Disneyland goers) that you would have to park at Disneyland for the day. The hotel staff was super nice and accommodating. The room was clean and spacious, and the water park area was really fun. I am very thankful to the hotel staff for making my son’s first Disneyland trip so great. I wish they would let you park after 12 pm on the checkout day though. I even asked if I could park till just 1 pm since we had tickets to Disney for the following day as well and just wanted to do a half day and they said no which I thought was disappointing considering I was going to check out of the room but just use the parking spot for an hour longer, which is the ONLY reason I’m doing 4 stars instead of 5. All in all, it was a great stay and I am happy they let you park there so early. Also, they didn’t charge for parking. Walk to the park was between 5-10 minutes (quicker than the tram from the parking lot and much more convenient with a stroller).

It was a nice walk to the park with places to eat on the way. The room was clean and spacious for our group of 5 and there was plenty of room to set up the pack n play for my son to sleep in. I loved all the counter space to put our things on. I read about skylights in some rooms being an issue for kids to nap so I made sure to ask about it. Our room was pitch black with the blackout curtains. 

I must give a shout out to all the staff. Everyone from check-in to the staff working at the pool and water park were so friendly, helpful and accommodating. We were initially given a room that was too far of a walk for my elderly mom. I called the front desk and we were switched right away to a room on the first floor close to the entrance. The staff member at the pool helped us make a reservation right there on her tablet. Only complaint would be that the beds were a little too high to comfortably climb onto especially with an infant in my arms but the beds were so comfortable it made up for it.

The pool and water playground reservations were easy and kept the areas from getting over crowded.  The walk to the gates of Disney is super easy.

Rooms were clean. Everyone we encountered was friendly.   My only complaint is the bunk bed, the top bed is so close to the bottom that you can sit on that one and the way the ladder is it's hard for my kid to swing her leg up and onto the bed.",,,,,,,,Guest Services,Guest Services / Front Office,2021-06-07,"Thank you for taking the time to review your recent stay with us!

Mnristy,2,"Norfolk, Virginia",2021-05-31,FAMILY,2021-06-01,4,Great hotel..,"Just stayed here this past weekend and enjoyed this hotel. It’s walking distance to the Disneyland park entrance. Rooms were themed with Mickey which made it feel like we were staying at a Disneyland hotel. They had a nice water park for the kids. Also having the store downstairs was extremely nice to be able to grab things we accidentally forgot at home. Only thing we didn’t like was the cleaning of our room. They have these express clean door hangers that state if you put them on your door before 9am your room is guaranteed to be cleaned. Well the first morning we went to the parks we didn’t need our room cleaned just needed the trash picked up which we had to call and request when we got back that night. The next day we put the hanger on the door and was gone before 8am. We came back exhausted around 7:30 to our room still dirty with trash and no clean towels. We could’ve called again for these requests but due to being wore out we didn’t feel like dealing with it which is why we put the hanger on the door in the first place so we could come back to our room and be comfortable. 

Besides that we enjoyed the hotel and the free parking.

Disneyland marquee, and Howard Johnson’s. You could see HoJo’s from the Skyway, the PeopleMover, and of course the Monorail. I always thought it would be bitchen to stay there.My parents could only afford to go to Disneyland once every couple years. Now that I’m an old fart,and 
can afford to be a kid, I am one! Love the architecture and the cool’60’s vibe. Really dig the bitchen art by Shag too!

Unfortunately, I had an issue with my experience at the Castaway Cove Pool.  I reserved the first time slot jacuzzi reservation and during my time in the jacuzzi a man and his child came in the jacuzzi when they did not have a reservation.  The man acted like he did not know the procedures even though we were all told the procedures when we arrived.  The pool attendant saw them in the jacuzzi with me and did not question him as she wrongly assumed he was with me which she should not have done.  I did not feel safe talking to the gentleman about it myself and I did not feel safe in the jacuzzi or the Castaway Cove.  I left Castaway Cove immediately after my jacuzzi time as my experience was ruined.  Two attendants at the Castaway Cove is not nearly enough!  Kerri at the garden pool was amazing, very professional and very fun to talk to!  I also found the internet connection was not adequate in my room on the first level of building two.  I had a housekeeping issue as well.  Nothing too major but worth mentioning upon check out.  I let Rick the front desk supervisor know about my concerns and he made things right which I very much appreciate!

The room was very spacious, comfortable beds, a large bathroom and we had a view of fireworks at night. This particular room was renovated last year and I loved the retro theme. The size of the room is quite nice and you don’t feel cramped at all, even with your luggage and others in the room. We loved the patio that overlooked across to Disneyland. We could see the Matterhorn, Space Mountain, parts of the castle and watch the monorail go by. We could even hear the train whistle and bell! The only thing I would suggest is possibly turning off the water fountains at Castaway Cove during the fireworks bc then we could hear the firework music from Disneyland while we watched! It’s a quick 8-minute walk to Disneyland from the hotel which is very convenient. I highly recommend this hotel, especially for families bc they also have the small water park, Castaway Cove. Some of their rooms have bunk beds and a Pirates of the Caribbean theme! There is also a game room, market and gift store with lots of Disney items to buy.

Kate A,2,"Manawatu-Wanganui Region, New Zealand",2020-01-31,NONE,2020-03-11,5,Great stay - so close to Disney!,"Arrived after a long flight, and a drive from LAX in peak traffic hour so I was super sleep deprived! Check in was easy, staff were really nice and I got a room upgrade so good! Room was tidy, bed was comfy and the bathroom was clean. I think the cleaners are used to everybody going to Disneyland relatively early, so if you're like me and like a wee sleep in (and watch some Netflix in the morn while getting ready) then don't forget to put the 'do not disturb' sign out like I did! My room was very quiet (I am a light sleeper too!) considering it was on the highway side (building one I think) and had a big glass window so I could check out the hazy LA sunrise - pretty cool! Bus stop for my Universal Studios coach was literally right outside the hotel so that was awesome. Disneyland is super close, and there is a McDonalds nearby too so that was great for a cheap brekky on the way to Disney. A walk further down the road and there is pharmacies and other shops, so easy to grab everything. Staff were helpful, they held my bags for me on the last day and let me hang around until my airport shuttle came to collect me.

This hotel is close to Disney and easy walking distance. They have parking for hotel guests that is like $10 a day. 

There are closer hotels and we really wished we would have stayed in one of those. 

We got this hotel through a Wyndham rewards program. If we went to a timeshare presentation then we got a greatly reduced price. The greatly reduced price is the only thing that made this hotel worth it. ... and after the presentation and the horrible way were treated by the timeshare people....we questioned if the reduced price was worth it at all?! HORRIBLE, but that's not this hotel's fault, so... back to the review!!

This hotel has amazing grounds. It is an older hotel they are working on renovating. 

It is a fairly quiet hotel. We could hear our upstairs neighbors each morning. Enough that it woke us both up, so we just got up and got ready and left for the day. But we didn't hear outside noise or neighboring rooms TV noises. 

We were given an ADA room. 

The room was updated, but not the bathroom. The bathroom was very plain and quite frankly ugly. The bathroom could use some updating and still be ADA compliant. 

The building we were in smelled very musty and stinky. It actually smelled like a nursing home and of stale urine. Enough that we went and bought air fresheners for the room because the odor was so strong. 

The rooms have refrigerators, microwaves and Keurig coffee makers in the rooms. 

The bed was ok. It was hard and lumpy, but we were so tired we just went to sleep. The sheets were soft though, which was a plus. 

Now, one thing this hotel has is really great customer service. We were there over Valentines day and they put a little Valentines candy in our room with a card. That was a nice touch. 

The rooms appeared to be clean, but we just could not get over the smell. 

The rooms all had a nice little patio on them and from our patio you could see some fo the Disney fireworks. 

There is a very awesome pool and play area. We did not use it, but if you have kids this area would be great!!

This hotel could be great, but it was just not our cup of tea...if you will!!

We would not stay here if we ever come back to Disneyland. There are plenty of other hotels to choose from and we really wish we would have chosen better.",ask for a fireworks view room,,5.0,,,3.0,3.0,HojoAnaheimStaff,Reservationist ,2020-03-16,"Thank you for taking the time to review your stay with us. We are so sorry to hear that the Wyndham Time Share staff was disrespectful to you and your family. As this should have never happened to being with, we are sincerely sorry in the way that they treated you. We recommend, when using Wyndham benefits, it is a lot easier to book directly through the hotel that you are staying at and using your Wyndham points towards free stays. 

We are sorry to hear about the parking situation. Our parking is free on our property so you definitely should not have been charged per day. The only time we charge is if you have more than one vehicle with your reservation, then it is a $20.00 + 17% charge per day. 

We also apologize for the bad odor in your room. Was this mentioned to our Front Desk Staff after entering the room? If so, we are sorry to see that no further adjustments were made to try and get you and your family to another room accommodation. 

It is great to hear that our staff was amazing in assisting you to during your stay. 

We apologize that your beds were uncomfortable for you but it's great to hear that in exchange the sheets were soft. 

We appreciate you taking the time to review your stay at our hotel. We are sorry to hear that you are not interested in staying with us again but maybe after we finish renovating all of our buildings you will give us another try. :)

Gaozua L,1,,2020-02-29,NONE,2020-02-19,3,"Average stay, poor communication.","The furniture and the bathrooms are a bit outdated but the rooms were comfy enough. I really liked the patio where we could open the door for nice fresh air. Quick walk to Disneyland with restaurants along the way and close by.

On the second morning of our three night stay, my husband and I awoke to very loud commotions occurring right outside our door. After about 20 minutes of doors opening and closing, people talking and giving orders, the vacuum came on. This was at 6 in the morning, after a very long day and night at Disneyland. You can imagine how frustrated we were. After another 20 minutes, my husband called the front desk to inquire about the disturbance in which he was told that a pipe had bursted. They said there was nothing they could do and they would let the manager know that we were one of the rooms that was affected. I am not sure that means but nothing was done about it. The water was shut off so our family (10 years old, 9 years old, and 8 years old) used our drinking water to wash our faces and brush our teeth. Not even kidding! There was a machine right outside our door with the extension cord crossing our door. My sister next door was not happy at all, as all the noise woke her children up, 2 and 1 year olds. She was told the same thing. The vacuuming and people going in and out of the hallway continued throughout the entire day with no contact from the manager. When we returned from our day, we had to use the other entrance and exit because the one we used was blocked off with fans. This was a very unexpected and unfortunate situation. However, we were left to ourselves with no concerns from the front desk. I guess our room did not flood, therefore we were not affected enough. The way the situation was handled, or not handled, was very disappointing.",Some rooms are old and need upgrading.,,3.0,,4.0,2.0,,HojoAnaheimStaff,Reservationist ,2020-02-20,"Yay! We are so happy to hear that your room was comfy and that you got to enjoy some fresh air from the balcony of your room. :) 

We are so sorry about the inconvenience of the pipe bursting. On the morning of 2/19 we did have an unexpected water pipe burst under the flooring in one of our Pavilion Buildings. We can definitely relate to the disappointment as this was not expected to us as well as our guests. We apologize that this happened to your family during your vacation, as we would never wish for that to happen to any of our guests. Due to the fact that the water pipe burst under the concrete and the entire building, we had to vacuum out the water from the carpet as quickly as possible before the flooring molded. This is correct, not all rooms were affected by the water pipe burst but unfortunately since it did happen under the building, which has one water pipe to supply water for the entire building, we had to turn off the water so that no further issues occurred on the second floor or in the walls of the building. Our Front Desk staff did notify every guest and left voicemails in each room regarding the water shut off. We apologize again for the inconvenience as this was not planned. 

Thank you for reviewing your stay with us and we hope to see you again in the future.

JESSICA D,3,"Lincoln, California",2020-02-29,NONE,2020-02-19,3,Clean and good customer service but seriously underwhelming,"We stayed at this hotel for a 4 day trip to Disney. I had read good reviews and was looking forward to our stay. Unfortunately we chose to stay in one of the not-yet-renovated rooms in Building 4. The entire building smelled so old...including our room. We were given a room facing the kiddie pool area which normally I would appreciate but the pool area was VERY LOUD. Between the music and the giant water feature dumping water all day, we couldn't hear ourselves think. The older rooms also have these giant sunlight features that do not have covers of any sort so if you want to keep your room dark there is no way to do it. The internet connection was fine. We got errors when trying to connect occasionally but eventually were on the Wi-fi. Also the adult pool was closed and the kiddie area was just too ""young"" for my teenagers so they had no options in that department.

That being said the customer service was great, the parking lot was huge (+free parking is great) and the walk to Disney to was fast and easy. I'm not sure I would stay in the unrenovated rooms again though",Stay in a renovated room!

The pool is more of a splash pool. This and the slides which were open up till 9pm even though the weather wasn’t warm. There is a hot tub to warm up in. There’s a small shop on site which we used. Our only issue was we were delayed flying home and after checking on Bookings.com to see they weren’t fully booked, tried to book one more night and we told by reception they were fully booked and then they rang back and said they could offer a room, I felt like they were trying to charge us more as if they were doing us a favour and we didn’t have a choice but we did so we moved hotels for our last night, shame to end a stay like this.

The staff was very helpful! We stayed in a premium room in building one with a view of Disneyland! The room was very nice. The only negative to our whole trip was that our BOB duallie double stroller could only fit through the room door when folded. I plan on asking if handicap rooms are accessible next time to see if our double stroller could fit through those doors. It was hard packing and unpacking our stroller in the hallway every morning and night. We didn’t use the water playground at all but only because we spent every waking minute in Disneyland :) We really enjoyed our stay at the HOJO! ,,,,,,,,HojoAnaheimStaff,Reservationist,2020-02-13,"Yay!

bkleiger,1,,2020-02-29,NONE,2020-02-10,5,"Clean, comfortable, and extremely family friendly.","We stayed in one of the newly renovated Premium Rooms in Building 1 with two queen beds and a view of the Disney fireworks. Renovations on building 2 just started, and soon building 3! This is the ultimate family hotel. 
Upon arriving as we walked into the lobby there were chocolate gold coins, pixie sticks, and sword shaped balloons for the kiddos. 
What stood out to us most:
Castaway Cove- This water playground was so much fun. There are slides, water cannons, slides, oh and a 200 gallon drench bucket. Did I mention this is also pirate themed? The kids actually asked to leave the mouse house to hit up the water park on the hotel property. 
On Property Store: This little shop on the bottom of building 1 was more of a we have it if you forgot it, and we have it if you didn’t know you needed it kinda store. From snacks and drinks, to art supplies they had it ALL literally downstairs from the room. 
Smart rooms- I mean, a room with an Alexa, free Wifi, electronic safe, and a charging station with two plugs and two USB ports on the desk. When you need charged all the things (iPads, phones, watches) plugs become a hot commodity! Oh, and did I mention the television was smart too. The boys were able to watch Netflix in our downtime without having to hunt for cartoons on those wonky hotel TV channels. I know you know what I’m talking about. 
Microwave- for you mamas, you know how finicky and hungry the kiddos can get in the morning or before bed. Having a microwave in the room makes it a lot easier to heat up a little breakfast or milk for the little ones before bed. They also provide a fridge and Keurig in all rooms. 
Double vanity sinks- I never really thought about this until I was able to get ready in the morning and not having to fight over a sink with the hubby. Gamechanger!",,,,,,,,HojoAnaheimStaff,Reservationist,2020-02-13,"Wow! This is amazing. We appreciate all of the kind and loving words you said about our hotel!

Under our website it is listed that the Garden Pool is shut down until April of 2020 due to renovations, we are sorry that you were not aware of this prior to your arrival. 

We are so sorry to hear that your room was smaller. Depending on the specific room type, some rooms are smaller than others but the room itself is not smaller just because of the elevator being next to the room. 

We hope his information was helpful when booking your next vacation to Anaheim.

Araceli_559,121,"Madera, California",2020-01-31,NONE,2020-01-14,2,Dissapointment,"I booked this hotel from a Wyndham discounted offer for 3 days and 2 nights. In exchange, we had to attend a 2hr time share sales presentation through Wyndham. We travel often and have stayed in various different hotels throughout California. Our experience at this hotel was below average. We stayed in a room with 2 full beds, although we were promised 2 queen beds. The room was small, super outdated, smelled old and musky, and did not offer a free breakfast. Even the linen had an old, musky smell to it. The only real positive benefit about this hotel is its close proximity to Disneyland. It is a short 7min walk. The overall hotel layout was a bit strange to me as well. Due to the weather, we did not have the luxury of visiting their water park. Overall, I was dissapointed and would think twice about staying here. I also did not appreciate the fact that they were rushing us out of our room while we were at another hotel doing the presentation. We had to call three different times to extend our time, and at one point housekeeping went to the room and scared our 2 daughters we had left in the room while we did the presentation. The front desk staff, however, were friendly and courteous, so I did appreciate that. Beware of the timeshare presentation sales people.

Karina M,28,"Seattle, Washington",2019-12-31,FAMILY,2020-01-07,5,Loved it,"Stayed here for 3 nights and absolutely loved it! The room set up was incredible for us and the kids. We opted for the smaller room with bunk beds and it was PERFECT! Not to mention the little additions for the kids like the stool in the bathroom and the little take home rubber ducky for their baths. It was beyond spotless! So clean. And the cleaners putting the change our kids were collecting in mickey mouse formation. It was super close to disneyland also which was awesome. We walked to the park in 5 mins and even after a long day at the park, our 4 and 6 year olds had no issues walking back. Tons of restaurants close by as well :) we unfortunately weren’t able to try out the waterpark located at the hotel, but it looked amazing. We also were able to watch the disney fireworks from the hotel which was also a really cool thing to see when not needing to stay at the park to see them since they were on late and the kiddos needed to be ready for bed. All in all, all 4 of us voted we would DEFINITELY be back there on our next trip to Anaheim.

misslassie,227,"Brisbane, Australia",2019-11-30,FAMILY,2020-01-07,5,Disney Magic ,"I thoroughly researched just about every hotel on Harbour Bv before I booked the HoJo and I was so nervous leading up to this trip hoping that I had made the right decision. My family have stayed in a lot of hotels and of course I wanted our first Disneyland trip to be absolutely perfect. Thankfully we were delighted with our 4 night stay at the HoJo. Check in was friendly but brief which was what we needed after a long drive. We had reserved a room in Building 1 with a Disneyland view (and paid a little extra for it) and we were very pleased with it. It was spotlessly clean, modern, spacious with a gorgeous view across to the monorail and the Matterhorn! I loved the vintage Disney touches in the artworks. The blinds were excellent and blocked out the light to pitch darkness which was great for afternoon naps for the kids. Housekeeping knocked on our door a few times the first afternoon during naptime so we quickly found the do not disturb hanger and this didn’t happen again. We’re pretty quick walkers and found it only took us 7 minutes to get to the Disneyland gates- a very easy walk even with two small kids. We visited Castaway Cove - the splash zone- one afternoon and the kids loved it. I particularly liked that Building 1 has internal stairwells so I felt it was a bit more secure than some of the older motel style properties. I was always super keen to get up and going in the mornings, and it was great to be able to get ready in the well lit bathroom as the kids slept a little longer. The coffee machine was a great asset too, as well as the fridge that we stocked up with snacks. Because reception was in a separate building we didn’t really get to interact with the staff too much- check out was similarly brief. Parking on site was easy and free. I would happily stay here again and will certainly be recommending the HoJo to friends planning their Disneyland holidays!",,,,,,,,HojoAnaheimStaff,Reservationist,2020-01-08,"Thank you for reviewing your most recent stay with us.

CarolenaCampbell,94,"Medford, Oregon",2019-12-31,FAMILY,2020-01-03,4,Overall good with a bit of a room disappointment ,"While the location was excellent, and the service we received was also great, our room was a bit disappointing. We were in the main building to the right of the front office. We were placed in a room that was set back from the hall and therefore much smaller. We only had two adults and a toddler, yet we were constantly tripping over each other. Very, very small room. The bathroom had hardly any counter space. The balcony access was through the closet, which was incredibly strange. The bed was fairly uncomfortable- very firm and my husband and I woke up with aching backs. 
We did love the location, service, and cleanliness of the room and hotel. Didn’t use the pool because it wasn’t pool weather for us, but it looked awesome. 
**The photo was taken from the corner with my back all the way too the window and the bunk bed was the cut off of the room where the entry was. ",,,,,,,,HojoAnaheimStaff,Reservationist,2020-01-07,"Thank you for reviewing your most recent stay with us. We are so sorry to hear that the room was small and the beds were uncomfortable for you and your husband. We do offer larger rooms on our property,  such as our Kids Suite room, that are bigger than our Two Queen Deluxe rooms and have a separate King Bed room. 

We do apologize for the inconvenience of the sliding door being placed in the closet. All of our rooms, that face the City View of our property, have balcony access through the closet because we double pane the sliding glass doors to block out excess freeway noise. In order to do so, the only way to make the freeway noise almost impossible to hear, was by extending the balcony enough so that all of our guests still have balcony space and by extending we then had to place the door inside of the closet.

Jjdk19,17,,2019-12-31,NONE,2019-12-22,5,Excellent choice for comfort and proximity to Disneyland,"We enjoyed our recent stay at the HoJo during our Disneyland Trip. The best thing about this hotel is the proximity to Disneyland, it's 10 mins walking (or less) to the main entrance. As far as the hotel itself, we stayed in the newly renovated building with a room that looked out towards Disneyland. The hotel was festively decorated for the winter holidays. We were told we would have an excellent view of the nightly fireworks show, and this was definitely the case when we were awoken on our first night (we went to bed early due to be ready to go first thing in the morning!) by the beautiful fireworks display that we could see clearly from our balcony. The room was comfortable, clean, and spacious. We had 2 queen beds and a small dining table with a bench which was especially convenient for us and our 2 young children to sit at to eat lunch and dinner. The TV's all come with access to HBO GO (for free) and the ability to sign in to your netflix account. The bathroom was clean and had all necessary toiletries, plenty of towels, and a nice shower. 
There are plenty or food options nearby, including a McDonald's, Panera Bread, and Mimi's Cafe across the street. This is especially important because the HoJo does not have breakfast, but there are Keurig's in the rooms as well as microwaves and mini fridges. One huge perk is that parking is free at the hotel! Many of the surrounding hotels do not offer free parking and charge upwards of $30/day. Having free parking was great for us since we opted for a rental car in order to get to HoJo from the airport with our kids' car seats and to do some practical shopping (Costco and Walmart are nearby and great for grabbing necessities you'll need in the park), rather than take a ride sharing service.",,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,,HojoAnaheimStaff,Reservationist,2019-12-23,"Thank you for reviewing your most recent stay with us!

They explained where all of the amenities on the property were, parking, how to get to the parks, where to eat close by, etc.  The walk to the gates of Disneyland and DCA is about 10-20 minutes depending on how many short stubby-legged toddlers you have to herd along the sidewalk with you. By myself though, I made it from my room to the Parks in about 10 minutes. 
Our room was really what made this hotel great! We stayed in Building 1 in the Two-Bedroom Family Suite that included 1 King Bed, 1 Bunk Bed, and a sleeper sofa. There were only 3 of us, so this room was much bigger than what we needed, but it was nice to have the space regardless. There were 2 bathrooms in this room as well, which made getting ready in the morning a breeze. They included a small rubber ducky bath toy that my son was pretty thrilled with as well. 
The room itself was quiet and well furnished. They are definitely going for a retro vibe here, so most of the décor fit that motif. They had amazing Pirates of the Caribbean wall decorations which I absolutely loved though!  The King bed was soft and the bunk beds seemed pretty comfortable and sturdy too.
There is a waterpark on this property, but since it was raining so heavily, and we were at the Parks all day, we didn’t get to enjoy it while we were there. The pool they have was closed because of the property renovations and constructions, but again we probably would not have made it over there on this visit anyhow. 
The gift/convenience store is open fairly late and they had everything I was looking for when I went down for late night snacks.  
Overall, our stay here was as close to perfect as I could have hoped for, though there were a few things I noticed that may be of concern to other guests of this hotel. While the rooms are non-smoking there is a smoking area out behind building 1, next to the big orange HoJo chairs. I didn’t mind it, but I know that it is a concern sometimes. I am not sure you would be able to smell the smoke from the rooms or not though. 
There was also this loud, rather obnoxious bell (more like a squeaking really) going off in the waterpark around 9:30pm. We noticed it as we were walking back from the park. It didn’t go on and off, but just remained steadily on the entire time we stood out front looking for our room key.

blondroxychic,2,,2019-12-31,FRIENDS,2019-12-18,3,"Nice room, could have some improvements","The ice and vending machine in the room and building I stayed in were out of order, so we had to walk to one of the other buildings to get anything after the gift shop was closed. The vending machine only offered water in each of the 6 slots. When we got to the room, we couldn't find the facial tissue anywhere. Called the front desk who said it should be on the desk under the TV or in the bathroom. We ended up eventually finding it in the closet (weird place for it). Also, when we arrived, one of the coffee pods had already been punched in with the Keurig, but it was not used. It was placed back in the coffee rack and coffee grounds were spilled all over the coffee rack. Other than that, the room was fine. The rubber duckies they give to take home were a cute touch. The room I got said ""park view"" but there were a number of giant trees, so it was a park view ish.

thebrewerss,7,,2019-12-31,COUPLES,2019-12-12,5,Wonderful experience,"We have just checked out from the most wonderful stay at the Hojo. 

THE ROOM 
We got upgraded to one of the beautiful remodelled rooms in building one. We had two double beds. The room had a lovely bright decor with a sweet table setting for breakfasts and lunches. The room had a view of Disney and the castaway cove area. We have not stayed in the other room types this was our first stay at this hotel but we would definitely recommend it. 

It was kept very very clean by the cleaning staff. 

THE LOCATION 
The location was amazing and we found it amazing to be able to avoid the shuttles and walk to and from the park each day and it was so quick. 

THE STAFF 
We found the staff that we interacted with were very nice and helpful. We especially appreciated Rick and Samantha who checked us in and out. The hotel was extremely accomodating allowing us to arrive well before the 4pm check in and gave us an upgraded room detailed above. 

OTHER TIPS: 
The rooms have both a microwave and a mini fridge which makes it easy to cut the cost of dining. We ordered groceries and had them delivered to the hotel there is also a short Walmart. The gift shop also has a number of snacks, cereals, basics like bread, butter and milk. This meant we cut the costs of breakfast and lunch by making it in the room. 

We also recommend Mimi’s across the street for an easy family restaurant experience. The map the hotel gives you has a good coupon in it.

We enjoyed it so much we are planning another trip.",,,,,,,,HojoAnaheimStaff,Reservationist,2019-12-13,"Thank you so much for taking the time to review your recent stay with us. Wow! We are so happy to see all of these amazing comments about our hotel.

RoJay2028,1,"Vacaville, California",2019-12-31,FAMILY,2019-12-11,4,Usually our favorite hotel while at Disneyland,"We go to Disneyland every other month and we love staying at this hotel. The front desk is amazing and always so helpful. The housekeeping is wonderful and very friendly. The rooms are spacious and always immaculately clean. Our family absolutely loves this hotel. However, this last stay we had an issue with staff on the water playground that left a bad taste in our mouth. The main reason we stay at this hotel is for the water park. My four kids love being out there rain or shine. Our youngest child is slightly autistic and has speech delays. She doesn't like the feel of swimwear, so she normally wears a shirt and a swim diaper to the pool. Prior to taking her to the water playground we checked with staff at the front desk to assure this would be acceptable, and also fully read the rules of the playground which stated younger children must have a swim diaper or plastic pants. We were assured that her swim diaper and a shirt was acceptable and she would have no issues. However, when took the baby to the water playground the next afternoon, we were approached by the water playground attendant about 10-15 minutes after the baby had gotten in the water and started playing and informed me that my child was not wearing proper swimwear and we would need to leave the water playground and go to the front desk or gift shop to obtain plastic pants for the child. We informed the staff member that the front desk assured us that the baby's outfit was acceptable, but I ended up having to pull my child out of the water screaming, kicking, crying, wrap her in a towel, and take her to the front office full of people dripping wet and screaming bloody murder to get a pair of plastic pants that looks similar to a grocery bag. We put the plastic pants on the baby who continued to pull them off or it would get filled with water and fall off. We eventually just left and let the baby play in the bathtub instead. It was a very disheartening experience, especially since we checked multiple times before entering the water park to assure we wouldn't have any issues. Our family already has 2 future trips and multiple rooms booked with this hotel for next year, but after our experience we will most likely cancel and book rooms with the Courtyard Marriott across the street. We stayed with them over the summer, as the HoJo was fully booked, and the staff at the Marriott where very friendly, helpful, and accommodating with our child's circumstances.",,,,,,,,HojoAnaheimStaff,Reservationist,2019-12-12,"Thank you for taking the time to review your most recent stay with us! We are so sorry to hear that our staff did not give you the correct information needed before entering the Waterpark & Playground area. As we do train all of our staff to follow specific procedures, we will make sure to speak with our Front Desk Management Team regarding this miscommunication. 

We are so happy to see that you and your family are repeating guests here at Howard Johnsons. As we hand out the Waterpark Rules upon check-in, with the orange wristbands, we also ask our Front Desk Team to inform all of our guests with children in diapers that they must wear a plastic swim diaper on top of the regular swim diaper. We do enforce this rule as much as possible, as it is not labeled in our Waterpark Rules sheet, to prevent Code Browns (stool in the water) which lead to pool closures. 

We hope to have you and your family back at our hotel to provide excellent service during your next vacation here at our Waterpark & Playground area.

I don’t know about the rest of the place, but the building we were in had no elevator and very dated rooms. The bathroom had a commercial-style bar flush handle toilet and was very uncomfortably situated. The air/heating system was loud and slow to engage. The rollaway bed cost and additional $15 per night, which wasn’t disclosed when the room was booked, but since we had five people staying, we didn’t have an option but to use it.

These shuttles pick up guests that would like to be taken to the entrance of Disneyland, or brought back to the hotel, for a charge of $6.00 per adult and $2.50 per child ages 3-9. 

We truly apologize for the lack of communication about the additional charge for the Rollaway Bed. We train all our staff members to inform our guests about the charge, but if our staff fails to do so, there is also an orange tag placed on all of the Rollaway Beds that states the additional fee of usage as well as a sign that is placed behind all of our room doors. 

We have big changes approaching our hotel in April of 2020 and will be sure to share your comments with our management team. At the moment we are currently renovating our Building 2 in the back of our property as well as our Garden Pool. Once these rooms are open in the Spring we will have a lot more options open to all of our guests. We hope you decide to give us another try and allow us the opportunity to serve you better. ",27

Only a sheet on the bed.... my husband was cold for several nights until he finally went to front desk and picked up another blanket.He tried to adjusted the air conditioning but made no difference.
They should be embarrassed about there free toiletries in the bathroom and the seriously hard water. You could cut yourself on the bar of soap.
Called front desk several times for these various complaints..... and no one would answer.

They do not have elevators so if you are traveling with kids you have to carrier a stroller up and down steep stairs. They also had some weird windows in the ceiling area so it wasn’t great if you need it to be dark for kids naps. They also don’t have the grounds well lit so you are walking in the dark at night which doesn’t seem very safe.

Climber600542,1,"Seattle, Washington",2019-11-30,COUPLES,2019-11-23,5,Disney Trip with Broken Foot,"Husband and I booked a short get-a-away to Disneyland and decided to give HoJo a try. Had heard how close in proximity to Disneyland they were. They are ""right across the street"" but there is still about 2 blocks to walk before crossing the street to the gates of Disneyland. They are across the street from the Matterhorn and Monorail. I suspect you can see the fireworks if you have a room high enough, which ours was not and we were always in the park when they went off.

We checked in at about 1:30pm and surprisingly, there was a room available on the first floor that was ready for us (4109, I think). I was using a knee scooter due to a foot injury and needed either and elevator-accessible floor (they didn't have rooms ready yet) or one on the first floor, which they did have.

The room we booked was a double queen room. We were right next to the water park. And I mean right...next...to...the...pool! You could literally jump in the hot tub from our balcony if desired. The music from the pool was definitely audible in the room, but we weren't going to be in the room for more than a few minutes until we changed and headed to the park. But if you were a family that had young kids that needed a quiet room for nap time, this would not be a good room for that. But if you had older kids that were into the waterpark...this was definitely the room to be in! 

The room was very large. It had a twin roll-away bed in an alcove so would sleep 5 very comfortably with room to spare. It had a sink outside the bathroom and one in the bathroom, which made getting ready in the morning easier. A microwave, coffee maker (pod-maker), and mini-fridge could definitely help make breakfast/meal costs a little easier on the wallet if one needed. We opted to eat at the restaurants that were along the walk to Disneyland each morning.

My only issues with the property are that the registration building isn't very clearly marked (our Lyft driver had a little difficulty trying to find the office) and is quite small inside; and that the furniture in our room is quite dated. It would have been nice to have USB plug-ins for our devices at least somewhere in the room. And updating the locks on the doors would make one feel safer. If we had stayed longer, I might have wanted to use the ""quiet"" pool but it was not available due to construction 
But all in all, we definitely would stay there again and would bring our teen boys with us (and maybe even all stay in the same room!",Bring power blocks for your devices as there are no USB plug-ins (at least in building 4).,,,,,,,HojoAnaheimStaff,Reservationist ,2019-11-27,Thank you for reviewing your stay with us! We are so delighted to hear that you and your family really enjoyed our large rooms. We are so sorry to hear that the walk was a little further than you had expected but are ecstatic to hear that you loved the 2 sinks inside of the room to make your morning a lot easier.

Its location is 5 minutes from the gates of Disneyland, there are plenty of food choices nearby, public transit is nearby and pricing was good (can't compare to others though).  Staff were fantastic, rooms were clean and the splash pool/hot tub was great.  Unfortunately, the pool was not open (due to refurbishment) and we expected it to be.  Hotel said they notified everyone or their vacation suppliers about it.  After speaking to many guests about it, no one seemed to be told about it. The hotel kindly upgraded us to a family room at no extra cost halfway through our stay due to the lack of the pool. The family room was renovated and very pleasant. We were told all the family rooms back onto the busy road (5 lanes wide each way) so there is some road noise (low hum) BUT the hotel has done an amazing job with sound proofing it the best they can. We only noticed traffic at the quietest time of the night. Suggestions before going: 1) if pool is important - make sure it is open! 2) Consider asking for a room not backing onto the highway if you are a light sleeper.

Lisa457,15,,2019-11-30,FAMILY,2019-11-15,4,Disneyland getaway,"Just returned from our 4 night Disney trip with our 5 year old grandson. We chose the Hojo based on a past trip, albeit 11 years ago, the water park, and the easy walk to Disneyland. 
This is an older hotel, which is in the process of being renovated. We were in Building 4, which has not been upgraded. Very retro! It was very clean and more than adequate for the short amounts of time we spent in it. We knew the beds were doubles, which is unfortunate, but it was okay for a few nights. Our room overlooked the water park, which was thrilling for our grandson. We didn't mind the extra noise. Again, we were not in the room too often. Only real complaint was the shower head being at shoulder height. I'm sure this will be remedied upon renovating.
The staff, from check in, to the housekeepers, to the store, to the groundskeepers, were very pleasant. Always friendly. 
The water park was fun for our grandson. We took a Disney break on 2 afternoons and he rested and then played in the park for an hour. 
Mimi's restaurant across the street if you want a sit down meal, McDonalds and Panera Bread very close for something faster, as well as tons of other eateries within a short walk. Keurig, microwave, and mini fridge in the room. Beer and wine in the store! 7 minutes from the hotel to the first security gate at Disneyland.

Glenn Hampson,7,,2019-11-30,FAMILY,2019-11-11,5,Adore This Place ,"I decided to stay here despite my nervousness with bad hotel bookings in the past and because of this being a big deal Disney trip coming from Australia and having spent a lot of money travelling across the USA on a bucket list trip.
From booking,to communication online prior to trip,to check in,to amenities to cleanliness it checked every box easily.This is a big deal given how fussy I am and this place has been a pure joy to stay at.
Staff have been so friendly and accommodating, housekeepings attention to detail wonderful, the rooms spacious and with the retro vibe they are very hip and superb looking rooms.
With barely a 10 minute walk to the DisneyLand entrance off Harbour Boulevard,shuttle bookings available,mobility scooter bookings available,park facing balcony views if you want them to see the monorail go by or the fireworks at night,as well as a huge selection of food options along the strip everything here is catered for adequately.
The downstairs gift shop have Disney merch,supplies such as candy soda and staples as well as postcards and the like and is open most of the day.
It has a great family vibe.My kids 10,13 and 15 loved the water park on premises when not at Disney and it felt like a home away from home.
We got here as Christmas Celebrations in the park were taking place and they decked the hotel at Hojo out too with their large Christmas Tree decorated full of bling and elves running around.
I will be singing the praises of this place to everyone back home in Australia for its affordability and comfortable stay.
Do yourself a favour and try Hojo you will not be disappointed for your next Disney stay.
I haven’t stopped smiling it has been a joy and just added to the memory of our trip

KIRSTY,17,"Sydney, Australia",2019-10-31,NONE,2019-11-05,3,"Where was the lounge or additional bedding? Oh, that will cost you!","We area family of four (ages 7, 11, and 39 x 2). The booking was for us four (4) with two double beds and a lounge. The theory being, that our seven year old may well end up sleeping on the lounge - which were told was fine. Upon arrival, we were greeted by two double beds and a 'dinner table' kind of set up. In the cupboard, was a roll-away bed. This roll-away bed, we thought was the trade off for there being no lounge. We wheeled the bed out to find a tag attached with ""$17 USD"" per night, attached. Being dumb, we thought that it was nothing, until suddenly my credit card was charged accordingly for the ""extra bed rental"". So, for ten days - we got another $17 ($25 AUD) charged - $250 despite being advised of other options. There is no way I was letting the seven year old sleep on the floor itself! We were simply told ""Oh well... too bad."" Then when our seven year old lost a toy - we looked under a bed, for which we found a previous child's toy - how long that had been there I hate to think... the phone line barely worked and there were just numerous other things that made life hard but my absolute favourite was the staff getting into the children for 'not wearing their wrist bands' into the pool area while ignoring the adults all drinking alcohol and with glass bottles nearby despite the signs stating not to otherwise...I guess it was ok because they had their wrist bands on though, right? It was just vastly inconsistent in what they did and did not do for their guests.",,,,,,,,HojoAnaheimStaff,Guest Relations,2019-11-06,"Hello Kirsty,
We are sorry to hear you were not completely satisfied during your recent stay with us. Your feedback is greatly appreciated and will help us continue to improve. We apologize for any miscommunication about your room type. Only our suites have a living room area which come with a pull out sofa sleeper. Our standard rooms with two beds do not come with a lounger. We do have the option of having a rollaway bed added to the room; since this is not included with the room rate, there is an additional charge for using it. We do our best to let our guests know this charge by having the tag on the bed so they are aware of the extra cost before using the bed; we apologize for any confusion regarding the price tag on the bed and are happy to see the front desk was able to adjust off this charge for you. We are also sorry to hear about the service you experienced with housekeeping and the pool. We will make sure to address this with our staff to make sure that the rooms are being properly serviced, and that the pool attendants make sure all rules are being followed. Thank you so much for bringing this to our attention. We always strive for improvement and will use your comments to ensure a similar experience is never repeated.

Beds were big and comfy, air con was quiet and effective.

Staff very helpful, everywhere was clean. We didn't use the pool as we were only there for 2 days.

Our room came with it's very own ALEXA - which was great fun because we don't have one at home so it amused us for far too long until we remembered we were actually there for Disney!

Jonesy1974,375,"Mold, United Kingdom",2019-11-30,NONE,2019-11-03,4,Really good hotel,"Really enjoyed our four nights here. The hotel is very good, brilliant location to the parks and very very clean rooms. The staff are lovely, so friendly and helpful. 
Rooms - bed very comfy although very high! Shower good, very clean, has fridge, micro and tea/coffee maker - use bottled water otherwise tastes funny. Has safe, iron and ironing board. We had a room overlooking the highway but the hotel has done an excellent job or ensuing you cannot hear the noise (you can hear a very very faint sound of traffic only). 
Grounds - again very clean and well kept, pool nice area, shop was good although very pricey. Good laundry and very cheap to use. 
Only two minor quibbles about this hotel. One is that the rooms need another light near the far side of the bed as there is only one bedside light on one side which is a bit strange and no overhead light and only one bedside table. 
The other quibble is this hotel really needs a bar. After a tiring day at the parks, it would be nice to sit down for a quiet drink without having to go out again or sit in you room. For such a large hotel, a bar is really a necessity. 
Apart from that, this is a good hotel and I would not hesitate in recommending",,,4.0,4.0,5.0,,,HojoAnaheimStaff,Guest Relations,2019-11-06,"Hello,

The water park has a one-foot-deep pool for really small kids and then a pirate ship with canons and three slides.  It's a great place for young children (mine is six years old) to veg out after standing in line all morning long.

skuke888,37,"Roseville, California",2019-10-31,NONE,2019-10-27,2,Housekeeping needs some help,"We stayed here 6 nights for the convenience and easy walk to the Disneyland parks.  Actually, we've stayed here before and all was great!  ...Not so much this time with the housekeeping.
I'll start with the fact that the parks were not overly crowded and the HoJo parking lot wasn't full.  This would lead me to believe the hotel was not packed full and housekeeping had a hard time keeping up.  True, they may have been short staffed, but at the end of the day, not my problem (until it became my problem).

Arrival day 1.  All was fine.  Room was clean, bathroom stocked with towels, TP, face tissue, one small (1.5"" x 1.5"") bar of soap, one small (0.5 oz?) bottle of lotion.  The shower had containers of shampoo, conditioner and shower gel locked into a holder and the user could use the pump top to ""squirt"" product out.  This reduces their cost of individual packets of soap/shampoo that people take home. I get it.  

Day 2.  We returned from a day of fun and the room was freshened and restocked as above.

Day 3. Ran out of shower gel in the morning.  Upon returning in the evening, the gel was not replaced with a new bottle and no lotion was restocked.

Day 4.  Used the tiny bar of soap in the morning.  Upon return, gel still not replace and no hand lotion again.  ...I don't think it's my job to ask that the shower gel be replaced.  Missing two of the four face towels and a dirty hand towel was on the floor.  Bed was made, but pretty ""half ass"".

Day 5.  Used up what was left of the little bar of soap.  Turned the shower gel pump nozzle around so it faced the wall.  Maybe house keeping would get the hint. Returned in the evening. No bar of soap, no hand lotion, shower gel still empty, no disposable cups (or any cups) for coffee from the Keurig.  We had been drinking coffee in the morning and coffee and cups had been replaced daily. 
Hand towel and face towel were on the floor. 
I walked down the front desk and requested some bar soap, hand lotion, show gel and disposable cups for coffee.  They balked at the shower gel and wanted to come to the room to replace the empty bottle, but I refused and said they could replace it in the morning after we left for the day.  The house agreed.

Day 6. This is getting ridiculous!  We returned from our day and now there was no Keurig coffee, no facial tissue, and no spare roll of toilet paper with only about a 1/4 roll on the spool!  Bed was still made half ass, and I gave up writing down what the towel issue was, but it wasn't stocked the same as when we arrived.

And, for the coup de grace:  on day 6, there was note under the door informing guests that there would be plumbing repairs and loss of hot water the next morning from 07:00 until noon!!  WTF??!!??  
Why would ANYBODY schedule a loss of hot water at 07:00 in the morning at a hotel???  Wouldn't one expect guest to be showering etc, in the morning getting ready to leave for the day??
Since the repairs were anticipated to take 5 hours, wouldn't a better timing for guest be, say, 10:00am to 3:00pm?  Maybe 11 to 4??  I mean, isn't the hotel in the hospitality industry and serving GUESTS well is the goal??

I don't think the repair was emergent as we still had hot water and the repairs were not ongoing when we arrived.  At worst, I'd say the repairs were urgent and possibly even overdue maintenance.  As such the hotel should better schedule the work or find a contractor who was willing to work at time better for the guests.  sigh.

Bokehfoto,106,,2019-09-30,SOLO,2019-10-22,5,Microwave available in building 1 premium rooms,"For my stay I was in one of the newly renovated rooms in Building 1.  I've only stayed here once so I'm not familiar with all the room choices but I do know there are several room options to choose from to accommodate a variety of family sizes and even those with young children.

My particular room was in Building 1 on the 6th floor with a view of the Water Playground and views of the Matterhorn at Disneyland.  I stayed in two queen beds premium room (the beds were very comfortable), very large bathroom, coffee bar with refrigerator and microwave, dresser, desk, closet with safe, tv, alexa and eating area with a decent size table with bench seating.  The room was extremely spacious and the bathroom had great lighting perfect for getting ready for your day.  Also in room on the wall was a thermostat to control the air condition/heat unit.  The vent was on the wall below the ceiling which I appreciate because it gives more airflow to the entire room.

If you didn't know it is rare these days to find a hotel with both a refrigerator and microwave available in the room.  This comes in handy for my family because being that we have food allergies, I was able to stop off at the local Walgreens for my gluten free food items and use both microwave and refrigerator to prepare my snacks when I wasn't at Disneyland.

Overall I had a pleasant stay at the Howard Johnson Anaheim Hotel & Water Playground.  The room I was in was very spacious and the beds were very comfortable.  I did not have the opportunity to partake in the on site amenities offered this trip, but the pool and water park look like so much fun for all ages to enjoy.  The walk to and from Disneyland was not bad at all, even when my legs were extremely tired it didn't feel like it was so far away, It was a short 8 minute walk to/from Disneyland.  I would highly recommend staying at this hotel and I look forward to booking my next visit with them.",,,,,,,,HojoAnaheimStaff,Guest Relations,2019-10-25,"Hi,

The location was great, easy walk to Disneyland even with a stroller.  The beds were comfortable, which is a nice change from most hotels I’ve stayed at.  I believe the parking was free, but it was self park, no valet available.  

The downside to this is my car has multiple huge scratches and dents on it from their parking lot.  We parked once we got there and didn’t move our car until we left.  Now I have damage to my car which I feel would not happen if they had valet services.  I’d rather pay for valet than have to deal with damage to my car.  Another odd thing about this hotel is that the door to the room is very small and I couldn’t get my stroller through it.  I’ve never encountered that at all the other hotels I’ve stayed at.  

The parking issue leading to damage on my car and the smaller than normal door are the two reasons why I wouldn’t stay here again.  But if you aren’t driving and parking your car there or using a stroller, I’d recommend this hotel.  ",,,,,,,,HojoAnaheimStaff,Guest Relations,2019-10-24,"Hello,

Same in the bathroom, the lights shut off after 10 min while in the shower, so thats fun. But overall its one of the nicer places on harbor. The kids splash area is small but nice.

Lorelei,1,,2019-10-31,NONE,2019-10-17,1,Ants in the room,"We were there for 5 nights. There were ants coming out of the lip gap between the sink and counter and crawling all over the counter.. We caught at least 10. When I told the front desk they said they would spray the room while we were out. I have twin toddlers!! I told them this is dangerous around young children. They never offered us a new room. Apparently they DID spray room when we were gone which I told them not too. The phone was full of static and they never fixed it. When i tried to contact the front desk it would take up to 10 mins to answer. They never offered us a new room or discount. When we were packing there was a spider on my husbands nice jacket that was hanging in the closet that he never wore. Super disappointed by their customer service. Also when we arrived we had our twins, 4 baggage and 4 back packs and two strollers and car seats. They drew us a map of which building we were in and we circled grounds for 15 mins until I went back to front office in tears asking for someone to please help us find our room and possibly with our luggage. The store ran out of apple juice on the 2nd day and was never restocked which is all our kids drink besides water. Would not recommend this place. Will not go back. The room was also very run down. The elevator would take up to 10 mins waiting for people to get on and off and was usually full which is a challenge when you have little ones not ready to go up 3 flights of stairs.",We were in the old part apparently.

Our room was spacious but was quite sparse in terms of decor. There was only one bedside cabinet and ideally you'd expect there to be one either side of the bed. The bathroom was also spacious but seriously lacked in storage space for your toiletries - they could do with some cabinets in there. The room itself had a bizarre odour (kind of like urine??) and we put this down to the air conditioning system. Our room amenities included a good size fridge, microwave and coffee machine which all worked well. 
We visited the waterpark once and there are towels available poolside. There is plenty to do around the pool but I did notice that the surfaces were extremely slippery and saw several poor children (including my own) fall over even though they weren't running. There is a separate quieter pool on site which would be suitable for swimming and is geared towards adult guests. 
There is an on-site mini-market which sells souvenirs and a selection of food and drink items. I wouldn't recommend relying on this store for your food/drink needs as it was quite expensive, even for basics like water.",,3.0,4.0,4.0,,,,HojoAnaheimStaff,Guest Relations,2019-10-16,"Hello,

Yes there are stairs and no lifts in these buildings, and the entry doors do tend to be noisy, and the skylights ensure an afternoon siesta cannot be performed in total darkness. It is a short walk to Disneyland which gives some opportunity to sample eateries should one not feel inclined to pay the premiums in the theme parks. The big plus for us was the staff.

It was just my 5yr old and I so we had enough room, but if my other son & husband were with us it would have been tight with luggage. The beds are amazingly comfortable however they are only double size. The rooms are dated but well maintained. I booked this property for the kids pool which he enjoyed every day of our stay. It would be perfect if there was a hot tub by the big pool. The walk to Disney is about 10min, 15 when you are tired and a little slower. Panera bread is close which is SO GOOD, we always eat there when visiting the states. I wish there was at least continental breakfast as an option at this hotel.

rvocin534118,1,"Fremont, California",2019-10-31,FAMILY,2019-10-10,2,Bummed the room we were given didn’t match the one on their DAILY Instagram stories,"We booked here after seeing their daily Instagram stories. My sons watched the stories each day leading up to our trip, we were so excited. Well we checked in and were assigned a room in the non refurbished building. We asked to switch or upgrade and they weren’t able to accommodate. We were so disappointed by the dated room, lack of rubber duck near the tub (every Instagram influencer that stays there and takes over their story for the day features the duck, my sons were really looking forward to this). How hard is it to put a duck in each room? Why would this be reserved for only the new building, why not the other 5 buildings on property?! In addition to these short comings our room key constantly stopped working meaning that after a 10+ hour day of Disney we got to our room with our tired cranky kids only to find that the keys once again didn’t work and my husband had to walk all the way to the front desk to get them reset. We were told “there was a request for your room to be re-keyed” which was certainly not a request from us. Another time we were told that it’s because we let the key get too close to a cell phone. We stay at a lot of hotels and this has never been a problem. The cards were in our wallets, my wallet was in my backpack along with my phone. How far away do you need to keep it?! That’s crazy. 

I will say that my boys enjoyed the pirate ship water park. The slides were fun when open, the big one was under repair the first day of our stay.

All in all we most likely won’t stay here again. ",,,,,,,,HojoAnaheimStaff,Guest Relations,2019-10-11,"Hello Rachel,
We are sorry to hear you were not completely satisfied during your recent stay with us. We have six different buildings and thirteen different room types. As of right now, only building 1 has been renovated. We are actually going to begin renovations on building 2 starting this November. Rooms are assigned based on the room type that is booked. We try our best to mention in each Instagram influencer takeover that only building 1 has completed renovations as of right now. We apologize that you were not informed of the difference between the different room types when making your reservation. With the renovated rooms, the bathrooms have been designed around a rubber duck theme with retro rubber duck artwork. To match the theme and design, we have added a complimentary rubber ducky for guests to take home in those rooms only. 
We apologize for the inconvenience you experienced with the room keys becoming demagnetized. They can be sensitive around cellphones or magnetic closure wallets. We are currently looking into new key card systems to try to eliminate this issue. 
We are so sorry we fell short of your expectations. Thank you so much for taking the time to write a review about your recent stay. We really hope you give us another try and allow us the opportunity to better serve you and your family in the future. ",2

listen_more,12,"Oakland, California",2019-10-31,FAMILY,2019-10-10,4,A wonderful stay,"A very manageable walk to Disneyland. It's about a 10 min walk. It's not too bad. But, it feels a bit long at the end of the day and we had to carry our kid back after spending 12 hours at the park one day.

The traffic light in front of the hotel does feel long. The store downstairs was really nice for us to get water, milk and cereal in the morning. A short walk to Panera bread for a more substantial breakfast. 

We stayed at the family suite which faces the freeway in Bldg 1. I'm told all family suites face the freeway. There are suites that have the park view but all of those have skylights that cannot be blocked. The room was very clean, nice, renovated, and well themed. Having 2 bathrooms is so nice! Beds were comfortable. There is a bit of freeway noise, so bring a white noise machine to sleep. A/C is quite loud and does go on and off. We turned off the A/C to sleep at night and were fine since it's CA and it gets comfortably cool at night in October. There was a stool for kids in the bathroom which was a nice touch since the sink is high.

Although the room had light blocking curtains, it leaks lights all around. The curtains are too short, so there is a big block of light that makes sleeping in extremely difficult. We are those rare people that do not get up at the crack of dawn and try to go to the park for the magic hour. So, we were really frustrated with the leaking light. These suits also face East, so the sun was blazing in. If we ever stay here again, I'll bring some painter's tape and rig up the curtains somehow to minimize light leakage. 

The swimming pool is not close to the hot tub and water playground. We knew they weren't together, but we didn't realize how far apart they were. The hot tub broke down, so we didn't get to use it. That was also disappointing since we were looking forward to soaking after a long day at the park. 

If you don't get a room with a view of the fireworks, you can see the fireworks very well from the water playground area or anywhere in/near parking lot. 

We arrived a bit early and were able to check in early. The hotel staff were generally very nice. We saw some kids getting balloon sword and pirate hat, but we weren't offered one. :-(

Keurig, microwave and fridge all worked well. We enjoyed our 3 night stay and would consider staying here again.

misstee75,7,"Sydney, Australia",2019-09-30,NONE,2019-10-09,5,Excellent stay,"I have nothing bad to say about this hotel. this is the second time we have stayed here. I booked through a travel agent so we were not able to automatically get a room in building 1 and I could not upgrade there were no rooms available for the length of our stay which was a substantial 12 nights
so next time I will book direct and hopefully get the room I want. 
just something to be wary of in a standard room
we were in building 4 on the second level and this had the dome windows that let in a lot of light at night, at first I thought it was jet lag keeping me awake but it was the light.
the second is that the beds are only double-sized, not queen, 15cm difference, you think that is nothing, however, being a bigger person it made a difference, my husband slept 1 night with me and 1 in the other with our son.

toinfinityandablog,1,"Portland, Oregon",2019-09-30,FAMILY,2019-10-08,5,Happiest Hotel On Earth,"Located across the street from Disneyland is the Howard Johnson Of Anaheim, a perfect hotel that is a short 8 minute walk to the parks. This hotel is not only convenient, but it is also clean, fun and the staff is beyond exceptional. It felt just like coming home and that it so important when I travel. I felt very safe and secure while staying at the Hojo which is a huge plus for our family. Especially with my 5 year old being special needs.

The grounds of the Hojo are meticulously kept. There is a pool and a water playground “Castaway Cove” which is a perfect place to cool down in the warm Southern California sun while you take a break from the parks. The toddler wading pool inside Castaway Cove is perfect and it has a beach style entry making it easy for the little ones. Castaway Cove is fun for all ages, so don’t forget to pack all your bathing suits and swim trunks when you go.

My family and I stayed in Building 1 on the 4th floor with a view of Disneyland and the Hojo Castaway Cove. We loved seeing the Monorail pass by and California Adventure Park in the distance. The view is fantastic, especially at night. The view of Disneyland is just another magical touch to the Hojo’s environment. Our room had one queen size bed and a set of bunk beds that my 5 year old just adored. He gradually got the courage on the second night to sleep on the top bunk. The room comes with a mini fridge, microwave, Keurig coffee maker, hair dryer, endless tv selections and free wifi. The wifi is fast and reliable, which is a huge plus in my book. It is easy to get on the connection and stay connected throughout the day.

The bathroom includes a tub so it is extra kid-friendly. I loved the extra touch of having a rubber ducky that you get to keep on the edge of the tub upon arrival. I have never had a hotel do that before and I think it is such a unique touch that quickly made Hojo my favorite home away from home. The bathroom lighting is so exceptional that I wish I had that type of lighting in my bathroom at home. I don’t think I have ever put on my make-up so straight before and so perfect. 

The Hojo has a fantastic little market called Main Street Market located on the ground floor in building one. They offer a ton of breakfast items, snacks, sunscreen, beverages, first aid supplies and souvenirs.  

This hotel truly is a gem! Our Stay at the Hojo of Anaheim completely exceeded our expectations and we walked in as friends and left as Hojo family.",,,,,,,,HojoAnaheimStaff,Guest Relations,2019-10-11,"Hi!

We were on the 4th floor so we could see the fireworks from our room! Checking in and out was easy and it was within walking distance from Disneyland.  You also get free parking for one car per room,which was great to save on Disney parking.  The Castaway Cove Water Playground was amazing our kids begged us to go there over Disney right next door ha hah! It was also a secured area so we could relax while the kids played.  There was also a full pool but we didn't use that.  There was a gift shop which had great prices on Disney souvenirs and little snacks like milk, water, cereal, bananas, etc.  There is no restaurant so that worked perfect for the mornings as there was a fridge, microwave, and keurig in the room.

Check in and check out was less than 5 minutes and we had no issues with parking.

Overall we have no complaints and would return again.  Being in the renovated bldg. 1, the room looked and felt really clean.

Tips:  There's a Walmart Supercentre less than a 10 min drive away so if you have time, go there to stock up on water, snacks, and Disney souvenirs.

We did receive a complimentary room in exchange for social media promotion, but even if I had paid full price for this room I'd still be writing this stellar review! 

The location couldn't have been more perfect, right across the street from the Disney parks and only an 8-minute walk. Our kids enjoyed the water playground a ton and we all loved the Bunk Bed room that we requested! It was in the newly renovated building #1 and our balcony faced Disneyland which was awesome. When there are fireworks at Disney you'd be able to see them from those rooms!

The room itself was very clean, obviously newly renovated and very comfortable. We liked being right across the street from Mimi's Cafe and enjoyed dinner there during our stay. The store on the first floor of Building #1 has everything you might need and lots of Disney souvenirs too, the kids loved shopping in there!

Started everyday at opening, came back to the hotel for a swim and chill time for a few hours early afternoon and returned for late afternoon and night sessions. Ironically the room access cards say ‘we strive for five’ unfortunately this is their downfall for achieving a five rating in our view. Several times we were caught outside our room in compromised situations (needing bathroom, wet from pool etc) and our access cards didn’t work to let us into our room. To add to this, we were in a room furtherest from the reception! Apparently it is a very old system and the kind folk on reception tell us that cards are very easily de-magnitised.

Linda A,9,"Mira Mesa, California",2019-08-31,FAMILY,2019-09-16,5,Love the renovation.,"Still our favorite place to stay when we visit Disneyland. The rooms are nice and clean and roomy. Everyone that works here is friendly and helpful. The main pool is nice and the little ones love the kids water park area. 

There's no restaurant or room service but there a restaurants nearby. 

Parking is easy but some of the places are tight. 

One thing that we would really like is a shuttle. There's no shuttle and it's not a that long of a walk but after a long day, a ride back would be nice.

Sylvia V,1,,2019-09-30,FAMILY,2019-09-16,3,Just ok,"My family and I recently booked a 1 night stay here over labor day weekend so that we could enjoy the ""water playground"" and head over to the parks across the street in the evening.  The short walk to Disney across the street is a definite selling point.  It was maybe 8 min. Tops. Loved that we were so close.  My main complaint was the very small pool for the entire property.  Literally 1 pool for every guest staying there. On Labor day weekend,  it was impossible to enjoy with the over crowding.  Worse than the lines across the street.  The water playground looked a lot bigger on the website.  I know you get what you pay for,  but this place was one of the more expensive non-Disney properties.  
In addition to a tiny and disappointing pool,  you have to walk through a secret door inside the closet to get to your balcony.  Never seen that before. Overall,  the rooms were clean and the beds were comfortable ",We stayed in a premium room in building 1 and had a lovely view of the 5 freeway. I guess that was the &quot;city view &quot;.,,,,,,,HojoAnaheimStaff,Guest Relations,2019-09-18,"Hello Sylvia,

It has a water park on site that my 4 year old daughter absolutely loved for hours! There is a market where you can buy everything you need such as snacks, drinks, food and even Disney merchandise. They have an arcade as well that we actually didn't utilize but I heard kids asking their parents if they can go to end the night. It's super accommodating to have all of that in once place. It is also a 10 minute walk to the Disneyland entrance and across the street of Mimi's Cafe. Rooms are fairly clean. The only complaint I had was our room was on the 2nd floor that had sky lights that weren't covered. Natural light is okay during the day, but when you want to try and sleep in, you have no choice but to wake up when the sun comes up.

- Great location for those wanting to go to Disneyland, it is across the road and there are 4-5 restaurants on the walk to the park.
- The staff are very very friendly
- Lots of families at the hotel, the pool area was large with lots of play areas at the pool, I can imagine this is a great place for families with young children to stay

The only down sides were that there were no lifts to take you up to the second floor for those staying on the top floor, a bit of a hassle when you have heavy suitcases. 
The rooms are a little outdated, in particular the bathrooms.

ECrook,23,"Calgary, Canada",2019-09-30,COUPLES,2019-09-07,5,Nothing is perfect,"We are actually still currently here, I wanted to give a  5 because I believe they deserve it HOWEVER I will say the ONLY downside is the pool. Kids (young kids) with no parents with them at the pool, throwing balls at people’s heads, running and diving in to shallow water and acting completely horrible two days in a row - better watch of the pool area and monitoring wrist bands and kiddos would be appreciated. Today a child threw up all over the pool deck and bushes, parents let him back in the pool to clean him off and no one cared, I reported it to the front desk but it seemed unimportant. Disappointed for sure that we can’t enjoy something cause it’s NEVER checked! For days we have spent hours there with zero staff checking on its condition!  Otherwise the stay was okay, we are in tower 1 which is a newly remodelled room, however our room had dust and dirt in all the doors that looked like it had never been cleaned and the glass patio door, filthy especially when the sun hit it. I feel like cleanliness is easy, makes things feel better and look better but I don’t feel it was overly clean. It is walking distance, close to the park isn’t a lie by any means and you can see the fireworks like your right in the park - it has its perks! I was originally giving this hotel a 3 star rating BUT today (even tho we had checked out early) the reservations manager called me and is working on making this right and went above and beyond to do that. So because of that; I feel they earned a 5. Nothing in life is perfect but sometimes how it’s handled is the focus. It wasn’t handled well there but has since been so - they earn my 5 star and recommendation! I believe our experience will be a learning experience and things will be better for others going forward. Hopefully!

The art in the rooms is awesome, love the Disney touch! The rubber duck when you check into your room is adorable and every room having a balcony is a bonus! It has its perks, for sure!",,,,,,,,HojoAnaheimStaff,Guest Relations,2019-09-18,"Hello Erin,

Only 1 mile to our car rental afterwards, less than 1 mile to the local pharmacy for supplies, and the staff very accommodating to any of our requests. 

Each room equipped with a fridge for food storage and our rooms (613, 617 & 619) all had a view of the Matterhorn bobsleds & hotel water park so we also got to see the fireworks every night.

Extra special shout out to James who helped me out by calling Disneyland to try and see if Fastpasses were available for the Fantasmic show.

Housecleaning was excellent, pool was closed for maintenance one day but I guess if there was an incident, I’d rather have it cleaned up than open for the kids to play in a mess.

Tage B,1,"La Crosse, Wisconsin",2019-08-31,NONE,2019-09-04,5,The ONLY place to stay for Disneyland,"We booked two rooms for our trip. One was a shorter reservation because some of our party was coming later (after the D23 Expo). Access to Disneyland and the Anaheim Convention Center was an easy walk. If you have a family with smaller children, the walk should not be a problem.

On the way to the parks, there are a few places to eat if you want to save some money on food. We did McDonald's a few mornings to get coffee and food, there is also a Panera and a Mimi's Cafe. When they say it is an 8 minute walk to the gate, they aren't kidding!

We stayed in building 1, which was just remodeled over a year ago. The choices that they made on these rooms were amazing! The bathroom was nicely adorned with modern-retro decor. Plenty of room, good water pressure and hot water. Two sinks allowed us to get ready easily in the morning.

The beds were very comfortable, plenty of good pillows, and clean linens. The VIEWS of the Matterhorn (from one of our rooms), the Incredicoaster, Mission Breakout, the Pixar Pal Around, and more were visible from the other room. How magical is it to wake up to the monorail passing by? I knew it was going to be a good day.

We used the hot tub which is located with the kids play area right next to the lobby. The temperature and atmosphere was great. We never made it over to the standard pool.

At check-in and check-out, and any time that we had questions about anything the front desk staff was very friendly and helpful. In fact, one of the staff made a balloon turtle for us! So cool. One of the days we also saw that they were doing face painting and temporary tattoos.

The store in building 1 was also useful for a couple of items that we forgot.

My kiddo and I stayed here 2 years ago for her 3rd bday and had a fantastic weekend. We returned nearly 2 years later and what a difference! We booked a family room with a bunk bed (which she fell in love with), mama lounged while she played in pirates cove and she had no problem making friends with several very rambunctious kids from different parts of the country. We visited downtown Disney, ate at several popular eateries nearby,and after a long day of fun took a dip in the pool and swam until dark. This hotel is beyond kid friendly and it was really nice to be around other families with kids similar in age. Gave the parents a little break from entertaining ;). My kiddo even got a souvenir pirates hat and a pink balloon sword from the very accommodating gentleman who checked us in for the weekend. This weekend exceeded my expectations. Thanks for

Even though there are no lifeguards, there was staff available to supervise the water playground and stock  enough fresh towels. 

The room was spacious for my 3 kids and I. Having a microwave and fridge in the room make such a big difference when you have kids. The gift shop hours are amazing (7am to 11pm), especially since you never know when you might need something. The gift shop staff were very, very kind, patient and professional. 

There were plenty of staff at the front desk available to check-in and out, or even just answer some question. The grounds are clean and nothing is too far. The parking is great- you can't park too far from the building your room is in. I was reminded how nice it is to just have friendly staff.

We stayed in Building 1 in a room with bunk beds for the kids. It was tastefully renovated and the kids loved the welcome gift of the rubber duck. The waterpark is great for little children, as well as the garden pool which is deeper. We had a view of the fireworks from our room, which was great after a long day at the park. We loved the little extras you can get in the reception area .. pirate hats, candies from the treasure box, and a discount coupon for McDonalds. The free parking was also a plus, and they allowed us to extend the parking free of charge when we mentioned there had been a noise issue in the room (a ticking noise in the area of the main door).

"Daryl Wilson, Art & Story Photography",1,"Denver, Colorado",2019-08-31,BUSINESS,2019-08-31,5,"Beautiful room. Very clean. Excellent view. Helpful, friendly staff. Very close to Disneyland.","Wow! It has been a few days since we returned from staying at this HoJo across the street from Disneyland in Anaheim, CA, and we are still talking about how great our stay there was.

As we entered the lobby, it was clean...very clean. I swear that they cleaned the exterior and interior spaces several times per day during our week-long stay there.

When we arrived, we had several hours before the official check-in time at 4pm, so we left our luggage and my very expensive professional camera gear (I'm a publicist and a professional photographer) in their secure back area for what may have only been 45-60 minutes before being alerted, while we were poolside and enjoying the shade and cool breeze over the water, to our room being ready (yes, they gave us pool access to lounge around until our room was readied).

Upon our room becoming ready, we were personally escorted to the building next to the check-in building, with our luggage in tow, then taken up the elevator to the 3rd floor, to the room nearest the elevator (Bldg. 1, Room 305). The downstairs lobby, the elevator and the hallway looked like they were only recently renovated, but when we inquired, she said that this building was renovated more than 5 years ago. Wow. It looked brand spanking new and clean everywhere we looked. Cleanliness is so important to us when we are choosing a hotel to stay in.

When we entered the room, it was very comfy-looking and clean, even smelling fresh. There were framed Mickey Mouse prints on the walls, with textured wallpaper on the wall in matching colors...and a yellow rubber ducky on the bathtub, which came home with us. Not sure what the small rubber ducks have to do with HoJo, but it was adorable and matched the rubber duck print on the bathroom wall, too.

And, if you are reading my review of HoJo Anaheim, I left a $100 bill behind one of the wall prints in that room, as I like to do whenever I stay at a hotel and am impressed enough to want to leave a review. So, if you are fortunate enough to stay in that room, look for the $100 bill. Unless someone else got to it before you, then it should still be there. I carefully propped it behind the frame, at the bottom.

We loved the balcony from the 3rd floor. We were able to see the fireworks from Disneyland easily, and I enjoyed watching the monorail cars going back and forth behind the traffic on Harbor Blvd. My wife setup the two padded blue stools on the balcony to relax with the cool breeze on our faces, while the sounds of the wind and the water from the hotel's mini waterpark lulled us into a very relaxed state.

The beds were just firm enough to be comfortable, not too soft. The linens were bright white, soft and clean-smelling. The pillows were encased with zippered inner covers, in addition to the outer pillow cases, that are intended to prevent stains from passing to the pillow itself (we use these at home, too), as well as to prevent the possibility of bed bug infestations. When you rest your head on the pillows, it takes longer for the pillows to deflate and shape to your head, as a result. I believe the comforter itself was also encased in a similar duvet.

In the closet, we found a full size collapsible/folding ironing board, a steam iron, several wooden hangers in the closet for our clothing, and a secure digital safe just big enough for our valuables, which we could custom set our own access PIN. There was also a dry cleaner bag with instructions on how to have your personal laundry and dry cleaning picked up from your room, professionally cleaned and returned the next day. This is a much appreciated service on longer stays, especially if you have messy children or you want to remove the chlorine from your swimsuits and robes after taking dips in the hotel's pool and jacuzzi, or running around the on-site mini waterpark. The ironing board and steam iron, however, were sufficient for us this time.

Also in the room was an Amazon Alexa device which was always connected via the hotel's free Wi-Fi, in addition to the smart television mounted to the wall, with cable TV and several choices for streaming movies, including Netflix, YouTube, Hulu and others. Once you go through the simple steps needed to authorize the smart television to access your streaming subscriptions, it just works wonderfully. Plus, these permissions are deleted upon checkout automatically, so you needn't worry about someone checking into the room after you leave, then having access to your streaming subscriptions. You also have the option to remove these permissions with a single menu click from the television remote control.

The room also included a mini fridge that is slightly larger than a dorm room sized mini fridge and a microwave, as well as Keurig coffee/tea maker, several individually-wrapped cups and packets with sugar, sugar substitute, creamer, coffee stirrers and a napkin bundled together and sealed. The coffeemaker came in handy on those mornings when we wanted to drink tea or one of the flavored coffees that were in our room.

There was also a gift basket on the table with a welcome card for us which included two (real glass) champagne glasses and a large bottle of champagne, several snacks and goodies (Disney-themed Jelly Bellys, microwave popcorn, travel sized cereal, flavored coffee K-cups, tea bags, misc.) and a ceramic HoJo cup that looked just like the disposable paper cups by the coffee machine. We ended up leaving the champagne and the glasses chilling in the fridge when we checked out, however, because we cannot bring them aboard the airplane and were too busy with Mice Chat, D23 and Disneyland from early morning to very late each evening to sit down and enjoy the champagne, but it was much appreciate regardless.

Every day, we saw their cleaning crews vacuuming and shampooing the carpets, wiping down the walls, power washing the sidewalks and roof, scrubbing the exterior walls, taking care of the grounds, picking up little bits of garbage and such here and there. It was very evident that the staff at HoJo really cared for their property and their guests' comfort.

There was a nice gift shop downstairs on the lower level which had novelty gifts (lots of Disney-inspired items, aspirin, hats, shirts, misc.) as well as snacks (sandwiches, chips, etc.) and cold drinks (sodas, juices, milk, bottled water, etc.). This was so convenient when we were looking for a quick bite or something cold to drink, and we were not wanting to go to MiMi's Cafe across the street. MiMi's Cafe, by the way, is great food and reasonably priced, and there was a fast dial button on our room phone for MiMi's. How cool is that...MiMi's was on speed dial?! LOL

The bathroom was immaculately clean and there were plenty of towels for us, without need for additional towels until the last night there when we sat in the jacuzzi tub while watching the Disneyland fireworks show and having pleasant conversation with other hotel guests (after the children left the mini waterpark area for bed).

The room was quiet, too. Once we closed the sliding door to the balcony, the sound was immediately and dramatically lowered, even the Disneyland fireworks show was muffled quite considerably. The glass of the sliding doors were tinted somewhat, too, and the blackout curtains did an excellent job of keeping out the sunlight and the heat from entering the room. We were impressed.

We will be back, definitely!! The Howard Johnson Hotel Anaheim is a 5-star hotel, in our experience. We cannot recommend this hotel enough.

Arrived with a tired toddler praying we could check-in early. The front desk staff were amazing! We literally were in our room within 3 minutes of arrival. The 2 bedroom family suite was super cute and just right for our family.  The room was spotless with thoughtful touches throughout. The soundproofing is amazing! Our room overlooked the highway, but couldn't hear a thing. My only minor quibble is that the door to the suite was located off the kids room. The splash zone was a lot of fun.

AnnMarieGrace,599,"Adelaide, Australia",2019-08-31,NONE,2019-08-22,5,Great Family Friendly Hotel Close to Disney,"We picked this hotel because we decided to take the kids to Disney Parks in Anaheim and we wanted something that was close and nice. Howard Johnson exceeded our expectations.

It is about an 8-minute walk to the Disney Parks. This was great especially during the day as it was quick and easy to get back to our hotel, so we could have a rest before continuing our day at the Parks.

Our check-in experience was amazing, we arrived tired and late (about 7pm) with the kids. Michael checked us in and was friendly and happy. The kids were able to pick a candy each from the treasure chest, they received a pirate hat and sword balloon each and a special balloon turtle to share (that we named Turtle, Turtle). It was a lovely and exciting way to begin our Disneyland Park of our vacation.

Also, during check-out, Michael took the time to explain to us the facilities while marking everything on a map as well as gave us a map of the area with a coupon dining guide. This was handy as we were able to save some money from our favourite diner ‘Denny’s’.

When we arrived in our room it was bigger than we expected, and everything was clean and tidy. Within the room was a fridge and microwave which was handy as we went to Walmart to buy groceries for breakfast, lunch for Disney (we made sandwiches) and snacks. There are no crockery or cutlery included so I recommended bringing your own or buying plastic ones from the store.

Our room and resort area had Wi-Fi included as well as parking. Sleeping at night was relaxing and peaceful, the beds are comfortable, and the noise level was low.

The Castaway Cove is a fun pirate ship water play area with slides, a mushroom, mini pool, and other fun activities. The kids had so much fun playing, swimming and running under the bucket every time it emptied

There is a swimming pool, I didn’t get a chance to swim however it looked lovely and clean. My husband did swim in the pool and he mentioned it was busy (around 3 pm) and was not able to get a deck chair, so I recommend getting in early.

Our flight was not till 9 pm and we were able to get checkout until 1 pm, our luggage stored and full access to the castaway area.

Overall, we were blown away with our stay at Howard Johnson and highly recommend this hotel whether you are going to Disney Parks or a nice getaway hotel for 2 to 3 nights with the kids (as there is plenty on sight for the kids to do). We would be happy to stay here again and recommend this place to families.",,,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,HojoAnaheimStaff,Guest Relations,2019-09-01,"Hello Ann,

From the moment we entered the lobby, I knew this would be a 5-star review. We were greeted by Chris, who was such a pleasure to work with. He was so polite and engaging with my kids and set us up in the perfect room in bldg#1. We stayed in the 1-king with an adjoining room with bunk beds for the kids. The room is newly upgraded, had great amenities and was sooo clean. The waterpark (castaway cove) was a lot of fun for the kids, we ended up going back at night for them to enjoy it again and stayed until 9:30pm to watch the fire work show (perfect view) from Disneyland.

We are sorry to hear you were not completely satisfied during your recent stay with us. Our guaranteed check in time is at 4pm. We always try our best to accommodate early check in requests but may not always have a room ready early prior to our check in time. During the busy summer months, we tend to sell out most nights. Since check out isn't until 12pm and housekeeping needs time to service all of the rooms, we can only guarantee our rooms ready by 4pm. We are happy to hear we were able to get you a room early before 4pm. We always recommend reserving the room starting from the night before if you are planning on arriving early and need to guarantee an early check in. This way the room is already prepared for you once you arrive. We are so sorry the reservationist who assisted you with your booking did not inform you of this option. We are also more than happy to store your luggage and give you access to the pools while we finish preparing the room for you. We really hope you give us another try and allow us the opportunity to better serve you and your family in the future. ",2
Richard S,2,"London, United Kingdom",2019-08-31,FAMILY,2019-08-11,5,Great location and amazing staff.,"We arrived very early on our day of arrival and right from the first interraction with Joel the staff were all superb.
The room was in ""building 1"" and therefore newly refurbished- decent sized with enough space for 4 people plus microwave and coffee machine.

The waterpark and pool were great for days when we didn't go to Disney and the shop was also handy to have on site.
The only thing to be aware of is that the hotel doesnt have a restaurant on site but you are within 5 mins walk of a few options (the closest being Mimi's across the road).

The key advantage for us was that it is literally 8 mins walk to Disney so with kids of 4 and 6 we got there for ""rope drop"", or opening as most people would call it, and then nipped home for a few hours sleep at 1pm to miss the heat and crowds, returning at 5pm for fireworks and the shows.
The distance means you can do this easily without worrying about shuttles like most other hotels.

Staff throughout our stay were all superb and we would thoroughly recommend this as a place to stay if you are visiting Disney.","Building one has been refubished, some rooms will have views of the fireworks.",,,,,,,HojoAnaheimStaff,Guest Relations,2019-08-17,"Hello Richard,

Also perfect spot to view fireworks at night.   Only suggestion is a better hide abed in living room.  And a larger fridge with a freezer in it. It has a ton of cupboard space which we did not utilize.   Water park was pretty good  our six year old granddaughter enjoyed it tremendously.

Dogboy63,227,"Sydney, Australia",2018-12-31,NONE,2019-08-05,5,Great place to stay after a long trip,"To be honest I had to be talked into staying here, as we had previously stayed at the Disneyland Hotel and I thought that was awesome.  But it was Christmas time and all the inns were full, so we agreed to book Howard Johnson.  We flew from Sydney Australia, leaving on Christmas Day in Australia and arriving on Christmas Day in the USA after a 16 hour flight.

What a lovely place!  The check-in was friendly and we were soon checked in to a great room with a reasonably good view.  I had heard about the Shuttles but we didn't need them - it was 10 minutes easy walk to Disneyland, and it was so close we could pop back during the day when necessary.

The room was warm and the bed was one of the best I have ever slept in - so comfy and very restful after a long flight and a few hours in Disneyland.  On one of the nights of our stay we had an early night, and we were able to view most of the Disney fireworks show from our balcony.  

Check-out was an easy process, and once again very friendly staff.  We did not use the water park - it was winter and pretty cold - but they gave us entry tickets just in case.  It is very close to some good places to eat.  

I'm a convert - the Howard Johnson is great and I would happily stay there again.",,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,,HojoAnaheimStaff,Guest Relations,2019-08-12,"Hi,

Anton Ego,65,"Walt Disney World, Florida",2019-07-31,FAMILY,2019-08-05,3,"Disappointed, Average at Best","For years I have been wanting to stay at the Howard Johnson. My family and I are out of State travelers who hold Disneyland APs so we frequent the parks 2-3 times a year. Mousesavers highly recommends this hotel and based on the TripAdvisor reviews, I was really excited about our stay.

Check In Process

We arrived on July 24th, a Wednesday, at around 11:30 PM. When we arrived the parking lot is ""gated""-- basically like if you were waiting for a train to pass and we had to phone in to get access. This gate was only down during the evenings, not during the day. We drove around the parking lot only to be exasperated because there was no parking. There were several other cars doing the same, looking for a spot, with no spot in sight. After 15 minutes of frustration and driving around, we parked in the temporary spot for check ins and I went inside to talk to the front desk. They explained if there was no parking, we could park in their sister location next door at the Courtyard Marriott. We were lucky enough, that during check in, someone pulled out and left the parking lot, and my husband rushed out to move our car. But we were very unimpressed that they have a lack of parking for all of their patrons and made us rethink leaving any time in the evening to do anything because we would have to give up our spot. We got our hotel room keys, and our bracelets for the water park (and they explained that if we lost them they would not replace them), and we wandered off to our room.

Room (Building One)
Our first room was located in Building One, on the first floor, room 110. Immediately upon entering we noticed a really awful, funky smell. Like gym socks with a fake orange scent on top of it. It was pretty terrible. I thought if we could open the sliding door outside, get some fresh air, it would help. But this room backed to the freeway and to mask the noise, they have enclosed the patio. And in order to access the patio you have to go through the closet (so weird), through a tiny door that has dead bolt. Then you enter the patio, which is also enclosed, and then you can open another sliding door to access a small balcony that over looked like a service entry below. Needless to say, there wasn't going to be any fresh air coming in through the closet, through the enclosed patio, and it just made the noise from the freeway loud. 

Before unpacking--- I called down to the front desk to see what could be done. The front desk agent was nice, but his solution was to send a fan and some febreeze. That wasn't going to be help as the fan would just circulate the air that smelled, and finally got him to offer to switch us room. Which seemed to be the only logical solution. He put me on hold for about 5 minutes, then came back on the line to inform me that there were no current rooms available in my room type. Howard Johnson did offer to comp that room for the night (I believe his name was Joel) since we could not move and did send a fan and some really terrible smelling AirWick freshner spray. Neither helped with the smell of the room, which I suspected wouldn't. 

Second Hotel Room (After Moving)

We went into Disneyland early in the morning and called around noon, as was instructed, to see about the room switch. I talked to another front desk agent who said, had we packed up our luggage they could have seamlessly switched our rooms and luggage for us. But since we were not instructed to do so, they were requesting we return from the parks to pack up and move and would let us know when the room would be available. They never gave me a set time, and again was disappointed, because we had lunch reservations at Blue Bayou and was not giving them up as Disney charges you $50 if you don't show up for your reservation. I told them it would have to wait until after lunch before we could switch. I also had to give the front desk my phone number (which is weird I thought they had it when I made the reservation) so they could call me and let us know when the room was ready. They called around 3 PM and I let them know we would be at the hotel around 3:30 PM to move our stuff. It was really inconvenient that we had to leave the parks in the middle of the day, walk back to our hotel, and switch our rooms. We were moved to Building One, Room 209 on the second floor. Thankfully the second room was not smelly and the balcony was actually usable. 

Rooms Overall

The rooms are spacious and remodeled even though the hotel property itself is old, probably built in the 60's. The room featured a flat screen TV (which we never watched except for a few minutes), a landline phone, the balcony (with no furniture to sit on), two Queen beds, a closet, iron/ironing board, and a Bathroom with two sinks (and hairdryer). Although I appreciated the two sinks, it was kind of a bummer that both sinks are in the actual bathroom and not a sink outside so two people could get ready in the morning. Biggest gripe about the hotel room. Although we did appreciate the nice mattresses and the USB plugs for our phones. The ceilings don't do any justice for keeping out noise from your upstairs neighbors, and we were at the mercy of our neighbors upstairs whom we heard a lot of foot traffic from and did disturb our sleep. 

Perks of the Hotel

Although parking is an issue at this hotel, the location is pretty close to Disneyland. This is the last hotel on Harbor before the 5. You have to pass by the Panera, McDonalds, and several other properties before you cross to the Esplanade but its a ten minute walk. The grounds were in nice shape and there is a nice sitting area if you smoke cigarettes. 

We did appreciate the gift shop that opens up at 7 AM and closes at around 10 PM. Has some snacks, souvenirs, and the likes and adds a nice touch if you forgot anything. The hotel only provides a small shampoo, a conditioner, a body lotion, 2 bars of soap, and a box of kleenex. Besides towels and wash cloths, there is nothing else besides the coffee and tea. 

The Pools

I was excited about the kid pool for my son, who is 11. I booked this hotel and one of the main factors was the water park. Underwhelming is the water park. Probably only good for kids up to age 8 or younger. There is one small slide and a kiddie pool there with some water features. Kind of bummed about this. 

The Garden Pool was always super crowded. It was hard to find a spot to set your stuff but the kiddo enjoyed the pool temperature and spent an hour a day swimming. The pool was an average size. The nice touch about the pools were the provided towels. They close the ""water park"" at 9 PM sharp and they close the garden pool at 10 PM. Kind of a bummer when you are at the pool, in the middle of summer. But it is what is. 

Internet/Service

Absolutely ZERO at this hotel. I have Verizon and my husband and I could not receive/make phone calls or text messages when we were in Building One. I would get all my messages the moment I would get to the parking lot of the hotel and was a serious PAIN that we didn't have any cell service. Also, we always had issues with the internet. We had to call the front desk and they had to help us manually use the internet on our phones. Needless to say using my laptop was out of the question in the hotel. Really made doing any business, while on vacation, incredibly hard and inconvenient. 

Check Out

Check Out was on the TV, and instructions were left in the hotel room. I tried to check out on the TV but it wouldn't let me. So I ended up calling the front desk and letting them know we were leaving and we left our hotel keys in the room. It was easy, but couldn't figure out why the TV wouldn't let us check out. 

All in all I give this hotel an AVERAGE based on kind of inflated price and the rooms. After all the hype I read about this hotel, I really expected something better based on all the reviews and recommendations. At $200 a night I really felt this hotel was not worth the price. We have stayed at the Fairfield, two properties down, at a cheaper rate then what we paid and felt the rooms/service/views were much, much better than the Howard Johnson. Howard Johnson does not charge for parking, but they make up that difference in inflated room rates and you are not guaranteed a spot on property. Also, based on lack of cell service at the property, lack of parking, would probably not stay in the hotel again. Service was pretty good, location was good, but the service and location can't make up for the things that are lacking here.",Stay Away from the Main Floor of Building One,3.0,3.0,,5.0,,,HojoAnaheimStaff,Guest Relations,2019-08-12,"Hi,

LCoal,18,"Tulsa, Oklahoma",2019-07-31,FAMILY,2019-08-01,2,Not all rooms are created equal,"I will start this review by saying, Paula the manager was incredibly kind and quickly addressed our concerns. We stayed here 5 years ago and had a good experience, which is why we chose to stay here again. This time, we had a very different experience. Our first room looked like a rundown Motel 6. There was food on the floor, brown stains on the mattress, stains on the carpet that looked and felt like they had not been addressed or attempted to clean, and black dirty looking grout in the bathroom (I don’t think this bathroom has ever been updated). The room smelled like a nursing home. The overall presence felt dirty and run down. Not what I pictured when paying around $250 per night. We called the front desk and Michael listened to our concerns and promptly came down to address the issues. He initially said when booking through a Disney Consultant there were only specific rooms allotted, but he would get us another room. I had never heard this and will look into it. He quickly assigned us another room in a “newer” building. Upon review of the second room, we approached the bathroom and noted brownish-yellow water on the toilet seat and on the floor. We went straight to the front desk and spoke with the manager Paula. She and Michael were kind and understanding. They offered us a third room. We entered the building (building with the gift shop) and it was an immediate improvement. This room was greatly improved from the first two rooms, and we were very grateful. Unfortunately, we discovered we did not have hot water. We would have to run the shower for about 5 minutes to get warm water and it would quickly leave. However, I was thankful to have a clean room, so we just dealt with it. The pirate splash pad area is cute for younger kids. The location is great, as well. It is a quick walk to the parks. Overall, I would recommend if you want to stay here, make sure to request the new building. Otherwise, you may want to look somewhere else. I think the grounds are in need of a serious update. Paula and Michael were very kind and quickly addressed our concerns. I was very impressed with their service (5/5 stars for their service). They documented the issues and said they would use it to train the staff. The Howard Johnson did right by hiring these two. 

The attached pictures were taken upon entering the rooms. (Those hairs are not ours).",,,,,,,,HojoAnaheimStaff,Guest Relations,2019-08-07,"Hi,

Sadaf A,59,"Sugar Land, Texas",2019-07-31,FAMILY,2019-07-30,4,Close to Disneyland,"We loved our stay here . The best part was that it’s just a 10 minute walk from Disneyland. We would leave early morning for the parks and used to come back to our room for a quick recharge during the afternoon when it got really hot. This ensured that the kids especially my toddler was all fresh to enjoy the parks till late night which is when the fireworks and other shows take place.
Another reason why we chose Howard Johnson was it’s water playground. When we were done with Disney the kids loved splashing around .
There was also a small gaming arcade and coin operated guest laundry which came in handy for me as we prefer carrying minimal luggage.
The room was a bit small but clean and comfortable and was equipped with microwave, mini fridge, coffee maker and iron.. It also had a balcony.
There are many fast food joints between the hotel and Disneyland which saved us a lot of time. We would grab breakfast and eat on our way to the parks so that we could reach before rope drop. Early morning is the best time to go on rides since lines are really short or almost non existent plus weather is pleasant.",,,5.0,,5.0,4.0,,HojoAnaheimStaff,Guest Relations,2019-08-05,"Hi,

We have stayed here a few times in the past and always nice. This trip we had connecting rooms on the 7th floor. The remodel that was recently done was awesome and this 54 year old hotel looks so up to date, you would never know the age of it. Everything about the room was so comfortable. And the staff at the front desk was as nice as could be. I loved their smiles, helpfulness, and friendliness every time I had a question about something. But the best part about our stay was our housekeeper, Alma. She was very friendly every time we encountered her in the hallway, etc. And the rooms were made up and replenished perfectly every day. It's so nice to have a happy face when you pass her in the hall and when we were so exhausted from our days in the parks. I can't say enough how pleased we were with this stay.  All around excellence!  Thank you Alma and HoJo Anaheim!

There were two Amazon Echos in the suite. We used them to check the weather and order additional pillows. The housekeeping staff was very attentive. I left notes if we needed anything different, and they were responsive.

Billy,5,"Whittier, California",2019-07-31,COUPLES,2019-07-19,4,Billy Travelers,"What customers want in a Hotel ?
1. Good deal, fair price.
2. No bad smells in room. No sewer smells, no musty smells etc.
3. Clean room. 
4. Clean filters & working Air conditioner & heating.
5. Comfortable Bed. 
6. Quiet room while resting, napping & sleeping
7. Nice Staff
8. Hotel staff that is Caring & are Good problem solvers if any of the above goes wrong. 
9. Above are the basics if your staying for free
     or your paying thousands per night.
If a hotel hits the first 8 steps correct ? 
Then I would stay in that Hotel even if there
Price was $50.00 per night.
It’s sad to say that the 3 1/2 star to 4 star hotels
don’t Satisfy the first 8 points above.
Our stay at Howard Johnson’s 
Check-in July 15th, 2019
Check-out July 18th, 2019
Cons 
1. Put us in a building that the hall ways 
Smelled like pee and a horse  stable.
2. The inside of the room smelled like mold,
 musty and possibly Pee.
3. My wife could not take the smell and had to 
 Leave the building. 
4. I had to stay in the room until a hotel worker moved our bags out of the building.
5. This wasted our vacation time.
Pro’s 
1.  Called the manager and after about 
20 to 25 minutes they moved us out of that room. 
2.  They moved us to a room that had no smells. 
3.  The new room was clean, 
4. With comfortable beds, 
5. Soundproof from the freeway that was right next to the room, 
6. Quiet room for resting, napping & sleeping. 
7. The room had central air and Heating, but the filter element was full of dust. I requested a new filter and maintenance changed the filter element the next day.
8.  The sheets on the bed made my wife itchy. So I requested for the maid service to change the sheets. They change the sheets the next day and my wife wasn’t itchy anymore. 
9. Pricing for this hotel is very high for what you get.
17% tax rate. We all know that the entire Hotel industry is out of control ! with high prices ! But if there is a hotel that will start working on better fair pricing for there quests, that’s the hotel that I and many others, that would turn into the goto Hotel !  
10.  I have a go to hotel that meets all of the points above  and I try to stay there whenever I go to orange county. 
10. I can say that the Howard Johnson hotel staff where not only  empathetic and nice.  But they 
actually did something to help make our state better  !!! The manager took care of our needs !!!
For this ! I call it a come back from zero to Hero !
11. When I Made a request for service the hotel staff to care of our needs !  For this I am thankful.",,,,,,,,HojoAnaheimStaff,Guest Relations,2019-07-22,"Hello Billy,

The hotel has nice and well kept grounds including a little convenience store with gas station prices, so higher than a store but not the typical ridiculous hotel prices, and it stays open until 11pm, which was a great feature. It is extremely close to Disney. It was sparkling clean, the two queen room was very large with a microwave and mini fridge. The staff was all enthusiastic and helpful. The water park area is fun, well kept, and just a great place to take small kids. We were travelling with teenagers and toddlers - this hotel was great for all. The second pool was quiet and relaxing. The facilities cater to small children so it's a great place to go with kids, but it isn't chaotic or loud, and still feels like a nice spot. Check-in is on the late side (4pm) and there is no wiggle room on check-out (noon). All in all this was a great value and a very nice hotel. I would go out of my way to stay at one.

We were in Anaheim for a Disneyland vacation and it was a short walk from the hotel to the resort.

Ashley K,3,"Waurn Ponds, Australia",2019-07-31,FAMILY,2019-07-06,1,Not at all how it is advertised on Instagram. ,"This hotel was not what is advertised on instragram. We had been following the Hojo account for months excited about this trip. However when we arrived with 2 kids under 4, and prams. One of our rooms wasn’t ready at 2pm and the rooms were up stairs, meaning we had to carry all our luggage up the stairs and strollers up and down every day. No elevator and no one to help us. They obviously put us in the old part of the hotel as the room was old, old carpets etc, not like it looks on insta with the bright modern colours and Mickey Mouse wall hangings. Our room had 2 big windows up the top, with no curtains so the natural light comes in early and makes it hard for kids to have naps during the day or sleep in past dawn. All we could hear was the banging doors from down stairs and we were right next to a busy road. The staff at reception weren’t particularly helpful either. 
My parents, who we were Traveling with us safe stopped working mid way through our stay and both ours and their keys also stopped working, so we had to have them reissued.
We met another family from Australia who were also put right down the back in the old building (we booked 9 months in advance, so this wasn’t a last minute booking). I am wondering if they give the international guests the crappy rooms.
The best thing about this hotel was the cleaner, our room was always left clean by her and it’s also located next to Mimi’s, a good restaurant.
I would not stay here again. A very poor experience I have not received for a long time. ",,,,,,,,HojoAnaheimStaff,Guest Relations,2019-07-06,"Hello Ashley,
We are sorry to hear you were not satisfied during your recent stay with us. Our check in time is at 4pm. We always try our best to accommodate early check in requests but may not always have early check in available, especially during the busy, high peak summer months. We apologize for any inconvenience not having your room ready at 2pm may have caused; we hope we were able to get one of your rooms the early check in or store your luggage while housekeeping finished preparing the room for you. We also apologize that once you received your room it was on the second floor. Our front desk staff should have asked you if you had a stroller before assigning you to a floor with no elevator. Thank you for letting us know about this so we can look into your check in and retrain our staff on checking to make sure our guests are okay being on the second floor. Our staff should have also offered to assist with your luggage; we are truly sorry that this was not offered to you. We have 6 different buildings and 12 different room types on our property. As of right now, only building 1 has been renovated. Building 2 renovations are scheduled to begin in November of this year. Room and building locations are assigned based on the room type booked. As an equal opportunity hotel with employees from diverse backgrounds, we would never want our guests to feel they are being treated differently based on where they come from. We are so sorry if it seemed like you were given a specific location based on being from Australia. The room keys can become demagnetized if kept near cellphones or magnets. You can always give us a call or stop by the front desk and we would be more than happy to remake the keys for you. We are happy to hear you enjoyed the clean room and Mimi's Café. We really hope you give us another try and allow us the opportunity to better serve you and your family in the future. ",10

The A/C in our room didn't work the last 2 days of our stay.  We called the front desk, and they kept telling us the A/C was fixed.  However, we simply couldn't get our room cooler than 75 or 76 the last 2 days.

Someone got on the elevator just before us, and got stuck.  I felt bad for them, and staff did seem quick to respond, but still I didn't like seeing that happen.  The rest of the trip my kids kept thinking we were going to get stuck in the elevator.

Our building had no water for an afternoon.  Again the staff responded to resolve the issue, however, the hotel did not advise us, we only heard hearsay from other guests.

And I think the final dagger was when we asked if we could leave our car in the parking lot for an additional few hours after check out.  Keep in mind the parking lot was half empty when we asked.  One attendant said yes, but then the other desk attendant said yes if we give them an extra $20.  I suppose it's the fact that we were pretty patient with them through all the annoying issues experienced, but hitting me up for more money after spending A TON of money to stay here for 5 days left a bitter taste.",,,3.0,,4.0,3.0,,HojoAnaheimStaff,Guest Relations,2019-07-06,"Hi Chris and Bethany,
We are sorry to hear you were not completely satisfied during your recent stay with us. Your feedback is greatly appreciated and will help us continue to improve. We are so sorry to hear about the problems you had with the A/C and that it was still not getting cooler after you were told it was fixed, as well as the water being out in your building. We will make sure our head engineer is aware of this and inspects the unit to ensure it was fixed properly or replace it if needed. Thank you for bringing this to our attention. We did have a rare, unexpected occurrence where the elevator was briefly stuck. The elevators are computer monitored so if something happens, we are able to quickly react. We are sorry you had to witness this and completely understand how it could cause your kids to worry. As one of the few hotels near Disneyland that offers free parking, we do reach full capacity during high peak times as the day progresses. In order to ensure there are parking spaces available later in the evening for our guests who still need to check in, parking is complimentary until 3pm on the day of check out. If we have extended parking available, there is an additional charge in order to ensure we can maintain availability for all our guests checking in.

Amy B,27,"Salem, Oregon",2019-06-30,FAMILY,2019-07-02,5,Excellent stay with kids! Book it! (Room 1409),"The Highlights:

- Easy walk to the Disneyland Resort
- Amazing water playground 
- Beautifully renovated rooms in Building 1
- Stay in Building 1, Park View (worth the extra $)

We have stayed at hotels in the Disneyland Resort as well as VRBO rental condos and homes nearby.  All of those options were great, but for the value and the amenities, we will absolutely stay here at the Howard Johnson the next time we come to Disneyland. 

We read through many of the reviews here at TripAdvisor before we made our reservation. I'm happy to say that the hotel met or exceeded our expectations in all areas. The first thing to note is that Building 1 has been fully renovated. If you want a modern room with clean, crisp details, this is where you want to stay. I loved the mid-century feel of the room, furnishings and artwork. It was bright and fun, exactly what you would imagine for a visit to Disneyland. The room and bathroom were impeccably clean and refreshed daily. I did not personally visit the other buildings, but the photos on the Howard Johnson web site very clearly show the difference between the renovated rooms in building 1 and the rest of the property. The other rooms are obviously dated, but they are also slightly less expensive. It was worth it to us to pay a little extra to stay in Building 1. I imagine the rest of the buildings will eventually be updated as well, so if you're looking for an awesome deal and don't mind dated furnishings, pick an older room! The other amenities would still make the stay worth it.  Just look at the photos on the website and understand what you are choosing before you arrive. 

The other important tip that we got from another reviewer here was to choose a park side room, rather than a city view room. The city view rooms face the I-5 freeway and can be noisy if you are sensitive to noise. We chose the park view room, which gave us a view of the water playground. Our room was on the fourth floor, Room 1409. We were pleasantly surprised the evening of check-in to realize that we also had an excellent view of the fireworks from our balcony! We didn't realize we were situated well enough to see them, so that was an exciting perk.

We had two-day park hopper tickets for Disney, and we chose to stay the night before visiting the parks, and the two nights after.  That felt like the perfect amount. We checked in right on time for our first night, and spent the afternoon and evening playing at the water playground. Our son is 7 years old, and he happily played at the water playground for several hours. He enjoyed it so much that he asked to go back and take a break from Disneyland one afternoon that we were in the park! We brought takeout to one of the many tables in the water playground for dinner. There is no restaurant on site, but they have a well-stocked convenience store with snacks and breakfast items, and Mimi's Cafe, Panera, and McDonalds are all a very easy walk.

The walk to Disneyland is advertised as 8 minutes to the gate. I'd say it felt even shorter than that. As other reviewers have mentioned, I would be sure to cross the street immediately at Manchester and Harbor, rather than walking all the way past the restaurants and other hotels before crossing to the park. Then you beat some of the crowds heading to the gate. It is nice though, to stop at Panera for breakfast on the way to the park. Just depends on your priorities.  First day we prioritized the gate, second day we prioritized caffeine!

Speaking of caffeine, our room included a Kureig coffee maker and was stocked each day with 4 pods. Bring your own if you have a favorite. The ones they give you are pretty good though. 

All in all, we had a very enjoyable stay and we will definitely book there again!

I'll leave you with a note from our 7-year-old. I just asked him what he thought about the hotel and he said:

""It was nice! It was fun! Loved the swimming pool. But the walk to Disneyland was AWESOME!""",Park side rooms are quieter and may provide views of fireworks. Building 1 is renovated.,,5.0,,5.0,5.0,,HojoAnaheimStaff,Guest Relations,2019-07-05,"Hello Amy,

JELGoh,151,"Auckland, New Zealand",2019-06-30,FAMILY,2019-06-30,4,Excellent location for Disneyland!,"My family and I recently stayed for 4 days at HoJo. Check in was very efficient and we were given room 2406 (Building 2). HoJo consists of several different buildings - ours was facing the pool. The grounds were beautifully maintained and clean. They even had a little shop near the main reception which stock drinks, snacks etc. Our room was very spacious and clean. The beds were very comfortable.

They also provided a Keurig coffee maker, a fridge and a safe, which we were very happy with. The air-conditioning was great on a hot day!

Best bit about the hotel is its location. It's only 8 minutes from the main gates of Disneyland and there are plenty of cafes and restaurants within walking distance. The nearest supermarket is about 15-20mins walk away (Walgreen and CVS both at the same intersection). Very convenient.

Reasons why I have not given full marks:
1) They provided paper cups to be used in the room instead of glasses, which become abit of a soggy mess if you try to reuse them.
2) There were 3 of us in the room, but they only provided a tiny tube each of shampoo, conditioner etc.

Room tip: We were next to the motorway but the room sound proofing was pretty good. Can get quite noisy with kids screaming and playing in the pool, so you might want to ask for rooms away from the pool if you want peace and quiet.

Bonus tip: you get fantastic free views of the nightly Disneyland fireworks if you stand at the intersection where Mimi's cafe is (or from Hojo's carpark). 

Overall though, we were pretty happy with our stay at Hojo and would definitely return here if we come back to LA, so, thank you!",,,5.0,,5.0,4.0,,HojoAnaheimStaff,Guest Relations,2019-07-05,"Hello,

We had teenage cousins from out of state visiting and they wanted a day at Disney.  While my daughter, niece and the two cousins went to Disney, I relaxed.  Check in time was 3, but they had a room ready at 8:30 AM!  I was thrilled!  Staff...from front desk to the cleaning ladies....were friendly and helpful.  

The room was clean, had a small fridge, microwave, and two sinks.  There was a small balcony and it was perfect weather for keeping the door open for fresh air.  The grounds were also very well kept.  It’s an easy walk to restaurants and Disney (10 min or less to the security entrance).  While we didn’t use it, the pool and little water park were nice.  There’s also a little market to buy some basics if needed.  

I had to walk to the park to get the girls at midnight.  I felt very safe walking by myself...plenty of people and close by.  

One little perk I really liked...I could sign into my own Netflix account on their tv.

Kerryn L,10,,2019-05-31,FAMILY,2019-06-14,4,Great location,"We chose this hotel on two factors.  Its proximity to Disneyland and the water park for our 5 & 8 year olds.   Both were excellent.  A very short stroll to and from the security checkpoint for Disney and our kids loved the water park.  They did find the water temperature in both the park and swimming pool quite cold though.

The hotel room was dated but immaculate.   Bathroom clean with no mouldy grout.  Beds were very comfortable.   Only criticism would be that it is probably due a decor update.

We were on the second level which required walking up a flight of stairs but this wasn't an issue for us and was made clear at check in.  We arrived before midday and were offered a room immediately which was very appreciated.

No restaurant on site but Mimi's across the street was wonderful and we ate there sometimes twice a day.

Check-in was quick and they even offered balloon swords and cardboard pirate hats for the kiddos. That got my kids super pumped for their stay. The room we stayed in was in building 2 and we were lucky enough to be facing Disneyland so we enjoyed their fireworks show from the comfort of our balcony. The water playground is small, but my kids really enjoyed themselves (all under 7). There is also a pool area separate from the water playground. The beds were super comfy. They offer bunk bed rooms, which might be better for us in the future as a family of 5. We also were able to order dominos pizza and they delivered it to our room. I'm not sure if they always do this or if restaurants familiar with the hotel will only do this, but that was super great since the hotel does not offer room service.

Tiffany O,4,,2019-06-30,FAMILY,2019-06-12,5,Would stay again,"We stayed in building one. All of the staff were friendly when checking in, and helpful. Parking is Free, which is nice ! It’s self park, and fills up fast, but there’s overflow parking at another hotel. 

The beds were comfortable, and they had taken measures to reduce the freeway noise in our room. The balcony window had another widow added at the rail to reduce noise, and it helped. We didn’t hear the cars while sleeping. The balcony’s in our room were not made for lounging and had no chairs. I had expected chairs, but it’s fine. 

Housekeeping was great, even taking time to fold our daughter’s blanket when tidying the room. 

The shower/tub actually looks clean. No grime build up around the drain. The water is finicky in the morning when there are a lot of people using it, but it wasn’t a huge inconvenience. 

The water park is fun for kids. It’s a separate area from the pool, so you have to go back and forth, but we still had a blast at each area. I like that they keep a staff member at the top of the slide to supervise children and remind them of the rules. 

The walk to Disney is relatively quick. We trekked back during the day to let our kids nap, then hit the park again in the evening. 
There are nice blackout curtains in the room, perfect for napping, and we felt like the AC unit worked really well. We kept it at 68, the kids slept perfectly. ",,,,,,,,HojoAnaheimStaff,Guest Relations,2019-06-13,"Hello,

Free parking is a big perk, cute gift shop that can send gifts up to the room for your arrival. Kind and helpful front desk that have killer balloon animal skills. My daughter loved her balloon swords and turtle. The water park was small but fun, and we watched the staff meticulously clean and maintain it in the mornings while we were there. Upgrade to park view top floor if you can, its totally worth it and the fireworks are great from there. Nice well kept grounds. convenient to walk to the park, food, and get on and off highway. 
My only suggestion would be to get a filtered water refill station for water bottle and in room coffee making. Also it would be great to have complimentary coffee with real creamer in the lobby for parents on their way out in the morning. The in room coffee was fine, but I would have loved a quicker option, real creamer, and a way to fill my reusable coffee cup and water bottle on our way to the park.

I was concerned when we first got out of the car about the noise from the highway but as soon as we walked into the building we couldn't hear it any more.  The room was clean and plenty big for us even with a roll-away.  Our room over looked the pool which was nice because the kids wanted to swim and I could watch from the balcony while I unpacked.  My only complaint was the shower, instead of all the water coming out of the shower head, some of it came out the spout below so you didn't get the full water pressure if that makes sense.  I had to call the front desk twice (to ask for the roll-away and then to ask for more towels) and they were so pleasant on the phone and the items arrived promptly.  Every staff member we encountered on the property was very friendly and greeted us.  My daughter was given a balloon sword which she loved.

Brian J,33,"Denver, Colorado",2019-06-30,FAMILY,2019-06-10,5,Great with small kids,"Stayed here for four nights during a family vacation to Disneyland.  We stayed in one of the two room family suites which was perfect for us. The room had been recently updated.  The bunk beds were great for our 2 and 6 year olds. There was a table big enough for easy breakfasts, and a fridge and microwave to help with cooking.  Beds were comfortable.  Had one minor issue with the shower which was promptly fixed by hotel staff.

The water park was great for smaller kids, but older kids might be bored as pretty small slides and shallow water.  The hotel is about a 10 minute walk to the Esplanade between Disneyland and California Adventure.  There are several restaurants along the walk including a Mimi's, Panera, and McDonalds.  We used the Disneyland Resort Express shuttle from the Orange County Airport which drops off and picks up right in front of the hotel.

The hotel staff were friendly and accommodating.  No problems storing bags and with other requests.

We had to change rooms which means we had to pack up and unpack multiple times which took time away from our stay. Having to go through the closet to get to the patio was not easy or pleasant, I banged my head on the hanging shelf at least twice. One of our boys got sick in the middle of the night so we had to request new bedding, housekeeping took 15-20mins to get  us new bedding, of which we were given king sheets for the twin bunk bed, and no comforter, I was told there weren't any available. We had to use the laundry room to wash the clothes he got sick on, we had to go back upstairs since there were no bill changers and to purchase detergent. The rooms were a little small with no dressers to unpack belongings, but the rooms were very clean and the beds were comfy. Although the waterpark wasn't very big our boys (5 and 2) had a blast. They also had a life size chair to take cute pictures and life size chest set in the pool area which i thought was pretty cool. The stay was neither horrible or great, so figured a 3 star was just.

I had been following the hotel’s account t on Instagram and in my head had some sort of idea of what the rooms would look like. Well, scratch that. Apparently they only give the nice, renovated rooms to media influencers. Our room was old. Like, hasn t been touched for decades old. There was a mini fridge and a microwave in the room. Every room has a balcony but no chairs or table are actually on it. We moved the chairs from inside to the balcony. 
The toilet, when flushed, is extremely forceful and loud. My 4 year old refused to flush it because it scared her. Our shower drained painfully slow. I advised staff but nothing seemed to change. 

We just accepted that we paid the high nightly amount for this hotel because it is such a short walk to Disneyland. So that was super handy because we had small children. The walk to Disney passes by a panera and a McDonald’s. 

The kids pool/play area was good. There is a hot tub in that area with pool loungers. There is a second pool area which is just a pool. No hot tub which is disappointing. They do keep these areas clean.",,,,,,,,HojoAnaheimStaff,Guest Relations,2019-06-05,"Hello Lesli,

We were offered an ADA room with bunk beds (all that was available) but that didn’t work since I have twin toddlers and the bunk beds would have posed as a safety risk.

Our family of 3 could never get in a decent shower or get hot water from the tap. The water would run from warm to cold to hot. This would go on for the entire length of our stay which was 8 days. We told management but there was nothing that could be done. They ran the water for a couple minutes and said it was fine. But a 10 minute shower was not enjoyable - warm, then cold, then hot, then back to freezing cold.  I would think a hotel would never run out of hot water, but it felt like they did. This would be a very unsafe situation for younger kids getting scalded. 

Several years ago we stayed at the HOJO and we had no hot water at all. They had to let us shower in another room in another building. It seems like the problems have never been resolved.

However:  a light bulb was burnt out and never replaced after we told them almost as soon as we checked in (5 night stay).

Many facilities and amenities were either shut down or broken or unavailable including the building 1 laundry and games room and the swimming pool.   The large waterslide was monitored but I'm unsure why they bothered as both our kids experienced multiple collisions at the bottom and the attendant constantly sent kids down before the previous child was able to get out of the way.  

Their motto is that they strive for 5 but they weren't striving very hard.  I think they simply don't have to try because they know they'll be busy because of Disney.   It showed.

Andrea D,2,"Carlsbad, California",2019-05-31,FAMILY,2019-05-14,2,"High expectations, but disappointed with service","Let me say the hotel is very adorable and the newly renovated building is cute and upgraded from the looks of it a very 1960s-70s look. We were placed in the 7th floor where there are open windows by ceiling, which you can’t Cover. It’s pretty when you are wide awake, but a big bummer when you have kids and even without kids light comes right in as soon as sunrise. So be mindful of that. My kids woke up as soon as the light came through so that wasn’t very fun. Then as my kids and I were on the floor because kids love the floor we all had a terrible allergic reaction. I asked front desk if there was a dog before and they said dogs aren't allowed in the hotel. I mentioned that your website says pet friendly, but they then recognized that only service animals are allowed. They never did anything to make it right and didn’t even send housekeeping to vacuum so that wasn’t great. Being on the topic about the front desk; when we checked in and went to room I remember speaking to someone on the phone weeks before arriving about we would have liked bunk beds as my kids would have loved that. Girl on phone said no problem. Then I spoke to front desk in person about this and they kept
Insisting I had the most upgraded room and that there are no rooms available with my request so there was nothing that can be done. The lady at the front desk kept giving me reasons why the double beds would be better for my family which was very odd and out of place. With all of these little misunderstandings and not so great service I didn’t understand why anybody didn’t try to make it right. It was an “oh well” attitude. I told the lady at the front desk that I spoke to someone via their IG page about these little requests and she was not very nice saying I have to prove it and show my phone, which is ok for proof, but the attitude behind it was not kind. The rest of the hotel was ok, but for the hefty price tag I expected a ton more! At least good service. Im guessing they only cater to IG influencers who advertise for their property (which worked that’s why I went and tried) but disappointed as the service in this hotel was low quality.",,,,,,,,Hojoanaheim,Director of Sales,2019-05-20,"Thank you so much for leaving your honest review. We sincerely apologize for the service that you have received. I know we have recently spoke about this situation to make sure that this never happens again. You did book through a third party which states the room type and which building you booked in, booking directly through the hotel will have more pictures and details about the room type that you book. We always want to remind our guests, that if they want to guarantee a bunk bed room or a room in building 1(the building that has been recently renovated) they would need to book that specific room type. I see we did give you a free upgrade to the renovated building which put you overlooking Disneyland on the top floor with two queen beds, from the two double beds that you had originally booked. Our bunk bed rooms do book up very far in advance, but I see that the front desk did offer to move you to the bunk bed room when it opened the following day again at no additional upgrade fee. We are not an animal friendly property but we do indeed accept service animals, when there is a service animal staying with us we actually do not allow that room to be occupied for multiple days after to make sure that the carpets are deep cleaned, shampooed and vacuumed so that there is little to no remnants of any animals. We also make sure to vacuum the room in between every single guest who checks out. Again, we sincerely apologize for the service that you have received, and after speaking with the front desk manager this is something that will never happen again. We do hope that you give us another chance in the future, we will be starting a renovation on building 2 in November so that will be even more amazing rooms for you to experience. Thank you for letting us know. ",2

There's pleanty of places to eat on the way to the parks that were affordable and quick! There's also a keurig in the room with good coffee with no lie I did a happy dance when I saw it.

TinyHarms,72,"Mountain View, California",2019-05-31,FAMILY,2019-05-09,4,Location and Water Playground worth it but Service lacking,"I am a little split on my feelings for this hotel.  First off, the location is fantastic if you are interested in walking to the parks.  We walked back and forth to Disneyland/California Adventure multiple times during our stay and it is only about a 10 minute stroll.  We appreciated the free hotel parking, especially when other hotels seem to charge about what Disney does - $25/day.  The pool was sufficient and the splash pad/mini water park area was fun for our kids(ages 4 &1).  

We had a bunk bed room with a highway view, which was newly refurbished and clean.  Unfortunately the rooms themselves are much smaller than a typical double bed hotel room so it made it a bit more challenging for a family with strollers/pack n plays/etc to move around.  The hotel also advertised free wi-fi but we were never able to connect to it from our room on the 6th floor. 

My frustrations came from the fact that we arrived at 3pm (after a day of driving) and were obviously anxious to get to our room/relax/go swimming.  Check in is technically 4pm, so we were told our room was definitely not ready yet but to return at 4, when all of their rooms are ‘guaranteed’ ready.  Fair enough, we decided to hang out by the pool until then.  4PM rolls around and we head back to the lobby at 415, only to be told our room isn’t done yet and won’t be for another 10 minutes.  I guess most of my frustration comes from the fact that their didn’t seem to be a sense of urgency for anyone to get our room ready by the claimed guarantee time nor any explanation as to why it still wasn’t ready.  To add to it, when it came time for us to depart 3 days later, I kindly asked to have late check out(an extra hour) and we were denied.  I feel like other hotel chains will go out of their way to make sure the guests are taken care of and satisfied.  

Overall, I thought the amenities and location were decent but the service left a little to be desired.",,,3.0,,5.0,4.0,,HojoAnaheimStaff,Guest Relations,2019-05-15,"Hello,

Outdated","When I booked this hotel I thought I would be getting the modern rooms they picture.  I received an outdated room with dirty tile grout and old carpet peeling from the walls.  I asked guest services if they could move us into another room and said they could not due to being a full house.  Also, the tub plumbing was outdated, which made it very difficult to pull the leveler to turn the shower on.  I had to have my husband pull it every time.  It wasn’t what I had expected.",,,,,,,,Hojoanaheim,Director of Sales,2019-05-07,"Hello, thank you for giving us a try during your recent trip to the Anaheim Resort.

We are going to be starting renovations on building 2 at the end of this year (this will be another 100 rooms that will be renovated). We are disappointed to hear your room did not meet the cleanliness standards that we expect, this is something that we will be bringing to the attention of the executive housekeeper to make sure that this does not happen again.

Talia76,7,"Union City, California",2019-05-31,FAMILY,2019-05-02,4,"Clean, Brightly Lit Remodeled Rooms!","Great experience! Check-in was a breeze. Our room was ready early and the kids got to choose a balloon sword at the front desk as soon as they arrived. Free parking!

We stayed in a recently remodeled ""suite"" that was essentially two adjoining double queen rooms (sleeps 9). The rooms were so nicely done. Clean, light colored modern design with pops of color found in cute vintage-style Disneyland artwork. The lighting in these rooms was fantastic - best I've seen in perhaps any hotel room. Why are hotel rooms always so dark?? It bugs me so much. Well, not the HoJo! Thank you for giving us so many lamps!

The kids in our group loved the splash pad and we parents loved it too because there's a hot tub for adults to sit and chat while the kids splash. Plus there's no deep pool in that area to worry the adults. The lifeguard was friendly with the kids too. I read that there is also a standard pool elsewhere on the property, but we did not check it out.

Close walk to the parks - maybe 10 minutes. Plenty of restaurants within walking distance. Hello, Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles!

The one major downside of this hotel is the noise - bring a white noise machine because in addition to the typical Disney din, Building 1 is located right next to the freeway and it is super loud. The only other noise issues we had were a noisy air conditioner and the rear entrance door on the ground floor of Building 1. The door was slamming loudly throughout the night, adding a very unnecessary racket to an already too noisy environment. Management should be able to fix these issues fairly easily. 

All in all, we really enjoyed our stay and will probably come back.",great light,5.0,5.0,,,,5.0,HojoAnaheimStaff,Guest Relations,2019-05-03,"Hello Talia,

The service you received from the front desk when you called is definitely not acceptable, and we will be sure to address this with the staff to ensure it doesn't happen again. Thank you so much for bringing this to our attention. We also apologize over the housekeeping cart blocking your door. I have forwarded your comment to our executive housekeeper so he can go over this with our housekeeping team to be more aware of where they have the carts in the hallway.

mkemows,95,"Palm Springs, California",2019-04-30,SOLO,2019-04-18,5,Yo Ho A Pirates Suite for me!,"I was going to spend my birthday at Disneyland and decided to spend the night before at the HoJo Anahiem.  When I went online to make a reservation they listed a King room that was a special suite.  I was not able to reserve the room through their web site (more on that later), so I called their reservation line.  Come to find out they have never listed these special rooms online in the past but are now.  Let me tell you about this room!

Located on the top floor of building 1, this room has a great view to the west of Disneyland!  The suite is one bedroom with a king bed and a Pirates of the Caribbean theme.  I had room 701 right on the corner of the building. The living space had a very comfortable leather sofa and a complete dinning table.  There is a small fridge and microwave along with a coffee maker.  HoJo Anaheim has upgraded their flat screen TV's so that you can watch you favorite video app like Netflix or Hulu.  Just sign into your account.  There is a balcony off the living area so you can watch the fireworks or listen to the sounds of the Monorail.  

The bedroom, is spacious with a very comfortable king bed. There is plenty of draw space and another balcony facing Disneyland.  This one is closer to the trees so the view towards the fireworks isn't as good.  The bathroom is roomy with two sinks, a tub with shower.  The water pressure was excellent, along with the towels.

The top floor has a domed ceiling with windows that let in good light during the day.  I was surprised to still hear the freeway that was behind the room, guess it is really hard to get away from that!  The AC was excellent and wasn't noisy at all!  

The staff surprised me with some balloons and a card wishing me a happy birthday awaiting me when I entered the room! Thank you HoJo staff, that was a great surprise and really appreciated!

Keep in mind that if you are a Disneyland Annual Passhold you get a discount on the room and anything you purchase in the little store.  And remember that HoJo has free parking during you stay.  But they do have a new policy that after you check out you will need to pay $20 for parking.  When I mentioned that was new, they did wave mine.

One problem HoJo needs to fix is with their web site as when one uses the code to get an Annual Pass discount in making a reservation, the site always gets an error. 

The remodeled rooms are excellent and as you have no doubt read in other reviews this location is very much within walking distance, even closer than the Disneyland Hotel to the theme park entrance.  With the knowledge of the suite, I will have to give serious thought about staying at the Disney Hotels again as the HoJo has a lower rate than anything one gets at Disney and you get a really special, roomy space!

Thanks for a great stay, HoJo.","If you don&#39;t see the suites online, call as ask for them",4.0,5.0,,5.0,,,HojoAnaheimStaff,Guest Relations,2019-04-22,"Hi,
Thank you so much for taking the time to leave this review for your recent birthday stay. We are thrilled to hear you enjoyed the king suite in building 1 with the Pirates of the Caribbean inspired artwork and Disney view! We are so sorry to hear about the online system. This has been an ongoing issue we've been working with Wyndham to fix. As of right now it is only the AP discount that isn't working. If you want you can always reserve it at the regular room rate and then email or call us to add in the discount. This way the room won't sell out before you have a chance to give us a call. Thank you again for your review. We look forward to your next stay!

Check in was easy and friendly and we stayed in a family room which had a separate king size bed and bathroom and a bunk bed in the lounge with another bathroom which was ideal for privacy for us parents!  
The room was newly decorated and clean with the usual toiletries and a free rubber duck my daughter loved!  The beds were comfy and although the room backed onto the freeway we couldn't hear a thing.
There was a TV in both rooms although only 2 kids channels which was the only downfall.
We did use the splash play area twice which my daughter loved and it was great for her to have some chill out time from Disney. 
There is a small store with lots of snacks and gifts in case you need anything. 
The hotel is only a 5 min walk from Disney and across the road from Mimmies cafe which was ok, and Dennys, McDonalds and Ihop were just by the crossing to walk over to Disney. 
Parking was also easy and free until 3pm the day of check out and check out was 12pm which was good. My daughter wanted extra time in the splash play area so they allowed us to check out at 1pm instead which was great. 
We would definitely stay here again due to the location and having the separate bedroom. ",,,,,,,,HojoAnaheimStaff,Guest Relations,2019-04-17,"Hello,

ArmyFmly,243,"Fort Drum, New York",2019-03-31,FAMILY,2019-04-08,5,Second Stay Better Than The First!,"This was our second stay at the Anaheim HoJo and all I can say is that the renovations make a huge improvement.  We stayed in Building 1 this time which was under renovation last year when we stayed here. We had the “city” view room on the 6th floor, which mean you get a view of the interstate and city, but the soundproofing they installed made the sound virtually unnoticeable. Our children were asleep by the time any fireworks started, so the park view would not have been worth it for us. Our room was bigger than the one we had in building 2 last year and the table and seats were perfect to eat breakfast at for our children.  The beds were comfortable with plenty of space for two adults in one bed.  We had a crib for our toddler, and it was a metal crib, not a pack and play.  He slept fine in it. 
 
The room’s microwave and fridge were excellent amenities because it allowed us to eat breakfast in the room before we headed out really early to the parks. There is a major grocery store less than a mile away to pickup items that you need. The room also has a Keurig brewer and the hotel supplies four K-cups for you to use (per day if you use them, we did!).  No issues with the bathroom or towels either, housekeeping was awesome.  Everyone at this hotel was awesome!  
There are three washing machines and 6+ dryers in the basement of building one (also laundry in building 2).  It is $1.25 to wash and $1 to dry with a mobile app option to pay (yes, I saw it work) and there is laundry soap available for purchase on site. Parking near building 1 is limited, but there is additional parking on the other side of the hotel.  We did not use the pool or waterpark due to the weather and our busy schedule at the parks.  Check in was a breeze and I checked out through the hotel’s TV portfolio channel, which eliminated a stop at the front desk. 

The hotel is a quick less than 10-minute walk to the park gates, get there 30 minutes early to get through security and in line. We learned if you cross the street at the intersection the hotel is located at, you avoid the large crowd of park patrons crossing the road at the intersection directly across from the park.  Numerous restaurants in walking distances in all price ranges and cuisines to fit the pickiest eaters.",,5.0,5.0,,5.0,,,HojoAnaheimStaff,Guest Relations,2019-04-15,"Hello,

The walk to Disney was manageable, but just a little bit too far to walk twice a day...especially since our rooms were the farthest away.  The check-in staff were very nice.  The room itself was fine.  There was a nice balcony and the housekeeping was great.  The water splash pad is definitely for younger children.  The hot tub was horrible.  There were small children constantly splashing and jumping in and were not supervised at all by adults.  I thought maybe it was just a one-day thing, but every time we went to the hot tub, it was always overrun by a swarm of tiny children.  We arrived to the pool one day and had to step over vomit, both on our way in, and on our way out.  Additionally, a sewer pipe apparently burst in the middle of our stay and the hotel smell was intolerable.  We had to leave.  We called the front desk and they told us that they would call someone out.  I know a lot of these things are outside of the hotel's control, but I would definitely stay at a closer hotel to Disneyland next time.  The amenities were not worth the extra cost/walk.",,,,,,,,HojoAnaheimStaff,Guest Relations,2019-04-13,"Hello,

We apologize for the experience you encountered with children in the hot tub and the vomit outside the pool. We always try our best to take care of sanitation issues right away. Because we don't have a lifeguard at the regular pool, we always encourage our guests to let us know if there are any issues so we can take care of it right away. We are disheartened that we were not better able to take care of this for you during your stay. We did have a pipe burst in the middle of the night. We worked quickly to get the plumbing company to come and fix it, but we completely understand the inconvenience of the odor and work that had to be done.

Spent the majority of time out of the room but was always nice to come back to a clean, comfortable room at the end of a long day at the theme parks.

We appreciated the ability to check in early after a long early morning flight from the Midwest.

A great view too of the Matterhorn.  Our room was spacious and light, fridge, coffee machine and hairdryer all provided. The one thing I like, I know it is a small thing, at anytime when you put the bathroom light on there is no sudden ventilator noise, it is quiet, so no wakening up the others in the room.  The staff were excellent, friendly and helpful.  I hired an ECV and was told to bring it into reception at night for them to charge overnight, safe me trying to get it into the lift and into my room.  This was a great help.

The location is great, service was friendly and everything was clean.  The kids really enjoyed the water play area.  However, this hotel is over due for updating.  The rooms and common areas are stuck in the 80’s.  Since the place was packed (spring break), I suspect the ownership is hitting or exceeding their proforma returns and doesn’t feel the need for major capital investment and is opting for the lower price point position in the market.

Our gift shop does sell corkscrews if you wanted to be able to keep one in the room. While we are glad that you have an overall good experience, we are so sorry we fell short of your expectations. We hope you decide to give us another try and allow us the opportunity to better serve you in the future! ",0

The location is perfect and by so many food options from Mimi’s, Panera, McDonald’s, and ihop, which are all along the way to the Disney parks. We walked to the parks each day and it took us 8 minutes to walk from the entrance of parks to our hotel room, which was very convenient. 

The room was very clean and had all the amenities we needed for a family of 4. There was a table and chairs as well. We had no complaints about our room at all. Housekeeping was very thorough and nice. Front desk help was very friendly. 

The kids loved the water park. It was such an added treat for them and they would much rather be at the water park then Disneyland. We even tried the pool out which wasn’t bad either. For the best view of the fireworks either be at the pool or water park at 9:30.

That was probably the worst part of this hotel -- but really that is negligable. Other hotels the other direction are much further away. This hotel has a pool, as well as a large gated splash pad/water slide area. It is ideal for families with young children (perhaps age 9 and younger). There is no free breakfast, but we passed several restaurants on our walk to the parks, including pastries at Mimi's, and options at Panera Bread and McDonalds. Speaking of Mimi's - it's EXCELLENT. It offers a great value and delicious food -- much more affordable than eating in the parks. We really enjoyed our experience there from start to finish, as well as the relaxing atmosphere.

Footprints564702,2,"Greensboro, North Carolina",2019-03-31,BUSINESS,2019-03-18,5,"A Retro feel, and a tie to Disney","I love this hotel! From arrival to departure, everyone I interacted with behind the desk was very helpful and accommodating. I failed to take their names, because all of them are to be commended. 
I do remember the manger, Raphael. He is the one who saved me a bunch of money when renting a mobility scooter. I was going to rent from Disney, but he recommended a company (D R Mobility) that brought me a fantastic scooter to the hotel, which meant I had it EVERYWHERE I went. Renting from Disney restricted me to just the park.
The hotel itself has a Retro/vintage feel, as it should: it opened in 1965, 10 years after Disneyland, and has a rich, interesting history with the park. 
The hotel design was futuristic, as was much of the architecture at that time due to America being in the Space race. 
     My wife and stayed in an oversize double room in one of the 2-story towers, which were originally known as “Casitas”. The room was huge; 2 very comfortable, firm queen beds, plus plenty of open floor space for a rollaway bed, which is tucked away in an open closet along with the iron and ironing board. I used that floor space to park my scooter.
     The bathroom had a very nice retro feel; it was hand-tiled, with mauve colored tiles. There are Jack & Jill sinks; one in the bathroom, and one on the outside, allowing the kids brush their teeth while mom or dad maintains their privacy. That design was standard for many hotels in that era, which I remember as a kid, when we traveled across the country.
     The manger said the rooms in the 2-story towers are due for a remodel. If they are similar to those in the tall tower building, they will maintain their retro look, and their link to Disney.
     Everything about the room and bathroom was spotless when we arrived. We chose not to use maid service while we were there since there was just the two of us, so I cannot comment. Anything I forgot at home, like a toothbrush, was just a phone call away. On our first night, we needed a fan in our room to produce “white noise”. I called at 11:30pm, and the night guy showed up 8 minutes later!
     We weren’t there during pool season, so I cannot comment. I will say we have already booked for next year’s convention, 3 rooms this time. I asked my wife if she wants to try another hotel in the are, and she said “absolutely not”. This was my first year here; she has stayed the past three years, and is very satisfied. Now, so am I!","In the tower, choose the “Fireworks view” for obvious reasons.
In the 2-story, choose rooms away from the pool areas for quieter rooms.",,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,HojoAnaheimStaff,Guest Relations,2019-03-29,"Hello,

Maria C,2,"Victoria, Canada",2019-03-31,FRIENDS,2019-03-16,1,Not informed,"So my friends son was in the hotel pool, like he had been the past 2 days that we were at this hotel.  Today he was kicked out of the pool as he didn't have a wristband.   He came back to the room to tell his father.  His father went to the front desk and he was informed that we need wristbands to be in the pool and that we should have gotten them out first day.  His son again goes out to the pool and again gets called out for a second time as he doesn't have an adult with him.   Ok, you have now publicly called out an 11 year old child 2 times in less than 40 minutes.  He comes back to the room crying as he is embarrassed.  As per their brochure, HoJo states that if you have issues they want you to go and discuss with hotel as they ""strive for 5"".  I go and discuss this with the hotel, stating that i understand the rules of the pool however we were never told any of this upon our arrival.  I'm not upset with the lifeguard doing their job.  I'm upset with the hotel for not doing theirs, as a result they have ruined a child's first Disneyland experience. For if they had provided us with the proper literature and wristbands this could have been avoided.  Their answer was to read the rules that we never received with our incomplete welcome package. Thanks for nothing HOJO.",,,,,,,,HojoAnaheimStaff,Guest Relations,2019-03-18,"Hello Maria,

Thank you for taking the time to leave feedback on your stay. We apologize for the miscommunication regarding the pool features. In order to ensure that all of our guests can fully enjoy the pool and water playground without overcrowding, we do require wristbands in order to make sure only hotel guests are using the pool amenities. We will make sure to discuss with our front desk staff the importance of always issuing wristbands at check in and explaining the wristband rules. For safety, children under 16 have to be under adult supervision (they must be 18 and over in order to supervise other children). There is a pool attendant who monitors the slide, but we don't have a lifeguard which is why children cannot be by themselves. We truly apologize for the inconvenience this may have caused and will use your review to make sure this doesn't happen again in the future.

Check in was really quick and the front desk staff were great. Our room with bunk beds we found to be quite small. While bunk beds may be a treat for our kids, it was likely put there because the room couldn't fit a second queen bed.

Cameron D,2,,2019-01-31,FAMILY,2019-03-12,5,"Awesome family hotel, super convenient to Disneyland","We had one of the 2-bedroom family specific suites.  The room was at the end of the hallway so was quiet.  The door between the two bedrooms kept the noise down, so our younger (early riser) was able to watch some TV while the older one kept sleeping next door. The room had great flat screen TVs (one in each room) that were easy to log into your own Netflix account with.  The housekeeping did a great job while we were out at Disneyland.  The mini fridge was great for stashing a few groceries in (we had Amazon Prime Now deliver to the front desk), and there was a Keurig coffee maker.

The water park pool area was really fun for our 5- and 7-year olds, it seemed like kids up to about 10 years old were still running around having fun.  The other normal pool was a nice option as well.

The only ding I would have on the room was the WiFi connection.  It worked, but it prompted with scary warnings that the certificates were out of date and the connection was not secure.  I got the same result on Kindle tablets and Android phones.  I went ahead and connected anyway, but not the sort of warning you'd want if you were planning to bring your work laptop along with you.

The location and proximity to the main entrance of Disneyland and California Adventure was great.  It was about a 10-min walk to get to the bag check to enter the property.  It was probably the furthest distance we would have wanted for going to the park in the morning, coming back for swimming, then going back for nighttime activities.  We had a stroller to help with tired little legs.

There's a great family friendly restaurant next door, Mimi's Cafe, that has better prices than the IHOP down the street, and they make really good muffins that are included with a lot of the entrees.  And just past the Mimi's, there is Panera and McDonald's.

It is a short walk down Harbor to the east security stations.  It is also nice to stay at a property that doesn't charge their guests for parking.  I don't really know why this is the practice at other hotels in the area, but I'm not going to get into my feeling about that.    Also, the grounds are beautiful, and have a lot of fun things for families to do.  All of the employees are very nice & accommodating.  There's a fun gift shop, and two neat features for family pictures.  Our room was spacious & had an extra roll-away bed in the room.  You are charged an extra $15 per night only if you use it. There was a lot of extra space for our cooler & snacks so we could take care of breakfast in our room.  Here are the negatives: our building had a distinct odor of sewage, and you could kind of smell it in the room.  It was tolerable, but it didn't smell like roses either.

There is no free breakfast but you get free parking if driving.  The front desk staff were all friendly and helpful.

The only complaints is that the free wifi was very spotty for me.  The other is that the towels, while very large were a little rough.  Lastly the room did not have a suitcase rack but the ironing board worked fine in its place.  You can see I'm looking for short comings and this is all I could find.

Our flight was canceled on our final evening, and the hotel staff went out of their way to find a room for us so we would not have to move hotels, which I was incredibly grateful for.
If you stay on the seventh floor I recommend bringing black out eye masks because there are ceiling windows that let in a lot of natural light.  
To the other reviewer’s who complained that there were no fireworks for them to see from their theme park fireworks view, Disney does not have fireworks every night and this is not the fault of the hotel, so it’s not fair to blame them for it. During off-season Disney only has fireworks on weekends. And the view was amazing when there are fireworks. 
It’s about a 10 minute walk to the security gates of Disneyland. Probably about 6 to 8 minutes if you walk really fast.

tahoeshepherds,44,"North Bend, Washington",2019-02-28,FAMILY,2019-02-21,3,Very Mixed Bag,"The Good: The proximity to the Disneyland main entrance is probably the biggest reason you’d want to stay at this hotel. It’s about a 7-8 minute walk to the entrance, even with kids in tow. It was also pretty quiet for being perched right next to the highway. The staff was also very helpful and accommodating (read more below). 

The Not So Good: The sort of retro marriage of 60’s beach decor with IKEA-style furnishings isn’t the most attractive environment I’ve ever seen, but that’s just a small gripe. What knocked this place down for us was opening the door to one of the smallest rooms I have ever seen. Buyer beware, there are rooms in this place that would make a large broom closet seem roomy. I’m not sure if it’s just the bunk-bed rooms or what, but our family of four felt like Harry Potter stuffed under the staircase. In the bathroom you could literally sit on the toilet and turn on the shower with your left hand and the sink faucet with your right. If you’ve ever been on an older cruise ship in one of the cheaper bunks, than you’ll know about what size of room I’m talking about. Even the mini fridge was extra mini, able to hold maybe 4 cans of soda comfortably. After one night in these “cozy” confines we broke down and begged for a bigger room. To the front desk’s credit, they obliged us as soon as they were able and gave us an upgraded room (a normal-sized room) at no extra charge. Had we seen this second room initially, my review may have been kinder, but a night in the “doll house” room at $200 really took some of the luster off of our trip.

The Bottom Line: I truly think most travelers looking to bond with Mickey and friends will find this hotel to be very adequate. At a different stage of my travels, I would have been satisfied with this place. However, having stayed at about 12 other hotels in the area, including some of the Disney properties, my expectations of a hotel have moved beyond the very basic experience that the Howard Johnson offered. It’s not you, Howard, it’s me...there will be no second date.",,,,,,,,HojoAnaheimStaff,Guest Relations,2019-02-28,"Hello,

Stacey S,1,,2019-02-28,FRIENDS,2019-02-20,5,ANOTHER amazing stay....,"This is probably my 9th or 10th time staying at the Anaheim HoJo, and my 2nd visit since the tower 1 remodel last year. We tend to stay in a park facing room with 2 queen beds, but have stayed in almost every building. All the rooms are great, but building 1 is our favorite. The new beds are amazing. The sheets are super soft and great quality. We love being able to check everything out on the balcony each morning. We stayed during Valentine’s Day and came back to candy and a card. The housekeepers took amazing care of us and even left us a towel elephant one day. Room is BIG. Has a nice table with built in seating. There’s a big closet but only 2 drawers. We each took a drawer and were more than fine. The lighting in the bathroom is RESPLENDENT! One of our favorite features. There is tons of counter and cabinet space in the bathroom. Every employee we encountered was wonderful, but we never have any problems so barely interacted with the staff. We always arrive early and they always accommodate us by storing luggage or just checking us in early. Either way they make the whole process super easy. We park when we arrive and never use the car. Walking to and from the parks is less than a 15 minute walk even when we’re exhausted at the end of a full day at the parks. It’s an easy flat walk too. 
This last stay was for 4 nights. Most of our stays are 4 or 5 nights. New things we really like: netflix on the tv makes finding stuff to watch before bed MUCH easier. Now if we can just remember to log out! The rubber duck in the bathroom has become a souvenir. I write the dates of our stay on the bottom. More plugs and usb ports now too. Usb ports on the microwave AND alarm clock were nice bonuses. Already planning our next trip down before summer. This is our go to hotel at Disneyland.

I booked this hotel for its price and location (it doesn't get much better if you are going back and forth to Disneyland), but what my family and I experienced once there was far beyond my expectations. The staff were courteous and helpful, the grounds immaculately kept, and there was ample parking. It was, however, the rooms that really stood out. I think that they had recently renovated the rooms and they did a fantastic job. I was initially concerned that there would be road noise as the property backs up to the highway, but the buildings and rooms did a great job knocking out any noise! Also, good quality all around - comfortable beds, simple and responsive heating and cooling (is it just me or is this a make or break deal?), Smart TVs with the most common Apps (Netflix, Hulu, etc.), and even a remarkably useful table and chairs/stools that made it easy for my family to eat take-out dinner together.

Clean rooms, comfy beds, bathroom with lots of counter space, microwave & fridge. 

I think the only downside was no free breakfast like some hotels offer but that’s not needed for me. 
I liked the free parking way better. 
Parking stalls were tight and not many but we always managed to get the last stall.

While there's no breakfast offered at the hotel, you can easily grab breakfast next door at Mimi's, or just down the block at McDonald's or IHOP.  The pool, hot tub, and kid's water park are all very nice.  Every hotel employee I encountered was great!

Your feedback is greatly appreciated and will help us continue to improve. It is our goal to always address comments and resolve any issues to your satisfaction. We know that one of our front desk supervisors was in contact with your during your stay; we hope that he was able to help with your concerns. 
For sanitary purposes, all of our cups in the room are wrapped in plastic and we provide plastic cutlery complimentary through the gift shop. All of our trash is sent to the city of Anaheim who sorts and processes plastics to recycle. 
We completely understand the inconvenience of having to make one cup of hot water at a time using the Keurig. We do provide hot water kettle rentals through the front desk. We apologize that this was not mentioned to you when you arrived. 
Your comments have also been brought to the attention of our head engineer to inspect the pipes near your room to make that everything is running properly. 
We greatly appreciate you leaving us this feedback in order to improve and ensure that no other guest has a similar experience. We really hope you give us another try and allow us the opportunity to better serve you and your family in the future.

I prefer it over two of the Disney property hotels and quite honestly the only reason the Grand Californian ranks somewhat higher is because of the proximity. Check in is SEAMLESS...where as checkin at the Disney properties rivals applying for a mortgage loan. The hotel is bright and friendly and the rooms are incredibly spacious.

Candace,21,"St. John's, Canada",2019-02-28,FAMILY,2019-02-12,4,Two day family stay,"My mother, son and I stayed here for two nights on a recent trip to Disney. We booked a fireworks view room in building one (most recently renovated building they have). The room was very clean and convenient with a small table for having morning coffee or meals (seating for 4). The advertising was little misleading as we paid quite a bit extra for the fireworks room only to find out there wasn’t any at that time of the year. The front desk manager didn’t offer to refund the difference but I was okay with that since the room was so clean and the location very convenient. We walked to Disney in 10 min or so which was awesome! My son loved the water park area and the other families were very friendly, as was the lifeguard/supervisor.

I was not disappointed! My 4 yr old grandson loved the water park so much more. It was better suited to him. The room was larger, we had an awesome view of the park and fireworks. Beautiful grounds, a quicker walk to the park, and the staff was welcoming and helped us with buying our tickets and informed us of tickets on sale that were less expensive than single days and got us an extra day at the park! We even got to check in early. For half the price of the Disney Hotel we would highly recommend the Howard Johnson! We'll stay there from now on.

Parking is free which is rare around this area. The only negative is no breakfast but it does have a fridge and microwave so I brought my own cereal and milk for my kids. There’s a small gift shop with food items too. The walk to Disneyland is about an 8-10 minute walk. Mimi’s restaurant is across the street and Panera is also nearby. McDonald’s is close by too.

C&R,204,,2019-01-31,FAMILY,2019-01-26,5,Great location and great hotel,"An excellent stay in every way. Whilst checking in, the children were given a toy balloon which helped occupy them.

We booked three rooms in the renovated Building 1 - two kids suites and a double queen. All were great. The 5 and 4 year olds loved the top bunks (younger children on the bottom) and the adults found the beds comfortable too. The rooms were clean and there is an option for an Express Clean before 1pm or a regular room service. One Kids Suite was on the top (7th) floor and it has skylights which make the room bright and cheerful however this can make it difficult to get small children to sleep in. Double glazing on the windows facing the road made the noise levels acceptable.

We were staying to go to DisneyLand and it really is only a short walk. Ten minutes even with small children. The walk is level and easy going and felt safe coming back after dark. 

Staff were friendly and helpful. 

There is no restaurant on site but the recommended restaurant (Mim's Cafe) across the road is convenient and good. There are many choices of family restaurants and take out within walking distance.

Whilst checkout was 10.30, the car park is available through to 3pm (even longer subject to availability and payment of $20) which was helpful. 

One of our party needed a mobility scooter. This was booked through reception with an external provider for $40 per day - much cheaper than inside the Park and can also be used for the trip to and from. 

The water park was enjoyed by the children. It’s heated but not very warm. There is also a hot tub.

 We originally had booked a queen/bunk-bed room for myself, my husband and two of our young adult children.  That turned out to be a mistake as the room was very small, (put a line through the middle of the second bed in a normal 2 queen room and that's where the room ended).  I realized immediately that the room would not work for us, so went back to the check in desk and asked if there was a double queen available.  Not only were we moved to a double queen, but we were upgraded to a higher floor on the opposite side of the building, which had a view of the Matterhorn and the night-time fireworks!  Of course we were lucky that it was the low season, so the room was available.  The hotel also let us leave our car in their parking lot after we checked out, until Disney closed for the day, again probably thanks to off-season.  It was chilly and rainy while we were there, so we  did not use the water-park.","The bunk-bed room is very small.  Mini-fridge was smaller too.

Teresa M,9,,2019-01-31,FAMILY,2019-01-24,5,Perfect for Disneyland Vacation,"We stayed at this hotel for 5 nights for our Disneyland vacation.  It was only about a 10 minute walk to the parks which was perfect for us as we took midday breaks for the little ones to rest.  Easy access to multiple restaraunts nearby.  We stayed in the newly renovated building 1.  Our room was clean, updated, and the beds were very comfortable.  We booked a suite so the little ones had a seperate room with bunk beds to sleep in without us disturbing them.  It was the perfect choice for us! The mini fridge and microwave were a great way to save some money since we could store groceries in the room.  The weather was too cold for us to try out the water park but it looked nice!  My only complaint was the traffic noise from the freeway.  Our room was at the end of the building closest to the 5 so we could hear it.  We did contact the front desk and were offered a different room but decided to use ear plugs and stay where we were.  I will say the later in our trip it got, the less we noticed the noise.  After walking around Disney all day, you sleep pretty soundly.  Every staff interaction was professional and any minor problelms were resolved quickly.  Overall a great place that we would stay at again!  ",Ask to be away from the freeway,,,,,,,HojoAnaheimStaff,Guest Relations,2019-01-31,"Hi,

The location is fabulous - one block down the street from the Disneyland entrance, a 10-minute walk.  I had called the hotel prior to coming to Anaheim and noted that the attitude of the person on the phone was friendly and very helpful.  No bored employees here trying to get you off the phone.  We had asked for a roll-away bed so our daughter (who lives in LA) could join us for a night.  When we arrived, without asking, they just upgraded us to a premium room with two queen beds and a view of Disneyland, at no extra charge and provided her with free parking.  The front desk people had the same attitude as all employees you meet inside Disneyland - they are trained to be extremely friendly, helpful and courteous.  Everyone there including the maids greeted you with a smile. The room was lovely with very comfortable beds.  Across the street is Mimi's Cafe, where we had about four meals during our stay.  Great food and a great selection, and the best option between the hotel and the park on Harbor Blvd.  They are very conveniently open until 11 pm and it's right across the street.  We happened to be visiting the one week out of year when it was raining.  We could see the water playground from our room and were amused every day to see kids playing in it in the rain.

It definitely has a retro feel in the rooms that have yet to be updated, but you can't beat the location. We've stayed at on-park Disneyland properties before and I felt like this place was even closer! 

For the amount of time you actually spend in your room, this place was a great value. Kids love the pool and if you're in the main tower, you can see the fireworks from the park from you balcony. 

This place is most definitely clean. One of the only suggestion I would have is to tone it down on the super-cleaner smell in the hallways.

While the beds were comfy, our room was so so small(one with the bunk beds) and right next to the elevator which kept me up all night as it was noisy. Upon checking in they authorised my card for the full amount which was around $1500aud and then when I checked out they charged the card for the $1500aud so as of right now my credit has both of these transactions on it and I have to wait for the authorisation to drop off. To me this seems like a lot to be holding as most places do a small hold upon arrival. ",,,,,,,,HojoAnaheimStaff,Guest Relations,2019-01-17,"Hello Jodie,

We are so sorry to hear you did not have a wonderful stay with us and for the issues you experienced with the amount authorized. Upon check in we authorize for the full room and tax amount plus an additional $5 per night for the security deposit. Once you are ready to check out we charge the amount on either the same card that was given at check in or we can change the card upon your request. The amount not used gets released on our end immediately. After that it is up to the bank or credit card's policy as to how quickly they release the funds on their end. It can take anywhere from a day to a month to release. Bank cards typically take a little bit longer to release the pending hold. We only process one charge so any additional amount will remain as just a pending hold until it drops off. I do see that we were able to assist you with the authorization on your card. We are happy we were able to assist you. Thank you so much for taking the time to write a review about your recent stay. We really hope you give us another try and allow us the opportunity to better serve you and your family in the future.

The walk to Disneyland was minimal, maybe 10mins at the most. We would also stop at McDonald's for an extra coffee on the way or a treat on the way back.

Your feedback is greatly appreciated and will help us continue to improve. We apologize over any miscommunication regarding the New Years Eve fireworks and the firework views from our property. We do have some rooms where the fireworks can be seen from the balcony. The fireworks are also viewable from our water playground area. Due to high winds, Disney had to cancel the 9pm showing of the New Years Eve fireworks for fire safety. This is something that Disney does not inform neighboring hotels of as they try to wait to see if the weather gets better to allow the fireworks to be performed. They make the official cancellation announcement within the park just before the fireworks are scheduled to go off. They did perform a limited showing of the midnight fireworks but had to cut those short as the winds began to pick back up.

On level 5 in tower 1 and had a great time the renovation is great. 

The down side for us was that we were staying for 15 nights and the lack of drawer storage was difficult but we managed as we know we are one in a few staying that long. 

My son loves his Hojo ducky and a great addition for the kids. The room did feel more spacious by taking out the sink in the room area and putting it in the bathroom but that extra sink also used to come in handy when someone was in the bathroom. 

The new sized fridge was excellent especially the space for the cans loved it!!! 

We love the staff at Hojo nothing was ever a hassle always super friendly! It’s like coming home to us and we have come to know a couple of the staff well.

Our room was ok, the green carpet was really showing its age and was actually torn up a bit by the entrance. The heater rattled which meant using it at night was less than ideal. Also one morning there was a hot water shortage making for a less than satisfying warm shower. On the other hand it was quiet and at least had a working mini fridge. Our kids, 10 and 7, enjoyed the waterpark, although we only went a couple brief times given the weather was quite cool. Overall it wasn’t a terrible experience, nor was it great.

Your feedback is greatly appreciated and will help us continue to improve. We are happy to hear you enjoyed the quiet room and mini fridge, and that your kids had fun at the water playground. Your comments regarding the room are greatly appreciated as we are always looking for ways to improve. We have informed maintenance of the issues you had with the carpet so that they can make sure no other guest has to have the same experience. We are in the planning phase of our next stage of renovations and hope to have all of the rooms renovated soon. 

We sincerely apologize for the lack of hot water you experienced one morning. The hot water boiler in one of our buildings went down and it took a couple hours for the boiler company to come out and repair it. We can definitely understand the inconvenience this may have caused when trying to get ready for your day. Thank you so much for taking the time to write a review about your recent stay.

The not so good: The beds, our biggest complaint is that the beds were not comfortable. 4 nights of sleeping on them and we woke up sore every morning. The crib, its always nice when we don't have to bring a crib with us for our son, but the ones the HoJo had squeaked every time my son moved meaning neither he or us got a good nights sleep.

Culture34529945247,1,,2018-12-31,FAMILY,2018-12-11,4,Great Stay with 1 catch,"This was our 2nd stay at HoJo Anaheim. It was as good if not better than the 1st. Check in was a breeze, staff friendly and helpful. Our room was a King Kids suite. AWESOME ROOM. spacious, clean and great to have separate spaces for the kids, and bunk beds. We ventured through most areas of this hotel---both pool areas, game room, on site store , laundry facilities and the grounds. All were immaculately clean. There always seemed to be staff on the grounds sweeping sidewalks and cleaning up. The on site store is well stocked with small items for snacks, drinks etc to pick up on your way to the parks, but there is no on site restaraunt. The only reason I did not give this a hotel a 5 was our room location.  We changed hotels last minute so we could have a larger suite at the HoJo. Therefore we paid a premium price for the room. It was advertised as ""city view"" when in reality it was facing a very busy freeway with a distant city view in the background. We couldn't enjoy the balcony any time of day due to the noise from traffic and even kept up a few nights due to the noise. This should be advertised to guests when booking. There is also no chairs on the balcony to sit outside even if you wanted to. I would not hesitate to book at this hotel again, but next time I would be sure to confirm which direction room is facing before booking.

Thank you so much for this detailed review of your stay. We are so happy to hear you had an easy check in and enjoyed your kids suite room!

Andrew M,8,,2018-12-31,FAMILY,2018-12-10,5,Excellent Disneyland Family Accomodation,"Really pleased with our 2 night stay at Howard Johnson Anaheim. We were warmly welcomed and very well looked after. The hotel has everything we needed and is right across the road from Disneyland, about a 7 minute walk. We watched the fireworks from our balcony. Brilliant.  I was concerned about traffic noise being so close to the freeway, but double glazing and requesting a room facing away from the freeway (towards Disneyland) there was no traffic noise at all once the balcony door was closed.

Beth Eisler,1,,2018-11-30,COUPLES,2018-12-10,3,Slightly disappointed,"My family has stayed at the hojo every time we have visited Disney, which is almost every 1-2 years. Usually it’s a great stay and we love it. However, this trip seemed a little different. I’ve noticed that the hojo has started to pay more attention to its guests who have an influence on social media rather than their normal guests. If you follow the hojo on social media, you can see that they put a lot of effort into making their social media influencers rooms perfect with extra perks, very clean and they give them priority of the refurbished rooms rather than the regular rooms. My boyfriend and I stayed here this time and got a regular room, it was okay, however we noticed the room would not be properly cleaned and there was hair everywhere, soap, shampoo and conditioner refills were just thrown on the counter, and the lights in our room were constantly flickering. Sheets weren’t even very clean. We even had a housekeeper come in our room while were napping in the afternoon for no good reason. Our check out wasn’t organized at all, felt like 2 seconds and we didn’t get our deposit back for our room, and no reason why, just got pushed out the door it felt like. I feel like if we had a social media influence or we’re going to promote them heavily on social media, we would have been treated better. The hojo says they strive for 5 stars, but they better start putting in the work again. May not stay here again. Start focusing on your regular guests again. Not feeling the love here hojo.",,,,,,,,HojoAnaheimStaff,Guest Relations,2018-12-12,"Hello Beth,

Thank you for taking the time to let us know about your stay. We really appreciate both negative and positive feedback. Our hotel has nearly ten different room types in various categories and in various buildings in order to fit every family's needs. All of our rooms in building 1 have been recently renovated. We are currently planning renovations on building 2 for next year, and hope to have the entire property fully renovated within the next few years. You can always give us a call directly and any of our staff member will be happy to assist you to make sure we get the room that is perfect for you. 

We are so saddened to hear your room did not meet the cleanliness standards we expect. We truly apologize our housekeeping failed to properly take care of your room when cleaning and leaving behind bathroom amenities. This is something we will bring up to our executive housekeeper in order to assure that this does not happen again. After our housekeepers service the rooms, a housekeeping supervisor will go to the room to inspect it to make sure everything is perfect. This may be why a housekeeper came into your room later in the afternoon.

We always strive for improvement and will use your comments to ensure a similar experience is never repeated. If you come back to Anaheim we do hope that you will give us another shot to make sure that we give you the best experience possible.

evmartin123,3,,2018-12-31,FAMILY,2018-12-10,2,Very Disappointed!!!!,"I booked this hotel on Hotels.com     The advertisement pictures looked like brand new rooms.  The rooms looked beautiful; clean, updated, high end.  I paid close to $600 for 2 nights.  When I arrived to the hotel, the room looked like a motel type room, not an upscale hotel that is worth $300 per night.  What a waste of money!

When they asked me how my stay went, I told them I was disappointed.  Then, they told me I should have called and requested the updated room.  I didn't even know that was an option.  Ugh!!!!  I am deeply disappointed and really would want a refund.  I will never stay here again.",Go to another hotel!,,1.0,,4.0,1.0,,HojoAnaheimStaff,Guest Relations,2018-12-11,"Hello,

Mobile40168110358,1,"Phoenix, Arizona",2018-12-31,FAMILY,2018-12-10,5,Hojo - excellent as expected,"This is an older property, but is nestled far enough away from the park to be a ""quiet' space. The grounds are very well kept, the staff is always helpful. It is my hotel of choice for over 20 years when visiting the Disneyland Resort - and for the money it's a great value. Are there more expensive hotels in the area with more bells and whistles? Yes. Are there cheapo places in the area (that you may end up sharing your room with roaches?) Yes. Hojo is right in the middle - large rooms (Bldgs 3,4,5,6) that let you stretch out a bit and allows for a relaxing getaway from the hustle and bustle of the park itself. It will continue to be my first choice when I visit the Mouse. The location is close enough for a quick walk and not much further than other hotels that claim to be across the street. When all thins are compared - it's a nice little hotel in a great spot for the right price. think about this,  even as a passholder, the cost of staying in the Grand Californian for one night pretty much covers my 4 or 5 days stay at Hojo ... and they don't nickel and dime you for parking either!",,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,HojoAnaheimStaff,Guest Relations,2018-12-14,"Hi,

It's close enough to walk, but if your feet are tired its about a 2 minute car ride from the drop off. There are plenty of places to eat nearby and tons of delivery options. 

The room was clean and had plenty of space. Having a microwave and refrigerator was super convenient for planning our meals. The king size bed was one of the most comfortable hotel beds I've had in a while. The pillows were also just right for me. There was a small patio (1st floor) and higher floors had balconies. Depending on the room you have a view of the Disneyland fireworks.

The property was clean. There's a little water park that's great for kids. The staff were also friendly and helpful. The biggest hiccup was really minor. The lady who checked us in forgot to give us a parking permit which we realized our 3rd day there but that was easily fixed.

JJfish,1,,2018-11-30,FAMILY,2018-11-25,4,Recent family vacation,"We just returned from our Disney vacation, where our family of 4 stayed at the Howard Johnson Anaheim Hotel & Water Playground. We stayed in a room in one building and were upgraded to a newer room, so we have good perspective on the accommodations here. 

First of all, the property is ideally located for Disneyland access. It's literally an 8-minute walk from the hotel to the Disney gates. The value here alone for such close park access (and not having to deal with parking or commuting in/around Disney) is undeniable. 

Next, this hotel is terrific for families. It's bright, colourful, and the pool and water park are clean and well maintained. The staff are friendly, and the property is nice. Now, given you're reading & reviewing this hotel, you likely aren't in the market/budget for one of the Disneyland resorts. They are in a different league and price bracket. If you are comparing HoJo with the Grand Californian (located IN the Disney park), then HoJo can't really compare, but bear in mind HoJo is at a significantly reduced price point, but the accommodations are great and the convenience is close to the same. For our family HoJo was an obvious choice, and we weren't disappointed! We'd totally stay here again.

ROOMS:
We read many TripAdvisor reviews to get a sense of the rooms, and for your reading pleasure we're sharing our experience to help others make an informed decision. We stayed in 2 different rooms in 2 different buildings, so we have a good vantage point:
 
The buildings/rooms on the property have notable differences. After reading some room reviews, we booked through a travel agent and specified that we wanted a renovated room on an upper floor with a view of the fireworks. We were told by the travel agent that while there could be 'no guarantees', we'd have our preferences noted. When we arrived, I asked if they received our preferences. The hotel staff were very polite, but said that certain travel agencies only have certain room types (ie: standard vs premium) booked through them. This therefore didn't qualify us for 'premium' rooms. While the new rooms are the ones advertised, be advised that these aren't necessarily the ones you will be assigned!

Our room (the first one assigned) was in building 2, and had a pool/garden view. The room was clean, but quite old and dated (ie: 70s decor). The rooms here have no view of the fireworks. We were comfortable, but disappointed. We spoke with the front desk again, and they were accommodating. They said they'd upgrade us to a newer room in building 1, but only when one opened up 3 days (ie: halfway) into our stay. When moving to our new room on the 4th floor of building 1, the difference was unmistakable. The rooms are modern, renovated, and stylish. The mattresses & pillows are much more comfortable. The AC units are new and quieter. The bathrooms are polished and bright. No question HoJo has invested more in the building 1 tower rooms, and these are considered their 'premium' rooms, especially those facing Disney. They are in a slightly higher pricing tier. However, be aware there are a few tall trees right next to the building 1 tower. We were put in a room right in front of one of the trees, and this completely obstructed our view of the fireworks. Again, disappointing. You can get a view of the fireworks down by the water park or pool areas, but if you want a view of the fireworks from your room, you need to be aware of these considerations. We very much appreciated that the staff made concessions and upgraded us to a room that we had anticipated we would get when booking through the travel agent, but be aware that not all 'premium' rooms will have the view you're hoping for.

Again, this hotel and its staff are great, and we'd highly recommend it especially for families. We came here for Disneyland, so our time spent in the hotel was minimal. However, we did use the pool and water park, and the kids had a blast. The location is incredible, it's right in the heart of the Disney area.

turabiannights,30,"Palo Alto, California",2018-11-30,FAMILY,2018-11-20,5,Even better than expected,"We are Candy Cane Inn enthusiasts who booked a trip last minute and just had to book what we could find on short notice. When I asked my friend ""You've stayed at the Howard Johnson, right? How is it?"", she said, ""Well, you know, it's a Howard Johnson."" I was prepared for an average motel stay, but we had such a great experience that we'd gladly book in here again!

We stayed on the ground floor of building 4, with a balcony looking right out onto the pirate ship at the pool. It was clean, and the beds and pillows were very comfortable. Unlike building 1, building 4 clearly hasn't been redone in decades, but it didn't feel too tired or frayed. It was surprisingly quiet for a family hotel, with the exception of the pirate ship bell ringing all day and into the night -- important to know about if you've got a light sleeper in your party who needs a nap during the day! We did not use the hotel's cribs, choosing instead to bring a small inflatable airbed for our toddler.

The staff were uniformly helpful and cheerful. We had to rent an electric scooter while we were there, and it couldn't have been easier to do through the hotel -- I was so relieved that I didn't have to research all the various rental companies and arrange for delivery myself. They'll even charge the scooter overnight for you, so you don't have to figure out how to get it into your room.

The location was excellent - very quick walk to the park entrance.

Though they do have a convenience shop onsite, it doesn't have a wide food selection. We used the online ordering feature at Mimi's across the street to pick up breakfast to-go before the kid woke up every morning, and that ended up being pretty convenient.",,,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,HojoAnaheimStaff,Howard Johnson,2018-11-28,"Hi!

beachboy381,142,"Honolulu, Hawaii",2018-11-30,FAMILY,2018-11-16,4,Good Convenient Hotel,"My family (kid ages 7 and 10) stayed here in November. We stayed in building one which is the closet to Disneyland. On this trip, we did 1 day at Disneyland, 1 day at California Adventure, 1 day at Universal Studios and 1 day at Knott's Berry Farm.

The room rates are modest and our room (2 queen beds) was nice, clean and spacious. The hotel offers free parking which is nice versus paying $30/day at other nearby hotels. The front desk staff were friendly, free wi-fi (although unsecure) and free access to a MAC and printing in the lobby. There is also a convenience store in the lobby of building one which is convenient but a bit expensive.

It's about a 14 minute casual walk to Disneyland/California Adventure. On the way to the parks in the morning, it's nice that you walk right pass McDonald's and Panera Bread so there are some take-out breakfast options while you wait in line for the parks to open. 

I would definitely consider staying here again. We have stayed at Grand Californian twice in the past, which is expensive but you can't beat the convenience, especially if you have young kids and will be going back and forth to the hotel to take naps. By staying at a disney resort you also stay within the ""disney bubble"" which includes the theme and overall experience. If you still want convenience but want to save money (40%), I'd recommend the Best Western Park Place Inn which is located right across the street from the Disneyland/California Adventure entrance. In looking at the map, it is technically the same walking distance to the main entrance of the parks as the Grand.

We stayed in 2103 which is a back but as far as could tell also,a larger one as we had to full size beds ..table and chairs very welcome as well and a balcony looking toward the swimming  pool ..
It’s a very easy walk to Disneyland and when your 4 day hopper pass runs out there is the freebie fireworks..
The water park is a great hit .our 4-1/2 loved it ..12 noon checkout even let her have an hour or so in the morning

I expected to get one of the older rooms that hadn't been remodeled. To our surprise and delight, we were placed in building 1, room 705. Top floor, park view. We loved watching the fireworks from the balcony. You can also hear the train whistle. The room was spacious and very clean. Loved having the Kuerig in the room.  The only thing we didn't like was the skylight/windows at the ceiling of the room. There were no curtains to shut if you or your child needs a nap during the day. Next time we'll request the 6th floor. Also, it would have been nice to have a screen door to be able too leave sliding glass door open. 

The little store was great. The older lady that worked nights in there was super friendly and helpful. She talked to you like she has known you all your life. I wish I caught her name.

bigpoppazak,3,,2018-11-30,FAMILY,2018-11-10,5,Perfect stay for 11 of us,"We arrived at least 3 hours before check-in hoping that at least one room of three might be available for an early check-in, (we'd just done 14hrs from Sydney, Australia), and all 3 were ready to go.  Trevor checked us all in promptly and provided excellent assistance over the remainder of our 7 night stay.  Between Trevor and Raphael service was always outstanding at reception if we ever needed anything.  The rooms were a great size, and although the rooms are obviously older, they were clean and inviting after such a long flight.  The hotel is located a short distance from the Disneyland's entrance making it easy to get there before the crowds, and to come back for a midday nap before making the most of the quieter evenings.  Right next door is Mimi's Restaurant which has excellent food and service, and a McDonalds down the road for a late night snack on the way back from the parks.  Nice big pool and the Water Park was perfect for our  5 year olds.  (A little too small for the teenagers though).

Each hotel has its “goods” and “bads”, most of which are decent.  But this is the first hotel that has the perfect mixture of what we desire in a family hotel.  
First of all, the rooms are way nicer than most other hotels.  My kids has a great time playing at the water park.  There’s a second pool on the opposite side of the hotel for those wanting a quiet poolside experience.  There is a very well stocked hotel store.  It is a 5 minute walk to Disneyland.  There is a Mimi’s Cafe, Panera Bread, and a McDonalds between DL and the hotel.  
All of these things are great.  Other hotels in the area are nice too.  But what really impressed us and what will keep us coming back is the people who work here.  Everyone was absolutely pleasant and welcoming.  Specifically Rick at the front desk was a big reason for us feeling this way.  Thank you HoJo staff and thank you Rick.

Linda A,9,"Mira Mesa, California",2018-10-31,FAMILY,2018-11-02,5,Love the renovation!,"Everything is so new, it's great! Comfy beds, new bathrooms, new carpet, smart TV, sliding balcony door, microwave, fridge and a Keurig. Perfect. Some of the top floor rooms have skylights at each end of the room, that we love. But if you want your kids to sleep in morning, consider a room without skylights. You can park one car per room but the day you check out you have to pay $20 + tax if you leave your car past 3pm. If you want to save a few bucks and walk less, park over at one of the Disneyland lots. It's $20 and you can take the tram to Downtown Disney or the park entrance, depending on which lot you choose.",,,,,,,,HojoAnaheimStaff,Guest Relations,2018-11-05,"Hi Linda,

It was so nice to walk back after a long day instead of getting into your car and sitting in traffic. The staff was wonderful. We had a slow draining sink in our room and we reported it to the front desk before heading out for the day. When we came back, it was good as new. An elevator broke in our building and before you knew it, they had signs directing us to a service elevator while they worked on the broken one which was fixed in less than an hour. Great staff at check in and in the little store on site. Look for Mary in the store. Possibly the nicest person you’ll ever meet! Great rooms, excellent location, the best service,  a great bargain.

We were in the newly renovated building 1, in Disneyland facing room, very impressive! We were able to watch the fireworks from our room!

Everything was very fresh, bright and clean! We loved the little table with a bench seat, super handy for our girls to eat at. Lovely clean, sparkling bathroom too. After our nap, we went to the pool area and the kids had a ball. They are 5 and 2.5 and this area was perfect for them!

The walk to the park only took 8 minutes, we loved how close it was, especially as we came home for a nap and then back to the park in the afternoon. Also a short work to the Cheesecake Factory (for Australian visitors).

We used the laundry a couple of times too, I love hotels that have this facility, it's always very handy when travelling with kids. We hired a car on the last day, to visit some outlets before our late night flight. Car hire from Alamo was very reasonable for a large SUV. 

There is a Starbucks at the Courtyard across the road, handy for breakfast, there is also a little microwave in the room which we used for popcorn. We also ate at Mimi's and Paneras a few times too.

Staff very friendly, I did find the lobby layout strange, very retro! We will definitely be back!

MrTonga,2,"Discovery Bay, California",2018-10-31,FAMILY,2018-10-30,2,Sleep Deprived,"We were coming from Wyndham Garden Anaheim and heading to Disneyland so we checked-in around noon but no rooms were available (it was before check-in) so we asked to leave our stuff and have it brought to our room once it was available since we wouldn't be back until 1am (We do this often as we travel to Anaheim monthly and it has never been a problem at any other property).  Our son is on a special diet so we had a cooler bag with his food in it and ice packs.  We informed the front desk about the food needing to be put in the refrigerator once the room was available and ice packs in the freezer.  They were very nice and said, ""Sure, no problem.""  When we arrived at the hotel around 1:30am after a long long day at Disneyland, we went to the front desk to get our room keys and headed up to the room...our bags were not in the room.  My husband went back to the front desk and at first they couldn't find our bags because there were unmarked.  There were no carts available at that hour for my husband to use so he had to take two trips to get our bags into our room around 3:30AM.  Once in our room, we realized there was no freezer in the mini fridge and the fridge itself was not that cold and we couldn't find a setting to change the temperature.  Unfortunately, the ice packs had gone bad, along with some of the food for my son.  We asked if there was a freezer anywhere on-site but apparently there's not.  We were in the room across from the ice machine that sounded like it was running water 24/7, extremely loud and disruptive.  There were two lights in our room in the entry way that were on motion sensors that would not turn off.  We called the front desk to inquire if we weren't doing something right and were told that there's a control switch/panel by the table.  There was a plate there but no switch or outlets.  Maintenance was sent up in the morning and confirmed it had not been installed in that room.  SO, for the three nights we were there we were forced to sleep with the lights on and an ice machine constantly running and it completely disturbed our sleep our entire stay...and if we moved, the lights got brighter!  Not a pleasant stay!  Pretty sad considering all we needed the room for was to sleep and shower but were gone most of the day/night.  Also, our phones (Verizon) would NOT work in the room.  We signed-on to the hotel WiFi, which was a pain in itself, to no avail.  We had to leave the room and go outside into a common area to use our phones.  ",,1.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,,,,,3

The very large rooms had an attached storage/bonus space that was perfect for the baby's crib and naps. Less than 10 minute walk to the Disneyland front gate.  The kids used both the elaborate splash pad and the pool but then kids have boundless energy!!!

The room had storage galore, USB outlets for charging, TWO sinks, a small microwave, refrigerator, Keurig coffeemaker --- the list goes one.   At check in the employees actually took time to explain various ideas and the layout and then they asked if you had questions or needed help and the MEANT it. The small store on site had basics for you day at the parks. 

Our room was in one of the four buildings that are two story without an elevator but you can leave your strollers at the """"front garage"""" if you don't want to haul them up the stairs. The rooms were quiet even though the hiway is nearby; the only noise was from Disneyland fireworks which you can see from the property. 

Lots of restaurants within walking distance and we used three different ones for delivery after a long day with Walt and the Mouse. All three are listed on the guide you get from the front desk.  Yes the style lingers from the 60's but the savings on lodging went into Disney items and that is why we were at Anaheim in the first place.

Always welcoming and full of touching compliments.-  The cleanliness was mind blowing.  Every morning I stood, with my coffee,  on my balcony and watched the guys climb a 7 foot ladder and polish the structures of the children's splash park.  I was blown away at the attention to detail.-  The housemaids went to the trouble of collecting my daughters doll's from the floor and tucking them, comfortably, into the bed of the bottom bunk.

Nicole G,8,,2018-10-31,FAMILY,2018-10-24,3,Not the Best,"The building we were in was very old and run down looking. The carpets looked like they had not been vacuumed and the showers looked like something was growing on them. Since we were visiting Disneyland and only planned on being in the room to sleep, we just ignored it. Our building also backed up to a freeway and was incredibly loud all night. Had we known, or been told upon check-in, I would have asked to move to a different building. I would not pay to stay at this hotel again. It was priced very high for what we received and was very disappointing. I would only recommend it if you stayed in one of the renovated buildings, but even then there are hotels that are less expensive and closer to Disneyland.",,,,,,,,HojoAnaheimStaff,Guest Relations,2018-11-05,"Hello Nicole,

The room was great! We stayed in building 1 in a deluxe queen room. We had an awesome view of the Matterhorn. My two year old loved the splash pad area. It was unfortunately a bit cold, but we were there in mid-October. We even loved the artwork in the room (Mickey!). The rubber ducky was a great touch! And free parking!

mkeil535549,1,"Wichita, Kansas",2018-10-31,FAMILY,2018-10-23,4,Nice and clean but small.,"The room was fresh and clean, however it was a tight space when utilizing it for 2 adults and two young kids. We had a highway facing bunk bed room, which the kids loved. The highway noise was blocked out fairly well, but the layout of the room was strange. (Entering the balcony thru the closet?) Needless to say we didn’t mind the strange layout because it kept the kids from playing on the balcony much. The room did not have any drawers so unfortunately the small table and chairs turned in to suitcase stands. This too was not a huge deal for we did not spend much time in the room, but it would have been nice for organization sake. The kids loved the kids pool area, and exploring the grounds. We enjoyed being walking distance to the parks, but on nights that we ended up exploring Downtown Disney we did utilize a paid transportation service to get back to the room for once you are that far over it just made sense to pay for a ride back. We would certainly use this hotel again, for the small little issues didn’t seem like that big of a deal. ",Building 1 bunk bed rooms were a hit with my 5 &amp; 7 y/o!

Anthony H,58,,2018-10-31,FAMILY,2018-10-20,5,Spot on.....,"Perfect location. Very friendly staff. Modern clean rooms. Updated rooms have plenty of USB connection points. You can even use your own Netflix account on your in room tv. 

We had a Disney view room in building one and the fireworks from the balcony was fantastic. 

Water park for children well attended by hotel staff with an additional pool for adults and children in another area of the complex in a tranquil area. 

Plenty of free parking for hotel guests which locks down at about 9 pm each night. 

If you’re not completely mobile you can hire an electric scooter from reception area. 

We usually stay at the Hilton Anaheim however on this visit we’re travelling with our daughter and grandkids so selected Howard Johnson after recommendation And pleased it was suggested. 

Free wifi in room refrigerator coffee machine and microwave in the room.  No restaurant on site but your thongs (flip flops) won’t even get warm walking to one of the close proximity choices of affordable restaurants for breakfast lunch or dinner.

Don’t forget the Walmart superstore is only a $15 taxi ride away for all of your supplies in the one location.

D_Beep,120,"British Columbia, Canada",2018-10-31,FAMILY,2018-10-20,4,A few minor hiccups but otherwise a great stay!,"We chose this hotel after a lot of research and recommendations from friends, and are glad we booked here!  We stayed in building one in a room facing Disneyland 

Pros:
-Nice walking distance to Disney (allow yourself about 15 minutes if walking with small children - also be prepared for lengthy lines at Disney to get through security!!!)
-great water park for kids
-nice garden pool (with lots of shade!)
-in room safe and mini fridge
-large bathroom (perfect for families!)
-express cleaning - option to have your towels changed, garbage emptied, and guaranteed to be done by 1pm!

Cons:
- misinformation provided prior to arrival.  We booked this hotel for 7 people (in 3 rooms).  Back in February we called to ask if there were any adjoining rooms in building 1.  We were told yes, and then about a week before we arrived we called again to reconfirm our request and were told the hotel doesn’t have any adjoining rooms/never did have any.  We also requested that all three rooms be close together and one party ended up two floors above the rest of us.
-theme park views - I read this before on here, the theme park view is really just luck of the draw.  The room that my family ended up with, while it goes face the park, there was next to no view of the park.  We had 3 large trees blocking any Disney view.  While I love trees, I would not have spent the extra money for a theme park view had I known this was the one I would get.  The other two rooms in our party had great views (see Matterhorn, top of sleeping Beauty Castle, etc).  For my family all of this was blocked by trees.
-rooms not ready on time.  We arrived at about 3pm and only one of the three rooms was ready (which was fine as check in is at 4).  However we still had one party without a room well after 4pm.
-lack of space to unpack.  We had to get very creative with where to put clothes as there were not enough drawers/closet space to accommodate our family of 4.

I would definitely stay here again, but highly doubt I would buck up for the “Disney view”.

While dates, the rooms have always been extremely clean and in good repair. For this trip, I opted to stay in Building 1, in one of the renovated Tower Rooms.  The room was beautiful with a neat retro flair, Disney artwork, and beautiful furnishings. These rooms have a great dining area with a bench and stools and their TVs now include Netflix and Hulu platforms. I arrived before check-in time and stopped at the front desk to leave my bags until a room was ready, but was able to get an early check-in. I had one of the top floor rooms with the barrel vaulted skylight.  I know others have complained that they are not able to nap during the day because of the sunlight, but I really liked the skylight. They make the room feel huge! Mary in the gift shop was very helpful and I purchased one of the souvenir HoJo t-shirts and coffee mugs. As always, just a quick walk to the park, free parking (which is becoming more rare on Harbor Blvd), free wifi, and absolutely no resort fee.",,,5.0,,5.0,,5.0,HojoAnaheimStaff,Guest Relations,2018-10-24,"Hello Cristopher,

The bunk beds were within arms reach of the full size bed and made so much noise! I'm not talking a small squeak, I mean nuts and bolts rattling with even the slightest movement. I stuffed paper in any crevice I could find after the first night and it seemed to help a bit at least. It also seems insignificant, but adding a mirror in the room besides the one over the sink in the bathroom would be helpful. With a family all getting ready to go in the morning if one person is in the shower the bathroom is useless, also in part because there was no fan in the bathroom so the mirror would fog up. The location was great, short walk to the parks, but the whole street is lined with other options and we will be exploring one of the other options on our next trip.

Our room was fabulous and seemed like it had been recently refurbished as everything was fresh and modern. The accomodation had two distinct spaces, one with single bunks (and a double pull-out sofa, which we didn't use), and the other with a large (maybe king size) bed for Mum and Dad. Each space had it's own ensuite and large television, which was set-up with easy to access Netflix functionality for downtime between Disney visits.

The pool, spa and water playground spaces were great, as was the on-site shop. All and all the perfect family base for a Disney California trip.

We appreciated Howard Johnson storing our luggage for 6hrs between check-out time and our scheduled shuttle pick-up and found a nice air-conditioned indoor play space at Billy Beez to fill the time but there are plenty of entertainment and dining options within a short walk of the hotel.

MeganLAM,129,California,2018-10-31,FAMILY,2018-10-09,4,Retro ,"Pros- 
Free parking 
Large/Clean Rooms
Some with park views
Friendly staff
Keurig coffee in room
Smart TV w/ Netflix 

Cons-
Loud
Trees in the way of view
Kinda far from park

The pros outweigh the cons, so I may go back. It’s right next to the freeway so if noise bothers you this is not the place for you. I wore earplugs and slept ok. Except for the constant ‘DING’ of the elevator. I didn’t actually hear people so I’m not sure if it dings on it’s own. Annoying. We paid for a premium park view room on the top floor. We got it! Yay! But a tree blocked our view so....
I really don’t mind the walk there. The crosswalk light does take a few minutes, but it’s a busy intersection and no fault of a hotel. There is a Panera on the way to get your morning coffee or pastry (normal pricing). Or you can cross and walk along the park fence. This way is sketch in the dark and not recommended (by me.) I do mind the walk home. After a day at the park, the HoJo seems miles away. I cursed myself at each hotel I passed. 

The water area looks fun for kids. We’ve stayed here a dozen times and have never been in. Too busy at Disney!

I do enjoy the skylights. Yes, the room is bright, but I love the tall ceiling. Makes the room feel bigger. Oh, and a real closet with hangers.

taranelliott,1,"Albuquerque, New Mexico",2018-10-31,FAMILY,2018-10-08,5,Awesome hotel near Disneyland!," We love this hotel. All of the front desk staff were very friendly. The check in process was quick, and the lobby is so cute. It is about a 7 to 10 minute walk to Disneyland, depending on how fast you walk. There are a few restaurants in walking distance including McDonald’s. The room it’s self was really nice. We had two double beds and there was still plenty of room to spread out and walk around.  The decor is really cute and very retro. The room itself was pretty clean I didn’t notice anything of note.  The bed was a little too soft for my liking, but that’s just personal preference. The water playground is something my twins really enjoy. There are three water slides, one bigger one and two little ones. My twins are 9 and so the water park is almost too small for them. There is a big dump bucket that pours out massive amounts of water that the kids all go crazy over. There is also a small pool, a splash pad, and a hot tub. My son has autism and the girls that work the water slide were very kind and understanding (he sometimes has a hard time communicating and waiting his turn). The WiFi is good, not amazing.

Sheri H,294,"Delaware, Ohio",2018-09-30,FAMILY,2018-10-08,3,Way Overrated,"I booked this hotel based on glowing reviews on Trip Advisor.  I felt I had a reasonable expectation of what it was like, but I was quite disappointed in a few things.  

First of all, be sure you know that this hotel has not been renovated and is in a completely different century.  When we entered our building (which has interior corridors), we were greeted by the smells of a poopy diaper/nursing home/cleaning products odor that was there for the whole 4 nights we stayed.  That's just the way it smells.  Fortunately, the room did not smell that bad.  

Secondly, they do not have elevators, which I knew.  But, it did end up being quite a pain when we'd come back after 12 hours at Disney and the kids were sleeping in the double-stroller.  

Third, my biggest complaint is that their ""cribs"" are just awful!!  Do NOT plan to use theirs - bring your own.  I had to request a crib 3 times, after it was originally on our reservation.  After the 2nd call we went to Downtown Disney and got back right at bedtime and it still wasn't there.  This delayed my tired kids getting to bed (not happy about that).  Then, the crib finally arrived.  It was seriously a squeaky metal crib from the '60s.  It was on wheels and every time my daughter breathed it squeaked.  There was no way any of us would sleep a wink like that.  Fortunately, she's two, so I put her on the hideaway bed that was in the closet.  If she was an infant, I don't know what I would've done.  She was able to sleep okay on the hideaway for 4 nights.  There is no excuse to still be using those cribs.  They are in dire need of an upgrade.  Anyhow, upon checkout, there were some additional charges - they charged us $17/night for the hideaway bed!!!!  They said there was a tag on the bed explaining this - there was not.  AND, the only reason we had to use it was because they had no suitable cribs for my toddler (as promised)!  They did reverse the charges, but this is just silly.  

My last complaint is that the first two days our room was not made up.  Again, we came back from 12+ hours at Disney to a messy room.  The second time we came back for a nap around 4:30pm and requested the room be cleaned and it finally was.  Very frustrating that we had to ask for simple services multiple times.  

The only nice thing was the pool and water play area.  My kids enjoyed that.  There are so many nicer hotels closer to Disney that we will definitely look to stay at in the future, though.  I'd think twice before booking here and think critically about some of the positive reviews.",,,2.0,,4.0,,3.0,Hojoanaheim,Guest Relations Manager,2018-10-12,"Thank you for your review Sheri, we really do appreciate it. We completely understand the frustration that you felt when staying with us. We did just complete a large renovation on building 1, and we are currently planning the renovation on building 2 at the beginning of next year which will have about 200 of our 296 rooms renovated. The buildings that you had stayed in will actually be the last building that we are doing the renovation in because this will be the biggest renovation out of all of them. So your feedback on these rooms really is important to us when we start planning this renovation. We try to take every review and make sure we address them in our renovations so we meet our guests needs. Elevators is definitely something that we are taking into consideration on that renovation. If you do come back to stay with us, and we hope that you do, please feel free to let us know if you prefer a ground floor or if you would like one of our hosts at the front desk to assist you with bags. We really want to help in anyway that we can. 

We are sorry to hear about the issue with the crib and the servicing of the rooms. This is something that I will bring to the attention of the Executive Housekeeper to make sure this issue does not happen to anyone else. Again we sincerely apologize about this. As far as the rollaway goes, I am happy to hear that they did reverse the charges does to the inconvenience. 

Thank you for staying with us and we do hope that you give us another chance in the future to make sure you have the best stay possible. Again, thank you for your review, this really does help us to make sure none of these issues happen again for any other guests. ",102

The quality coffee and the Keurig machine were an added bonus. We were charged $17 nightly for the use of a rollaway bed (that was already in the room). When we questioned the front desk at checkout, they stated that there was a tag on the bed regarding the amount of charging per night. There was no tag on the rollaway that was in our our room's closet. I would not have used it if I would have known there was going to be such a high charge per night. That was the only minor downside. The location to restaurants and Disneyland was wonderful.

We had a great view of Disney & the fireworks but that is really where the benefits ended. Whilst the room & facilities were clean & comfortable, the amenities are very basic. This would be ok for a regular room, but we expected a little more for a luxury room than paper cups & no mugs/classes/bowls/cutlery! When I asked at the front desk if I could be  provided with a wine glass I was told to use the shop within the hotel to buy a plastic cup! Australians, NZ'ers & Brits also beware that you are not even provided with a kettle in your room & the tap water tastes awful - you are advised to buy bottled water for tea/coffee. Also, I don't recommend any rooms on the top floor as there are windows that cannot be blocked to prevent being woken by the early morning sun whilst on holidays.","Stick with a basic room, don&#39;t bother upgrading.",,,,,,,CarlaT2171,Guest Relations Manager,2018-10-08,We would like to thank you for sharing your review.

It was very spacious and clean. Everything was updated. The decor was modern and had cute Disney accents. We will definitely be staying here again. The water park was cute and my kids enjoyed it. We didn’t want to leave😊,,,,,,,,,,,,0
Van-Allan78,35,"Vancouver, Canada",2018-09-30,FAMILY,2018-10-04,5,You Want Building 1,"In the past year we have stayed at the Disneyland Grand Californian, Sheraton Park Hotel at the Anaheim Resort and this Howard Johnson. The HJ is the best of the three. It is the most ""Disney"", has the largest basic room, and the best furnishings/layout. It is also the cheapest. All three are about the same walking distance to the park entrances.

First décor. Building 1 is newly renovated and is really nice. The tasteful Disney paintings on the walls and the colour scheme is top notch. It feels like Disney. Unlike the DL Grand Californian which has no Disney feel at all. Building 2 is slated for renovation in 2019 so I can't speak for it. The odd numbered rooms face the park directly. So had a great view of the fireworks every night from our 713 suite.

Next size. What a difference a few extra feet make! All three rooms are laid out in the basic 2 queen bed hotel standard. However the HJ feels much, much larger. The closet works. We travelled with our twin daughters and all the luggage had a place to go. In the DL GC, we had to sit on top of our bags. The Sheraton is average.

Furnishings. HJ gets it exactly right. The TV is brilliant and fast loading. You have instant access to your basic apps (Netflix, Hulu etc) on the main screen as well as regular tv. The resolution of the basic tv in the DL GC was terrible and the number of channels was very small. The Sheraton is plagued by the SPG video system, slow, slow, slow. The fridge is a good size and nice and cold. The microwave is much appreciated as is the coffee maker. Instead of a useless business desk you get a nice bench and breakfast table - awesome. Every hotel should do this. The bathroom has very nice touches.

Next cost. The HJ is a clear winner. There is simply no way to justify the cost of the DL GC. I think the HJ is about 1/3 the cost and is twice the room. As one small example, the parking at the HJ is free - there is a nightly charge at the DL GC and the Sheraton.

Distance to the gates. All three are about the same. The DL GC gets a win for the one direct gate to the California Adventure Park but if you are heading to DL all are a similar walking time. Note that all three are closer to the DL gates than the original Disneyland Hotel.

Extras - there is a great family pool and waterpark as well as a more quiet adult pool. The guest laundry and ice machines are also top notch.",Building 1 odd numbers face the park.,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,,HojoAnaheimStaff,Guest Relations,2019-04-18,"Hi,

The bunkbeds in our room were perfect for our 2 and 4 year olds.  The room itself was immaculate and we loved the view of the fireworks.  The Mickey decor in the room was a nice touch.  As claimed, it truly was only a 10 minute walk to Disneyland security checkpoint (faster if you weren't navigating a double stroller through the crowds).  While we only used the water park one afternoon, our kids really loved it.However, what really sets the HoJo apart is the staff.  Paula at the front desk was an angel.  Our kid got carsick on our ride down and Paula provided me with all the supplies to clean out the carseat and car and sent me up to the room with a menagerie of balloon creatures to cheer up our son.  I also had a great conversation with James who does the pool towels as I was cleaning our laundry in the reasonably-priced laundromat.  And finally Mary at the hotel store is a gem - she made every person in that store smile.

We stayed on the top floor with the skylights and while they do let light in during the day, they didn’t bother us at night.

heyitsfriday,3,,2018-09-30,FAMILY,2018-09-21,5,Perfect Family Hotel,"We loved our stay (family of 5, ages 1-5). Our kids woke up every morning and went on the balcony to see the pirate ship waterpark and Disneyland. We also could see the fireworks at night, plus views of Tomorrowland, Guardians of the Galaxy and the Incredicoaster. My only complaint is that our BOB Double Stroller didn't fit through our room door (maybe it was just randomly our room only?), but we had to unpack it every night and fold it up for the next day. Not enough of a complaint to not stay here again. The kids loved the water park. The walk to Disneyland is very short. They had tons of towels in the bathroom every day (a big deal for a big family!). And everything was updated and clean. A great hotel for families!",Get a Premium Room! The balcony with Disneyland &amp; fireworks views is worth it!,,,,,,,HojoAnaheimStaff,Guest Relations,2019-01-03,"Hi! 

Thank you so much for sharing a review of your stay with us! We are so happy to hear you kids loved the view of the pirate ship and Disneyland in the morning from their room balcony.

Expedia canceled and double charged my account without Notice or my request.  With the assistance of Josh and Veronica, I was able to figure out Expedia’s deceptive error and get my refund for the double charged rooms.  When I had a problem with the Safe battery, Michael came and fixed it with both speed and efficiency.  I never felt like I was an inconvenience and questions were answered respectfully.  
The building, rooms and grounds were clean.  I felt safe walking around and to Disneyland.

Arrived tired from our long flight and staff at check in gave us a room and we were allowed early check in . Newly renovated room too. Then I had an issue with my global card and they called from the front office and fixed the issue . Even my 17year old couldn’t find a shoe in the stores and a staff member Chris helped and we ordered online to the hotel. Another staff member Paula gave me info on makeup to buy and shops to get what I was after. The ladies in the convenience store would ask how your day was and always up beat even at 10.30pm at night . My youngest son is nearly 13yrs old and had no one to play with and after a long Disney day I would take him to the water playground and the girls on duty would acknowledge him by name and make him feel special and this allowed me to chill out . Even though there was a lot of people especially little people staying at the hotel you couldn’t hear anything from our room . Clean and perfect everywhere you look .

BarbaraJVancouverBC,96,,2018-09-30,FAMILY,2018-09-14,2,Would not stay here again: room set-up poor; no recycling in place,"The room we were given was presumably for a  handicapped person - very large walk-in shower and very large bathroom overall.  But there was absolutely no room in the bathroom for even a small toiletry bag.  So you have this huge amount of space, and nowhere to put things down.  Even the hair dryer has to be kept outside the bathroom as there is absolutely no counter space. This was very irritating.  I ended up keeping the hair dryer and toiletries on the floor.

Also there was no nightstand on one side of the bed.  Where do you put your book, phone or other items you would normally put on a nightstand?  Here again i put these things on the floor.

But the worse thing about this hotel is that there is nowhere to put used recyclables.  When you are finished with a can, newspaper, or plastic or glass bottle - where do you put them?  I asked at the front desk several times and was given different answers (which is indicative of there being no policy or system in place).  The most common response was just to put these things in the garbage.  This is a terrible statement from a hotel which claims they want to be a ""5"".  
Sure enough they post a cute little sign in the bathroom ""Save our Planet"" and ask you to save on towel usage.  This obviously is a self-serving way for them to save on cleaning expenses.  If they were truly interested in saving the planet their efforts would be more obvious (e.g. provide recycling bins, provide priority parking for e-vehicles or hybrids, etc. as many hotels do).  
 
It may also be interesting for travellers to know there is NO RESTAURANT at this facility.  

On the positive side, front desk staff were very courteous and helpful.",,,3.0,,3.0,1.0,,CarlaT2171,Guest Relations Manager,2018-09-14,"Thank you for sharing your review, Barbara.

We’ve stayed at many hotels around Disneyland and the Howard Johnson Anaheim always meets our expectations and more.  The grounds are immaculately kept. We love staying in building two. Michael at check-in went above and beyond for us which was greatly appreciated.We needed to print shuttle vouchers and they were happy to oblige with free printing at the Front desk. The free Wi-Fi always works when you are in your room. In the mornings we would watch as the staff would wipe down all the chairs and tables around the pool. They offer express housekeeping which is great for the environment. Everyone (staff) always acknowledged us and said hi as they walked by. Yes it is an older hotel but that is the charm of it. We love the retro feel. We even bought the souvenir  Howard Johnson cups from the gift shop. As others have mentioned it’s a short walk to Disneyland. We ate at Mimi‘s restaurant quite a few times.

Karen_Wash_State,1,"Auburn, Washington",2018-08-31,FAMILY,2018-09-09,5,Front desk was more than acommodating,This hotel felt like we were at Disney. The room was great (we had double queens) and included a table to eat food at. We never heard our neighbors which is surprising for a hotel that has kids.We drove down from WA state with food to snack on. A bag of ice melted in the car on our trip down. We found sugar ants in the car which was a good lesson for what not to do in the future. Ants are attracted to water. The front desk was incredibly helpful with us and taking steps to make sure other guests wouldn't have an issue either.We didn't load the car up until the ants were taken care of. The staff were really great about all of it including being careful with the environment. We never saw an ant on the trip back. I didn't expect they would have been so accommodating. My husband drove to multiple places looking fora  vacuum and couldn't find anything in the area that worked unless it was a detail shop that wanted a lot of money to use a vacuum.This may become a yearly family trip. (Now we know to ensure we have a cooler that doesn't leak for our soda. We had forgotten some frozen waters we had for that purpose.)The splash park is really great for small kids. It was incredibly helpful to cool off during the day.This hotel was recommended from a friend.

Plenty of free parking and a small shop on site where you can purchase snacks, drinks and touristy items.

All of our interactions with the staff was nothing short of excellent.
The kids loved the pool and the water park area -so much so that they wanted to come back from Disney - which is mildly irritating after paying out so much for Disney :-)
Less than 10 min walk to the parks - and a great option (and a lot cheaper) than staying at a Disney Hotel and just as convenient.

Staying at HoJo's, the experience can vary according to which building and which floor you are on.This time, I was on the ground floor in the two storeyed block next to reception (building 3). The room is probably due for refurbishment as unlike other updated hotels, no USB charging points and an antiquated bedside standard lamp. That I could live with, as the primary expectation for any long distance traveler (11 hour flight, plus airport transits, not to mention a huge time difference), can mean 40 hours without sleep before finally getting to bed.To then be in a ground floor room, directly under a family with young children, who seemed to enjoy running up and down the room at 11:30pm, before taking a shower - with noisy plumbing I might add, then presumably parents showering at 12:30 made sleep impossible until very late.Needless to say, as with many young children, running up and down the room with the same heavy footsteps at 6am, didn't help so I was woken up far too early.It isn't the hotel's direct fault, but with many older buildings  - and even some newer ones, sound insulation either from exterior or interior noise severely disturbs the sleep of other guests so two nights this time, both disturbed by heavy footsteps. It could be addressed with room upgrades and decent floor insulation.The staff deserve 5 stars, including the shop staff  and the room replenishment and cleaning team, but despite the location, the water play area etc., without a decent sleep, I just cannot justify the five stars that HoJo's strives for on the basis of this stay.

Itzel R,4,"South Pasadena, California",2018-08-31,FAMILY,2018-08-27,5,Family Getaway!,"We decided to stay at this hotel for my goddaughter’s 2nd bday. We got the 2 bedroom suite for a family of 10. We were kind of taken back when we realized that the 2 bedroom “suite” was actually 2 adjoining rooms. When we booked the room there were no pictures of what this “suite” would look like but we decided to take a chance and just get it since it would accommodate the 10 of us. Also when we arrived we were asked how many parking passes we needed. We told them we needed 4 (some of us got out of work later than others). We were told we would only get 2 free parking passes and the other two we would have to pay $20 a night each. Maybe it was because we booked through a 3rd party but no where did it mention that there was a limit on parking passes. We were also told that the other two cars would have to park across the street at the other hotel. Later at night when the last car arrived another lady at the front desk told us that there was no need for us to park across the street. That they only ask people to do that when their parking is full which she said it had not been. So idk why the other people sent us across the street. Anyways, we got the newly renovated rooms with the Disney design. They were super cute and came with a microwave, Keurig and mini fridge. We even had a balcony. One thing I will mention is that the sheets and pillows had a weird scent. I thought I was the only one that noticed but other family members also mentioned that they had a strange scent. 
All in all we had a great stay. We enjoyed the pool and water park which is great for little ones. At night we could see the Disneyland fireworks from the pool which was a plus. ",,,,,,,,,,,,0

We booked the Kids Suite (bunk bed and pull-out sofa in living room, king bed in bedroom, and 2 bathrooms), and I was SO impressed by everything!  Our Von's grocery delivery order got mixed up, so they delivered before we even checked into the hotel, but staff brought our groceries to our room and put all perishables in the fridge.  Check-in was a breeze.  We had a lot of luggage--while my husband was unloading the car, I was loading it onto a cart; one of the workers saw me struggle and stopped to help.  I tried to tip him afterward, but he wouldn't accept it and told me it was his job--so nice of him!  The room was newly remodeled--very clean, and the king bed was super comfy!  People warned of highway noise, since our room faced the highway in Building 1, but I could barely hear anything.  

The walk to the park was only about 10 minutes--and that's taking into waiting at traffic light, so actual walking time is less.  I felt like the walk was shorter than when we walked from International Gateway at Epcot in Disney World to Beach Club Resort (if this comparison helps any Disney fans).  

We often asked for our room to be cleaned before 1pm because we returned in the afternoon for naps, and our request was always granted.

Our room had a fabulous view of the park and we watched the fireworks from our balcony on many nights of our stay. 

The room was clean and the mickey artwork really made it feel like a Disneyland vacation. The beds, as always, were super comfy. Seriously the one of the most comfortable beds I've slept in. The room was very quiet. We never heard our neighbors beside or above us. The room was light and airy. The blackout curtain on the window allowed us to sleep in when we wanted. The bathroom even came with a brand new rubber ducky that we got to take home! They still have keurig coffee makers in the rooms which is important to me. 

During our stay we used both of the pools. My kids are 11 and 7 and still enjoy the pirate cove kiddie pool area but they're also old enough now that they enjoy swimming in the big pool too.

disneycouple07,85,,2018-08-31,FAMILY,2018-08-21,5,Wonderful time at HOJO,"My family and I had stayed here from 8/4 through 8/10 while visiting California. The rooms are awesome (especially the new rooms in building 1), the grounds are well kept. The pool and water park are a great way to relax and cool off in the middle of the day- and they both offer a great view of the nightly fireworks at Disneyland (9:30pm- the view is better from the water park though). 

The one thing that makes this place stand out is the wonderful staff. From the front desk to room services, everyone is friendly and extremely helpful. 

The location is about a 10-15 minute walk from the front gates of Disneyland- a little tiring at the end of the night, but not terribly distant (and keeps you a bit farther from the traffic closer to the entrance). 

Overall, had a wonderful stay and my girls really enjoyed themselves. Would definitely recommend for anyone- but specifically with families with young children and looking for a great value. 

Also, Mimi’s Cafe (not affiliated with HOJO), is right across the street- great for breakfast, lunch and dinner.

Check in was quick at the front desk.  There was enough parking in the lot and close to the building we were staying at.  Although the building only has 2 elevators we rarely had to wait for one.

The room looked updated.  We had 2 queen beds, a little fridge, a microwave, a table with 2 chairs and bench seating, a safe that could fit my laptop and a office chair.  The room had a balcony that overlooked the water park and Disneyland.  At night we could stand on our balcony and have a clear view of the fireworks.

The resort has 2 pool areas.  1 pool area is the water park which my kids loved.  It had slides, a bucket that tips over water, 0 depth entry pool, splash areas and a spa.  The other pool was a regular swimming pool located on the other side of the property.  There is a gift shop in Building 1 that sells different sundries and souvenirs at reasonable prices.

The hotel does not offer breakfast but there are multiple areas to eat nearby.  We bought cereal, yogurt and other food at Aldi and stored it in the fridge.  The fridge area has storage areas next to it that looks specifically designed to hold cereal and other food.

The resort is a 15 minute walk from the Disneyland entrance.  This was an easy walk for me and my family.  We have a 6, 4 and 1.5 year old.

I will stay here again the next time we go to Disneyland.",,5.0,5.0,,5.0,,,,,,,29

Mary at the Main Street Shop was the sweetest! The shop had a great variety of stuff and was not over priced! Kayla who was working the water park was the best! A kid had an accident and the park was shut down as soon as we got there. Kayla did a great job keeping us informed. I'm sure that's not an easy job as people are so quick to complain over something that is beyond anyone's control! It re opened about 3 hours later. (Not too bad and I am glad they do clean it!) We were able to go to Mimi's for dinner next door that the hotel had given us a coupon for, while we waited for the park to re open. Kayla was great with the kids. She knew every kids name.

Free parking, pool and ten minute walk to Disney. (Whoever says five minutes must speed walk ;)). Great flat screen tv for the kiddos and waterpark is great to cool off. Netflix worked great in room. Store downstairs was convenient for snacks. We got groceries from a local grocery store and used mini fridge to eat breakfast in room to eat breakfast every day before going to the park.

I nearly had her fall down because the door is so heavy to open I was still opening to get threw. the TV is meant to connect to Netflix and YouTube however in my 10 day stay it never worked after several times trying to get a staff member to assist I gave up. the room is alot smaller because the stairwell takes up alot of room. when you have a baby that needs a crib and pushchair it makes the place alot smaller. i dont know why they didnt put me elsewhere considering my mum stayed alone in a big suit 4 doors down and checked in after me. I did ask to move in day 5 and they didnt accommodate at all. I had to check out at 12 and then wait till 4 to check in. they gave me a rubbish room and I had to be inconvenienced with a baby that just doesnt work.
the pirate ship boat waterpark was too dangerous for a 15 month old a bucket filled up with water and then drop onto kids below it would take her out so we never went back. the adult pool is good however needing to use your key card every time is  a nightmare especially since you have to leave to go use the toilet. no toilet facility located in the pool area.
the parking is good plenty of parking. you can tell they are trying to make the place better but it need a but of especially compared to next door.
the house keeping kept leaving clothes behind. 4 times she left the clothes it was annoying.  it's just disappointing I couldn't get my daughters shows on the TV in the morning and they never did anything about it even after I asked multiple times. the room been so small and wouldn't move us was even more annoying. this wasn't a 3 days stay it was 10 days so surely they should of made an effort.

All the rooms have recently been redone and we were very impressed, especially the small details such as a rubber duck and stepping stool in the kids bathroom.   The bathrooms have been redone and are modern and light.   The rooms are spacious and had a Pirates of the Caribbean theme which the children loved.Veronica on reception went out of her way to make us feel welcomed.   We mentioned that we wanted to find a Build a Bear store and she found one in the mall near by, called to make sure of their opening times and provided us with the address - all without us even asking for her help.   The kids water park area is always a big hit and the lifeguards who work by the slides interacted with the kids and were lovely as well as professional.   You are only a 5/10 minute walk from the Disneyland gates as well as several restaurants (Denny's etc).  Parking if free compared to many of the neighbouring hotels who charge you $20 plus dollars which I find ridiculous.

1) Super close to Disney. Walking only 7 minutes or so. On the way there is a great cafe with huge bagel, porridge, etc selection.We ordered online and could be at Disney quite early. 

2) We were in building 1 both times. For our family of 4, we stayed in 1 room. Our rooms in both stays had view on Disney and one can see the fireworks surprisingly well. Our rooms were spacious, super clean and actually quiet. For the price we paid (under 200usd), I thought it was a bargain. 

3) Staff at reception and everywhere else were super friendly (Disney style) and helpful. They went the extra mile when we needed help (storing luggage, receiving packages, needing extra parking, etc. etc.).

4) The balloon art which my kids received was AMAZING. We got turtles which were the cutest balloon art I have yet seen. And one child had incredibles. Kudos to the patient maker of the balloons. We value your art and my kids want to take these on the 11 hour journey :) 

5) We were on last day at the pirate area for a full day. For my 5-6 year olds it was super fun.

The grounds were kept nice and was a nice place to stroll in the late afternoon when the sun was setting.

There was a small shop on site, which sold everything from basic food to beer and the papers were free, Staff were always nice and happy to assist. There were washers and dryers on site which were available at a small cost, however there was no restaurant on site but PLENTY of restaurants within a few minutes walk.

Disney was just a 5 to 10 minute walk down the straight flat road but Disney also had shuttle busses that went past your door. When you google the hotel it shows the Santa Ane Freeway right next door but we heard very little and had no impact on us at all. The fireworks from Disney each night we did have a view of from the hotel (depends on the room you have) so if you want an early night just be aware of the fireworks around 9pm, they are loud !!!

They kids had a games room and there was plenty of free parking at the hotel. Plenty of restaurants just across the road including McDonalds, IHOP, Dennys, Tony Romas and many more.

SarahWent,76,"Santa Rosa, California",2018-06-30,FAMILY,2018-08-06,4,"5 Stars for Staff, 3 Stars for Property","My husband, his parents, and his uncle and I all stayed at the Howard Johnson Anaheim across 3 rooms. My in-laws and I have stayed in several hotels within walking distance of Disneyland, and I know this was their least favorite. It's probably mine as well, although I didn't dislike my stay here; the rooms just weren't as nice as other nearby properties we've stayed at. We actually had the opportunity to stay in both an old room and a renovated room. The old room was very spacious with a nice balcony and lots of counter space surrounding the double sinks in the bathroom. There was a big dresser, and lots of mirrors, which is helpful when getting ready in the morning. That being said, the room was very old and the furnishings looked as though they had not been updated since the 90's. Things were clean, but quite worn. One afternoon we came back to the room for a nap and the entire floor of the building including our room smelled overwhelmingly of rotten eggs. The staff handled the situation really well and quickly had us moved to a different room. They went above and beyond to make sure that the transition happened quickly. This room was in an updated building. It was incredibly cute, decorated playfully in a midcentury modern style that compliments the architecture of the property. However, the room itself wasn't very practical. There were no drawers, only one sink with only a few inches of counter space, and no mirror other than the one above the sink.

Distance to the parks was good, it was about a ten minute walk. There are restaurants between the hotel and Disneyland that are convenient for breakfast. Would I stay here again? If my go-to hotels were booked, sure. The rooms served their purpose even if we weren't impressed with either room we were in. The staff, on the other hand, was consistently great from check-in, through our room change, and upon check-out.",,3.0,5.0,3.0,,,,,,,,71

This stay was by far one of the best! We stayed at this hotel for a total of 9 days for a family trip to Disneyland, and the surrounding area, in June. Our room was in building 1, on the top floor, facing Disneyland. The room was very clean and the bedding was so nice after a full day at Disneyland. The large room fit our family of five comfortably, with a roll away bed. The table with bench seat and two padded stools worked great for eating our breakfast, and the sunny balcony was an amazing added bonus! While there’s no breakfast provided by the hotel, we just planned ahead and utilized the mini fridge and microwave to make our own each morning before heading to the parks. We also allowed ourselves some time to enjoy the pool on this trip. The garden pool was quite lovely, as were the comfy lounge chairs along the side of the pool. The front desk staff were all very friendly and helpful every time we communicated with them. They even went out of their way for us when, near the end of our vacation, our son got sick and we had to postpone our last day in Disneyland. We asked at the front desk if there was any way to extend our stay by one night. The hotel was completely booked, and it looked like we may have to move to another room, or possibly even to another hotel. However, the front desk staff and supervisor were able to keep us in our same room to finish out our vacation! Such a gift, and we were truly thankful!! We would definitely stay here again, and recommend it to anyone traveling to the Disneyland area.",,,,,,,,,,,,2

Room was renovated to a high standard with lots of Disney touches . 

Extremely helpful check in staff - they arranged to look after our bags overnight when we stayed at the Grand Californian Hotel , to save taking everything with us . 

When we checked back in for the second night , it was in a normal room which hadn’t yet been renovated , but it was ideal for a one night stay prior to the drive to Vegas . Front desk even bought our bags from left luggage to our room .

The room was very clean and comfortable. Pretty spacious for a family of 4. We found a roll-away bed in the closet and used it for extra sleeping space for our children. However, we didn't know that use came with any extra cost. Thankfully, the front counter staff waived the charges especially since we didn't see any tags alerting us to extra charges. The water park is good for younger children. My 12 year old became bored easily with the area. Our 8 year old loved it!!! Both the pool and the waterpark area were well maintained.

The room was recently renovated and was very clean. It had a fridge and keurig which came with 4 wolfgang puck k cups. For a coffee drinker it was a nice perk! The hotel was very kid friendly with a water park style area for the kids. Our room was in building 1 and faced the freeway but due to the recent soundproofing we didn't hear any noise. 

All of the staff was friendly and helpful. Anytime I passed an employee I was greeted with a smile. When we had a minor issue regarding extra towels, the housekeeping employee resolved it right away and apologized about 10 times. The front desk also has balloon swords for the kids which was a big hit with my kids. 

I have stayed at all 3 Disney properties with my family and this hotel provided a level of service that exceeded what I experienced there. As someone who has worked in the hotel industry I was very impressed with everything at this hotel. If you are traveling to Disneyland I highly suggest staying here. The price is reasonable for the location which is a shorter walk then Disneyland Hotel and Paradise Pier. There also isn't a charge for parking or a resort fee.

Gary_TLC,160,"Chatswood, Australia",2018-07-31,COUPLES,2018-08-02,3,Wants to be 5 star but lacks the 5 star touch,"This hotel was selected due to the good reviews and location to Disneyland and local restaurants. When you check in the room ""keys"" or plastic key cards tell us they strive for 5 star Tripadvisor status. Yes the staff are friendly and approachable, however the facilities are a big let down. The resort is no doubt family friendly, however there are no bar facilities with any beverages ie beer or wine purchasable at the Resort Market Place. Unfortunately there is nothing to keep it cool and nothing to drink it out of. No fridge in the room required us to get creative and convert a waste bin into an ice bucket with a plastic liner and ice from the machine. Not one glass was available not even a drinking glass in the bathroom for water. It was suggested we drink wine from a paper cup. At least the shop provided some plastic beakers, though no recycling policy adding to the mountains of plastic waste generated.  

If this resort want to be 5 star then they need to think about catering for all guests, including those that might like to relax in their surroundings after a long day in Disneyland

With access to great restaurants within walking distance, and plenty of amenities, it’s sure to meet the needs of even the most demanding family. 

My family has stayed at Howard Johnson in Anaheim for over 30 years.  Our favorite things are the well-kept grounds, amazing pool, and especially the very friendly staff. Over the years, several of them have begun good family friends, and coming to HoJo is like coming home. 

 The hotels waterpark for kids, castaway Cove, as a wonderful little oasis of fun for the youngsters. With several slides, a water shooting turtle, a hot tub, and plenty of lounge chairs for the parents, you’ll be sure to enjoy your experience down there.

We are in building 1 and have two kids (6&8) that enjoyed the water park this afternoon. I was able to find a lounge chair near the water slide without a problem. The remodel makes great use of the space. The bathroom is bright and clean with a gorgeous color scheme. There are two large storage spaces under each sink with a towel rack on both. Our bathroom has double sinks, towel hooks on the back of the door, and a large towel rack above the toilet. The shampoo and conditioner are Matrix brand. In the room there is a microwave, mini fridge, Keurig coffee maker. There is a large two drawer dresser, desk with rolling chair, sofa table under the tv, and an adorable booth with large oval table. Under the tv there are two additional seats for the table, little blue stools. The large closet has many hangers and a safe for locking up valuables. The beds are comfortable and linens are crisp. Four pillows are on each bed. This remodel added a lot of usb plugs as well as many outlets in general. The carpet is soft and the room has a very clean and modern feel. The staff that checked us in was very friendly and welcoming. We walked to downtown Disney tonight and it took about 8 min. On the way you pass Mimi’s, Panera Bread, and McDonalds.

Bri,165,"New York City, New York",2018-07-31,FAMILY,2018-07-27,5,"Clean, Quiet, Convenient","You really cannot beat this hotel for its convenience. It really is a less-than-ten-minute walk to the esplanade between a Disneyland and California Adventure. We arrived at check in after a long ride through the desert (we came from visiting family in Nevada) and were welcomed warmly at the front desk. The hotel was easy to find right off I5 on Harbor Boulevard.  My kids saw the splash park at check in and were begging to hit the water ASAP! They got their wrist bands and my wife took them to play while I checked in. I was extremely impressed with the room. We had a family suite which has a pull out couch and bunk bed in the living room part as well as a king size bed in the other room. Two bathrooms as well. (My kids loved the rubber duck in “their” bathroom! Nice touch!) the rooms were decorated in HoJo Orange and with posters from Disneyland rides. My first impression was WOW! The rooms and bathrooms were spotless. Whomever the housekeeper is on the 5th floor is AMAZING!  Everything was absolutely pristine. We really enjoyed our stay at this hotel. The pool was great. The people were helpful and the room was extremely comfortable. The laundry area in the basement of Building 1 was convenient as well. (And again, spotless! This place really impressed me with how clean all of the public areas and the rooms were.)  Since you’re on Harbor, there are a bunch of food options and there is also a little shop in Building 1 for items as well.  This hotel caters toward families hitting the Disney area, but we found it to be quiet, too. We didn’t hear other guests from our room and their want any noise from the Interstate either.  (They’ve done a unique job of blocking the sound by double paneling in the balconies on the Interstate side of the hotel.)  All in all, we were impressed and enjoyed our time here!

Kjasie,152,"Orlando, Florida",2018-07-31,FAMILY,2018-07-24,4,Fun family getaway! ,"My family and I stayed at the hotel last week for 3 nights and 4 days. I scoured the internet searching for the best place for our family to stay; reasonably priced, little kid friendly, and close to the parks. The rooms were clean, roomy enough for our family of 4, and close walk to Disneyland. 

We liked the kids splash park but pushy older kids whose parents weren’t watching them didn’t leave the best taste in our mouth. Our 4 year old insisted on going daily and it was a nice way to cool off but no way could we sit back. The baby pool was hot and the rest of the water was pretty cold. If only they could add a mild spraying feature to that pool to cool it down.

We were located in building 3 second floor. Beautiful vaulted ceiling that let in tons of light; however, a nightmare at nap time since it was as bright inside as it was outside. There was no way to block out the light. Because of that I give this hotel a 4 out of 5.

Firstly there was no air conditioning running in bedroom on arrival
Inside the building had no air conditioning only in rooms.
It smelt.
And sleeping was an issue as they had windows in the roof that let light in and were unable to close it.
The kids water play area did not have many seats for adults with no shaded areas.

Great points were:
Location was not too far from Disneyland.
You could choose to have your room cleaned before lunch.
Plenty Car parking. 
A second pool area.
Price was reasonable.

Even though our rooms were in different buildings (we booked different categories), they were very close. The rooms were dated but very clean. Only complaint was the hair dryer was a little too hot. The waterpark was just the right size for us and I liked that a staff member was there to make sure the older kids followed the rules. It was a great oasis after a busy day at the parks. Our daughter was weeks shy of 6 years old when we visited and had no problem walking to and from the parks. The staff is wonderful.

Target is down the street and many restaurants also down Harbor to get a late night meal or at anytime. I would have rated this hotel a 5 but...here is why I didn’t.. Don’t get me wrong, service was great and the hotel was a great find but...
1. I like darkness in my room in the morning to help me sleep in and unfortunately on our first night stay we weren’t told that the large yellow portholes are open sun windows...I couldn’t tell because we had checked in late after our Disney visit. But you will see what I’m talking about when you see the top floor rooms with large half moon openings.
2. The entrance to the hotel isn’t on Harbor as you’d expect because of the address, it’s actually on Manchester (Mimi cafe street) at the far end, which I had gone back down Harbor because I thought I had missed the entrance originally. I had to call to get specifics...

Might be petty but a 5 Star is a perfect rating...and this is what I found as my not perfect experience. Other than that everything went great!!",,,,,,,,,,,,2

This hotel is within a 10 minute walk to Disneyland and is well worth the value! Staff is friendly, rooms are spacious and comfortable.

Momof2lilboys,60,,2018-07-31,FAMILY,2018-07-09,4,Good stay for the money,"We live closer to Disneyworld in Florida and have been several times.  We took a family trip to San Diego and decided to take the train to Anaheim for a few days before heading home.  We ended up deciding not to go to the park due to the extreme heat while we were there, but did walk over from the hotel to Downtown Disney (which was weak by the way).  Anyway, staff was very friendly here, rooms are clean, easy walk to Disneyland.  My kids liked the water play feature, but my oldest was borderline too old for it at 11.  There is a Courtyard next door with a bigger slide if you have older kids.  If you have smaller kids though and/or don't plan to be in your room a lot, I would compare this to a value Disney resort in Orlando and would stay again.",,4.0,4.0,,4.0,,,,,,,41

You can’t beat the location. 10min walk and you are through security. The room we had in building 1 had a view of the fireworks from our balcony and was updated and immaculately clean. I had called to confirm what building we were in prior to arriving and mentioned it was my wife’s birthday while we were here. After arriving early in the day they were able to check us in early and even had a balloon bouquet and card awaiting for my wife in the room. The staff are always attentive to your every need. Well done Hojo! We will be back! Fireworks picture from the balcony the first night.,,,,,,,,,,,,43

Lesu A,40,"Denver, Colorado",2018-06-30,FAMILY,2018-07-08,4,"Great location, recommended for family and location","Stayed here for our trip to Disneyland in Bldg 1 which was newly renovated.  Our 7th floor room was next to the elevator and only heard a little of the mechanism, plus our room had a small hallway, so we didn't have to hear people getting on and off.  We were on the freeway side; we could not believe how soundproof the room was, when it was so noisy on the balcony.  The doorway cannot fit a double stroller, so plan on breaking down each time.  

The room was a queen with bunkbeds.  Lots of light!  It was missing the table and we had to ask where it was.  Not a lot of counter space in the bathroom; a shelf would have been great.  The shower curtain was too short, there was water all over the floor every day, hence there was no conserving towels.  Microwave, mini-fridge, Keurig with coffee. 
USBs all over, including the front of the microwave.  The upper bunkbed squeaked with middle of the night kicking.  One drawer in the bedside table.  One lamp on the bedside, would have preferred one on the desk as well.  A couple of shelves in the closet but really, not enough storage/space in the entire room for 4 people, incl 2 kids for 5 days. 
 Luckily, a video of the renovation showed me this, so I brought a hanging closet organizer; life saver.  We put our luggage on the balcony.  We used every inch of space in this room.  We tipped every day and the room was immaculate when we returned.  

No assigned parking and it seemed full but you could always find a spot.  You are given a wristband the wear at the pool; if you cut off, they will give you a new one.  Lots of towels.  The splash pad was really fun for my boys and the hot tub was nice.  Don't know about the adult pool.  Gift shop on the first floor; so over-priced.  You can go to the small balcony at the end of the hallway and watch the fireworks in your pjs.  This location does accept local stroller drop off; we used City Stroller and there was no problem.

Disneyland is literally a couple of blocks away.  Mimi's Cafe is right across the street; excellent muffins.  Then Panera is next, order on your app and it's ready as you come by. 
 Then McDonald's.  There are some other eateries around the crossing to Disneyland, pizza and tacos.  If you have a car, skip ALL of this and either get groceries at Ralph's; 10 minutes away, or go eat at Anaheim Packing House, for a fraction of the downtown Disney prices and the food is much, much better.",,4.0,4.0,,,4.0,,Carla T,Guest Relations Manager,2018-07-08,"Thank you so much for this thorough and thoughtful review, Lesu!

MissKirstsTravels,617,"Sydney, Australia",2018-07-31,FAMILY,2018-07-03,5,Amazing - highly recommended ,"We arrived after a very early morning flight. We tried to book an extra night a few days before we arrived as we realised check in wasn’t until 4pm, however the hotel was fully booked. Upon arrival we we were told no rooms yet available - so we had a nap on some lounges nearby. A lovely staff member came and asked us our name and within 10 minutes we had a room made up for us!

Sooooooo thankful to the lovely staff making this possible. We were absolutely shattered after flying 14 hours with 3 young kids all with little sleep.

Our room was fabulous. Spacious, newly refurbished & immaculately clean. The bathroom was spotless. We could not have faulted the room. Our beds and pillows made for an amazing night sleep.

We were located in building 1 - facing the highway but the windows we double glazed so you couldn’t hear a sound. The only noise we did hear was the 930 and 1030pm fireworks and people running down the corridors late at night after arriving back from Disneyland. It didn’t bother us but if you’re sensitive to sound perhaps request a room at the opposite end of the corridor to the lifts so you will hear less people passing by.

If you were facing the Disneyland side of building 1 - i suspect you would have fabulous views of the fireworks at night, although we just stood downstairs in the car park and had pretty good views.

As far as location goes this hotel is perfect if you have a few days at Disney. It is directly across from Disneyland entrance gates so walking distance probably 10 mins to the gates of Disney.

Lots of places to eat nearby - we ate several times at Mimi’s Cafe which had reasonably priced food, a few days we bought cereal from the store at the bottom of level 1 and ate in our rooms & we also ordered uber eats in a couple of times. 

Facilities of this hotel - pool & waterpark were great. We were so busy with our days at Disney however that we only used the waterpark once during the stay.

Staff at reception helpful and the kids loved the balloon art they would hand out each day! They even tried to assist us when we got stranded one day at Walmart!",,,,,,,,,,,,132

sbjkh,50,"Moranbah, Australia",2018-04-30,FAMILY,2018-07-01,3,Good location but disappointing,"We stayed here for a week while visiting Disneyland and LA.  From our arrival we were let down.  We had booked an extra night so that we could check in straight away after arriving early on an international flight, only to be told that they didn't think we were coming so they had given our room away.  They did accommodate us as soon as they could but that led to another disappointment - men working on the roof making considerable noise.  We weren't made aware that this work was happening and to make matters worse, the men working on the roof could see straight into our room because of the large windows on the ceiling.  This went on for several days before we received a letter under the door advising us of the work that was going on.  A little late really since we'd all ready put up with it for several days.  We were on the second floor and there are no elevators so be prepared to drag your luggage up and down the stairs.  As mentioned before, there is also large windows on the ceiling so the room is very bright much of the day.  There was only two working washing machines whilst we were there so the line up for washing was long.  The swimming pool and the kids splash area were very good and our children enjoyed playing here.  The location of the hotel is good, it's only a ten minute walk to Disneyland so it's very convenient but there are other hotels that are closer.  I wouldn't stay here again.",,1.0,2.0,,,1.0,,Carla T,Guest Relations Manager,2018-07-02,Thank you for your valuable review. We're sorry to hear that you were disappointed in your experience.

Ended up with a bit of a sour taste, or smell since the room literally had somewhat of a sweaty feet stink to it. Got premium room for the fireworks view, but seems I got the worst possible room, lowest of the premium floors and with a tree in front. So my family literally had to squeeze in the farthest corner of the balcony to see any fireworks. Then there was the microwave, which errored out everytime we used it, luckily we didn't have to use it much. Parking was very bad too, but at least it was complimentary. But why are 2 of the 3 exits/entrances blocked off in the morning, 1 of which is permanently blocked off it seems. Water park was nice though and beds were comfy. Just don't bother paying for a premium room, get a regular room instead so you won't feel ripped off.",,,,,,,,Carla T,Guest Relations Manager,2018-06-27,"Hello, and thank you for your review.

We had no hot water for 24 hours and spotty to nonexistent WiFi for the entire 5 night stay and while that may be excusable, the theft of our money is not. Upon check-in, we were told they needed to put a $20 hold on our credit card for incidentals, as our reservation was paid in full months before through our Southwest Airlines package.  Two days later a hold showed up on our card for $930.15, in addition to the $20 hold.  I called the office and was told it was an error in their billing system.  They requested the customer service number from my card, I provided it, and I was assured the charge would be removed.  Two more days go by, the charge is still pending, I call the front desk again and am assured it has been removed, but won’t show on my card statement for up to 5 business days.  It has been another 3 days, we have checked out, and the charge is on our card for $930.15.  We called the front desk and were told they had no record of the prior payment.

He was then told that his Corvette had to be parked at a nearby hotel. The woman at the front desk was rude at the Howard Johnson. We drove the Corvette over to the other hotel and were shocked when the hotel staff began to refuse to allow him to park his own car. This other hotel insisted on trying to Valet his car, to which he naturally declined since it's a classic and nobody drives his car...

We checked in with no issues and our room was in building #2 on the 3rd floor. Elevators are on the slow side. Room was average, shower was not the best. After every shower the floor would be soaked since the shower curtains did not keep the water in. Bathroom needed some kind of ventilation, NO FAN! The AC had to be on anytime we were in the room otherwise it would get very stuffy. The hallways have NO AC it's humid walking in and out of the place. The WIFI was terrible, we only got to use it for a short period of time if it ever worked, signal was terrible. Please fix this!!! Location is walking distance to DL about 10 mins so it wasn't bad, saved us parking. The water park was okay, smaller than I imagined, not enough chairs. Our room was by the second pool (not water park) and it can get loud with kids swimming at all hours. Overall accommodations were fine just terrible WIFI. I don't think our maid ever switched out our ice bags ever. I do like the toiletries (Matrix). Overall if you can get a good rate its worth it, great location.

desktraveller,4,,2018-05-31,FAMILY,2018-06-13,5,Perhaps the best deal in town,"Our young boys (ages just 4 and almost 6) enjoyed their first experience at Disney the week before Memorial Day (May 19-26, 2018).  We weren't sure what to expect from the hotel, especially given the recent reviews citing construction.  However, we liked the fact there was a waterpark and the one-bedroom suite was much cheaper than a similar setup at the Marriott just across the road.  So we decided to go for it, and couldn't have been happier.  A few notes on location, room, amenities and service below. 

Location

- the hotel is definitely walking distance to the parks.  Our kids were able to walk (but like most kids preferred the stroller when they could get it!).  The walk to the gates is no longer than the Disneyland hotel, just in the other direction.

- our room was on the third floor directly overlooking the I-5.  We arrived and immediately thought: oh no.  Then we realized that we couldn't hear the traffic.  At all.  They've done such a good job soundproofing that at night the normal soft hum of the bar fridge actually drowned out any residual traffic noise.  Wow.

Room

- the most recent phase of construction was complete when we arrived.  There was much rejoicing!

- we stayed in a one-bedroom suite in building 1.  The room had been recently renovated and had just about everything that we needed.  The bunk beds were a hit with the kids, and the two bathrooms were a definite plus.  It was also wonderful to have a bit of ""grown up"" space in the bedroom, and the bed was really comfortable.  It seemed like someone put a lot of thought into planning for the updated rooms.

- The upper bunk has a locked safety rail along the open side.  This is a fantastic feature for a room that is aimed specifically at families, and the rail relieved much of our concern about letting our five year old sleep up there (his first time in an upper bunk).

- Unfortunately, the locking pin on the safety rail would rattle a bit when either of the kids moved around.  We mentioned this to management, who were aware of the issue and working on solutions.  This was probably the most negative thing we could say about our entire stay, and it wasn't really a big problem for us.  In fact, it helped us to notice when our kids tried to sneak out of bed in the morning to watch cartoons on Netflix...

Amenities

- Unlike some previous reviewers, we had no problem at all with wifi signal at any time during our stay.

- The TV was set up for Netflix, provided you had your own account (fellow Canadians take note: your Canadian login will allow you to access the much wider programming available on the US netflix site!)

- the waterpark was absolutely perfect for our kids: big enough that they could go and have fun, but small enough that we could keep an eye on them and not feel they had to stay within arms reach.  Probably wouldn't be as engaging for our kids if they were four or five years older.

- Our initial concerns about the lack of a restaurant on premises were unfounded.  There is a wide variety of food within walking distance, and we only repeated at restaurants because we wanted to.

Service

- The staff were universally patient and pleasant, which in itself is not always a guarantee.

- We forgot our nightlight for the kids and on our first night discovered that all the lights are on auto-off timers.  So there was no way to leave a light on in case our top bunk sleeper had to climb down to use the toilet in the middle of the night.  We also found that our kids needed a stool to be able to reach the bathroom faucet.  

- We mentioned this to management on our way out the next morning and they said they would ""see what they could do"".  Usually in our experience this is code for ""sorry, you're out of luck for this stay"".  Imagine our surprise when we came back to the hotel and found a brand-new nightlight plugged in beside the bunks and a shiny new stool waiting in the kid's bathroom.

miship00,26,"Los Angeles, California",2018-06-30,FAMILY,2018-06-06,4,Great toddler friendly water playground!,"Honestly the only reason we booked this hotel was because of the many many many recommendations from other mom friends due to the excellent water slides that were perfect for the littles. Our toddler had the time of his life there, even the biggest slide wasn't too intimidating. The slides could accommodate adults too so you can join your kid in the fun as well. There is no lifeguard but there is always a staff member on the slide apparatus to keep everyone in check. There are towels provided and at the time of our stay there were plenty of lounge chairs and tables. The upper floor rooms are bathed in natural light which makes the space look bigger and brighter thanks to the huge skylights. Beware though, there is no elevator! We dragged our stroller up the stairs and we knew we couldn't do this multiple times a day with a toddler and infant so we requested a ground floor room. I wish this was all discussed up front so we could get squared away from the get go. At first we were told there were no rooms ready yet, then the guy said Wait I found a room. This room was hidden away in a dark corner of the hallway, we couldn't find it initially. The housekeeping guy who helped us couldn't find it either and it seemed like he didn't even know it existed and laughed awkwardly when we found it first. The room was dark and smaller than the others, the shower curtain was falling apart at the top where the rings loop through. Otherwise the room served its purpose but it would've been better if we had more space so we can park our stroller.",,,,,,,,,,,,10

Normally, I'm a picky person when it comes to amenities and such, but I have to say that this hotel was excellent and met our expectations. The room was ready when we arrived after 5pm. Parking is free, so don't worry about parking. Although, you will be given a parking permit so make sure you place it on your dashboard at all times. We stayed in room 110. We did appreciate that it was convenient for us, since we were visiting with our 1-year-old daughter, we tend to hear a lot of noise since we were across from the public restrooms and elevators.

From the moment we started the check-in process to us leaving on day 5, everything was wonderful! First off, I have to start off by saying ALL of the hotel staff was so friendly and helpful, but Paula (front desk) was AMAZING!!! She went above and beyond and would even check up on us daily and give us friendly tips on the area. We were unsure of which room we wanted upon check-in and she so kindly let us tour both rooms and because they had availability, we got to check-in early! Which helped tremendously after flying and busy a commute with our 5 yr. old. The water park was the first spot she wanted to go, and it was a hit! Perfect for all ages of kids! She honestly had a hard time deciding which was more fun: Disneyland or the water park! The staff makes amazing balloon art every morning, so of course our daughter wanted to stop in and get her ""daily balloon"", she looked forward to it every morning, they even surprised her with some amazing balloons in our room while we were at Disney! Not to mention, it's literally less than a ten minute walk to Disney. I would recommend bringing some snacks/groceries to your room, as there isn't breakfast or a restaurant located directly at the hotel. There is a gift shop located in building one that does have food/snacks and drinks, but it is pricey. Mimi's cafe is right next door and McDonald's is a less than 5 minute walk. I hope everyone gives this hotel a try, it won't disappoint! We will definitely stay here again!

Only complaints were the non-existent Wi-Fi -  I tried logging in the first night and it would not work.  I mentioned it to the front desk staff the next morning and they promised to reset it.  Again, still did not work so I gave up.  Also, the TV channels are not what is shown on the on-screen guide, but no big deal - you don't come to Disney to stay in the room  watching TV.

We stayed there for 7 nights and loved everything about the hotel. First of all the staff were all lovely and very helpful. We stated in a standard room in building 2, our room overlooked the pool which was nice. 
The room itself was basic, but very nice. Everything you would ever need when visiting Disneyland. We weren't after a 5 star hotel, we just wanted somewhere clean and modern to sleep at night after exploring Disneyland all day. We got everything we expected, the rooms were a decent size for our family of 5, they were clean and event though the furniture was a bit old, it was comfortable.
I want to pay special note about the beds. I had the best night sleep I've ever had in any hotel in the world. The bed was so soft and comfortable. After very long days of walking around Disneyland, having a comfortable bed was just perfect. Well done to the management that must have paid extra when purchasing the beds, you made my stay so much better, thank you. 
My kids loved having the game machines at the hotel, it was fun for them to spend some quarters one the games. 
The water park in the hotel looked great. We didn't use the water park because we were out at Disneyland, Universal Studios and Lego Land during the days and were only at the hotel at night, but those who are looking for a fun water park, you will love this one.
It was also very convenient to have the washing machines and dryers in each building too. 
From the building where we stayed (building 2) we had a perfect view each night of the fireworks from Disneyland. We all loved the fireworks each night.
In conclusion a modern hotel, but we loved every bit of it, we will definitely stay there for our next visit to Anaheim.","Great family hotel, not 5 star, but everything you&#39;ll need for a reasonably priced Disney Holiday.",,5.0,,,5.0,5.0,,,,,13

Staff was very friendly and accommodating.  The water park was great for kids.  Our 3 year old was in heaven there.  It probably wouldnt be too entertaining for older kids (8 or 9 +).  There is also another pool on the hotel grounds that would be perfect for the older kids, however the hot tub is solely in the water park area.  The pool would be pretty much perfect if it had a hot tub too.  The rooms were spacious and clean and even though the bathrooms were a bit dated they were maintained well, and cleaned thouroughly.  The only thing keeping me from giving the hotel 5 stars is the lack of an onsite restaurant or a complimentary breakfast.  There is a restaurant across the street that is quite good (Mimis) however a table set up with muffins/bagels/pastries for an easy breakfast for hotel guests would have gone a long way. The only other negative was noisy neighbours in the room next to us, however that doesnt affect my rating as it is not something the hotel controls and im sure they would have moved us if i had have askes or mentioned it.

Our room was 709 in building one and it was spotless! They have obviously just completed a reno. There was a little fridge, microwave, coffee, etc. We had breakfast in the room each morning to avoid lines at the local restaurants. 

The cleaning staff were friendly and returned the room to it's original check-in condition every day.

As discussed in the other reviews, the security entrance to the parks is about an eight minute walk. Cross the street near Mimi's if you want to shave off a minute or two)

The pool was clean and there were plenty of towels. The turn-over was fast, so just hang out for a few minutes and a seat will open up if wasn't one when you arrived. We didn't use the spray park, but the kids sounded like they were having fun.

If you are lucky enough to get the top floor with a skylight, take an eye mask to block the early morning sun. We're early risers, so it didn't bother us, but if you like to sleep past six, bring something to cover your eyes.

Again, having stayed on-site at DL several times, your money goes a lot further at the HOJO and we enjoyed our entire stay! A big thank-you to Kriss Sison in reservations for making our daughter's 12th birthday a little more special, and to all of the staff from the front counter to the housekeeping.

I am a Wyndham Gold - should be higher but booked thru a 3rd party & they don’t honor you staying on their premises. 
We are staying 5 nights, in Block 5 room 210 & the noise from the highway is horrific!!! We were given the top floor in 2 story building with no elevator, so you have to lug up all your suitcases & we are a party of 4 - 2 girls 5 & 7 which is on our booking. 
We are in a room where there is a dome roof line  with windows at either end of the dome with no curtains so it is NEVER dark! During the night you have the lighting from outside grounds & as soon as it’s light outside it’s the same inside. Feel like I’m staying in the attic circle in summer. 
Bathroom is the smallest I’ve seen in a hotel to date. 
Room is a good size, tv is modern however no Disney channel for the kids which astounds me as it’s across the road from Disneyland & that is where their primary business comes from. 
The water park was fun but when you come from Australia to go to Disneyland you don’t spend time at the hotel, you just want a good peaceful nights sleep and you definitely DONT get that. The building vibrates with the semi trucks whizzing past 24/7.  I never realized how important having a dark room to sleep was till now. 
I would definitely expect more for the cost & definitely not treated like a Gold Wyndham member.
Recently stayed at Grand Legacy & Fairfield Inn which are closer to Disneyland & would choose them again. Hope this helps as after a huge day at Disneyland you want a good restful night sleep & you won’t get that here.

It’s only a short walk to Disneyland and the pool is great for the kids after a long day in the parks.",,,,,,,,HojoAnaheimStaff,Guest Relations,2019-01-03,"Hi,

Chad P,1,,2018-04-30,FAMILY,2018-05-02,3,"Great location, but dated and lacks quality services","We booked HOJO Anaheim for 8 nights through Disney's Good Neighbor Hotel package with tickets. We liked the fact it had a water park for kids at a reasonable price. We booked for 5 people which the hotel expects to fit in two queen beds... We were able to negotiate a rollaway (which costs $10 a night but was waved), however this made moving around the room when it was down difficult due to lack of space. Also our ticket package was not presented to us on arrival and had to have a Disney booking agent contact the hotel to correct the issue.

HERE ARE THE GOOD POINTS

- Staff was courteous & friendly
- Beds overall were comfortable
- Location to park was convenient

HERE ARE THE BAD POINTS

- Rooms are very dated, and bathrooms are small with very little counter space.
-Drain in shower was very slow as mentioned in other reviews. Backed up in use.
- Furniture is dated,worn, and stained with too many pieces that make the room crowded.
- No gym for people that like to workout while they travel. 24 hour is closest at .6 miles and $15 a day for guests!
- Laundry is dated and only coin operated so bring quarters or get them from game room or front desk. 
- Wi-Fi is free but practically useless. Extremely slow and kicked off often. Bring a cellular hot spot if you have work to do.
- TV's size adaquat, but to not offer the Disney or Disney Jr Channels for kids when your a good neighbor hotel is crazy. Unless I am missing there is a rule against it.
- No restaurant onsite, but Mimi's cafe, Panera, and McDonalds across the street.
- Pools and splash pad are small and very crowded... Usually didn't have a place to sit or lounge due to lack of availability. We went during the slow time of year, so I can't imagine what its like during peak.

Overall we would not stay at this location again. I can see its appeal for the cost, but still not enough to bring us back.",,,3.0,,4.0,2.0,,Carla T,Guest Relations Manager,2018-05-02,"Hi, Chad.

Nice size, refrigerator, microwave, Keurig coffee maker and the pool was right downstairs.

Mimi's is right across the street...Panera right down the street and IHOP is also nearby.  Kids would like the water park.  Their service by their staff was excellent and very courteous and helpful.

Tiffanie B,1,,2018-04-30,FAMILY,2018-04-30,5,Howard Johnson Water Park,"First off, I would like to recognize Paula, the amazing woman that works at the front desk. She is hands down THE MOST accommodating person I have ever had the pleasure of doing business with. She helped us check in, even when my dad, my 5 year old son and I arrived super early completely exhausted after an over night flight from maui. She took her time and showed us around the area and hooked us up with activities we didn’t know existed! So grateful for Paula! Among other things, this hotel is close to Disneyland, has a sundries store on site open till 11, and if there is a wrong they will go above and beyond to make it right. The manager (I think her name is Kira?) is also amazing. Mahalo nui loa guys! We will be back!",,,,,,,,HojoAnaheimStaff,Guest Relations,2019-01-03,"Hello Tiffanie,

theresamarienoble,1,"Olympia, Washington",2018-04-30,FAMILY,2018-04-30,2,"Fine for the price, but I'd suggest elsewhere.","I have stayed at the HOJO - Anaheim a couple of times. The first time was decent for the price and had no complaints really. This time made me decide that I would choose another hotel for my next Disney Trip. 

The hotel, overall, is decent for the price. However, if you are traveling with little ones and have a stroller, you should ask not to be in building 6. We were put in building 6 on the second floor, not realizing this building does not have an elevator. Had I realized this, I would have asked for another room. Having to lug a stroller and a heavy suitcase while trying to herd a toddler for two days was not an enjoyable experience.

The hotel does offer ""free Wi-Fi"" as long as you are ok with it being unsecured. and as long as you are ok with it dropping every 15 minutes and having to reconnect.

It was painfully obvious that the hotel guest book had not been updated with current channel offerings. Channels listed were not the right channel or were not actually part of the channels offered. If you are looking for any Disney channels or Nick Jr, stay somewhere else. the only kid friendly channel was Nickelodeon which only does cartoons in the morning. But if you want 10 different sports channels, this place has you covered!

The bathroom sink and the shower drained VERY slowly, causing us to take quick showers to avoid the tub filling up. 

The room was clean and served its overall need.",,,4.0,3.0,,2.0,,Hojoanaheim,General Manager,2018-05-01,"Dear theresamarienoble:

I apologize that you have experienced a stay when we were not at our best.  We have trained our Front Desk staff to be more aware of our guests' needs at check-in, and to never provide a room for guests with strollers on the 2nd floor of our 2-story Pavilion Buildings.  If something is not right with your room, or it is just not a good fit for you, please contact a Front Desk Supervisor right away so that we can get you something more appropriate.  

We are in the process of upgrading our Wi-Fi throughout the hotel.  The project of installing access points into every room in our 7-story building led to a firmware compatibility issue in the older hardware serving our Pavilion buildings.  Our vendor and I scrambled for a replacement solution which we'll be deploying this week.  We use industry-leading Ruckus Wi-Fi equipment which utilizes ""client isolation"" technology separating guest traffic, and your ""https/ssl"" browsing is always encrypted end-to-end by default, even on ""open"" public Wi-fi.  Our new Enseo TV entertainment system installation is expected to be completed in the next week or so, adding in the Disney Channel, Nick Jr., Netflix streaming and more.  

I hope you'll consider our hotel for your future Disneyland visits.  We are constantly working to provide the best accommodations for families in Anaheim.  Our ""Strive for 5"" program is more than a slogan, it really is a plea to our Guests to let us know if something is not ""just right"" DURING your stay so that we can fix it and allow your family to have a truly delightful, memorable experience.

Thank you for your business and feedback!

Suzancr,36,"Hesperia, California",2018-04-30,FAMILY,2018-04-29,4,Kids suite,"Stayed for 2 nights with our 4 yr old son for our 13th anniversary and a ZZ Top concert. The kids suite is pretty decent. A little privacy with a separate bedroom. Newly renovated. Comfortable beds and plenty of room. Two bathrooms is really nice. Really sad such a nice room has a view of the freeway. We were on the 2nd floor right next to the elevator. Lots of sound proofing exteriorly and no freeway noise. Lots of noise from excited kids very early in the morning from the hallway. Had two balconies but really strange you have to go through a door in the closets to get to them. Wish the bathroom doors could stay open instead of automatically closing. Also sucked that we didn’t have a do not disturb sign. Told housekeeping but never got one. Oh well. Also, the TVs seem like they get Netflix but only goes to guide when you press the Netflix button. Fortunately brought our Firestick. Loved the pirate theme! Not bad for the price. ",,,,,,,,HojoAnaheimStaff,Guest Relations,2019-01-03,"Hi Suzan,

Fred21nym,7,"Phoenix, Arizona",2018-04-30,FAMILY,2018-04-28,3,Average at best no clue how it has so many stars,States here 4/27/18 to go to Disneyland. The only two positives about this hotel are the walk to Disney and it’s half the price of the two hotels right next to it. If you require WiFi on your stay it’s nonexistent here. If you are able to sign on it’s beyond slow and not usable. The decor is very old inside and needs updating. Beds and pillows okay not great. Also it has old school air conditioners they are either on all night long and you freeze or you turn them off no thermostat control.,,,,,,,,Carla T,Guest Relations Manager,2018-04-28,"Thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts with us following your recent stay.

Micic S,1,,2018-04-30,FAMILY,2018-04-26,2,Not impressed...,"We ran into so many issues and staff that preferred to ignore the issue than assist. The wifi sucks. I was told to contact support and they didn't fix anything. The fridge froze all of our food and drink, solid, on the lowest setting. We were in building 2 with a horrible "" arcade""... attractive to the kids, but just took the money.  The store charges so much, more than the other hotels. It is at the end, very close to the fireworks and farthest away from the restaurants. The splash park entertained my 7 and 9 year olds for about 5 minutes. Thank goodness they had another pool. Room was standard. Nothing fancy but functional.",,,,,,,,Carla T,Guest Relations Manager,2018-04-27,We would like to thank you for sharing your valuable feedback with us.

Jeccat,22,"Basel, Switzerland",2018-04-30,FAMILY,2018-04-22,4,Well located family hotel for a trip to disney,"We stayed here with my 5 yo twins for a trip to Disney and were pleased with the choice. As advertised, it is a short walk to Disney (although the ten minute walk felt longer with two wilting kindergarteners in the afternoon sun), and 1/3 the price of the Disneyland hotels. The room has been relatively recently renovated and was very clean, the climate control in the room was modern and quiet, and the pirate-themed splash playground was fun for the kids. I also liked that our room had a little table with a bench and two stools, which we used to eat breakfast together before a day at the park. Four stars only because the splash playground is separate from the pool area— made it hard to truck back and forth, and kids much older than mine would get bored quickly— and the gift shop, the only source of food on premises, was crazy overpriced. However, we got to-go food from Mimi’s cafe across the street on a couple of days, which was great.",,,,,,,,HojoAnaheimStaff,Guest Relations,2019-01-03,"Hello Jeccat,

The main pool however does not have bathrooms and did not seem to have any hot water for the showers. It was also quite dirty by the end of the day (pool deck, tables and pool itself).
