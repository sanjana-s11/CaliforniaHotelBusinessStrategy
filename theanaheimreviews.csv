Desiree J,1,,2021-11-30,FAMILY,2021-11-29,5,Leo is a saint,"Leo was so sweet and caring . He spotted my dad coming out of of our car in the handicap parking with his cane . We were just coming to do the day parking instead of my dad  walking to Disneyland from Mickey ands friends thru the tram . The distance to Disneyland was not that far from the entrance to Disney .  But in since Leo spotted us and he told us that he is able to get us a scooter right away where my dad does not have to walk from the hotel all the way to the guest services to get a scooter. He was great and so nice , he called it in . The scooter was so much more cheaper than Disneylands price and he can take it in the park , out of the park and back to the hotel . If it wasnâ€™t for leo my dad would have to strain his leg . The anahiem hotel had great service .

Desiree J,1,,2021-11-30,FAMILY,2021-11-29,5,Leo is a saint,"Leo was so sweet and caring . He spotted my dad coming out of of our car in the handicap parking with his cane . We were just coming to do the day parking instead of my dad  walking to Disneyland from Mickey ands friends thru the tram . The distance to Disneyland was not that far from the entrance to Disney .  But in since Leo spotted us and he told us that he is able to get us a scooter right away where my dad does not have to walk from the hotel all the way to the guest services to get a scooter. He was great and so nice , he called it in . The scooter was so much more cheaper than Disneylands price and he can take it in the park , out of the park and back to the hotel . If it wasnâ€™t for leo my dad would have to strain his leg . The anahiem hotel had great service .

We were just coming to do the day parking instead of my dad  walking to Disneyland from Mickey ands friends thru the tram . The distance to Disneyland was not that far from the entrance to Disney .  But in since Leo spotted us and he told us that he is able to get us a scooter right away where my dad does not have to walk from the hotel all the way to the guest services to get a scooter. He was great and so nice , he called it in . The scooter was so much more cheaper than Disneylands price and he can take it in the park , out of the park and back to the hotel .

Desiree J,1,,2021-11-30,FAMILY,2021-11-29,5,Leo is a saint,"Leo was so sweet and caring . He spotted my dad coming out of of our car in the handicap parking with his cane . We were just coming to do the day parking instead of my dad  walking to Disneyland from Mickey ands friends thru the tram . The distance to Disneyland was not that far from the entrance to Disney .  But in since Leo spotted us and he told us that he is able to get us a scooter right away where my dad does not have to walk from the hotel all the way to the guest services to get a scooter. He was great and so nice , he called it in . The scooter was so much more cheaper than Disneylands price and he can take it in the park , out of the park and back to the hotel . If it wasnâ€™t for leo my dad would have to strain his leg . The anahiem hotel had great service .

Desiree J,1,,2021-11-30,FAMILY,2021-11-29,5,Leo is a saint,"Leo was so sweet and caring . He spotted my dad coming out of of our car in the handicap parking with his cane . We were just coming to do the day parking instead of my dad  walking to Disneyland from Mickey ands friends thru the tram . The distance to Disneyland was not that far from the entrance to Disney .  But in since Leo spotted us and he told us that he is able to get us a scooter right away where my dad does not have to walk from the hotel all the way to the guest services to get a scooter. He was great and so nice , he called it in . The scooter was so much more cheaper than Disneylands price and he can take it in the park , out of the park and back to the hotel . If it wasnâ€™t for leo my dad would have to strain his leg . The anahiem hotel had great service .

We were just coming to do the day parking instead of my dad  walking to Disneyland from Mickey ands friends thru the tram . The distance to Disneyland was not that far from the entrance to Disney .  But in since Leo spotted us and he told us that he is able to get us a scooter right away where my dad does not have to walk from the hotel all the way to the guest services to get a scooter. He was great and so nice , he called it in . The scooter was so much more cheaper than Disneylands price and he can take it in the park , out of the park and back to the hotel .

Desiree J,1,,2021-11-30,FAMILY,2021-11-29,5,Leo is a saint,"Leo was so sweet and caring . He spotted my dad coming out of of our car in the handicap parking with his cane . We were just coming to do the day parking instead of my dad  walking to Disneyland from Mickey ands friends thru the tram . The distance to Disneyland was not that far from the entrance to Disney .  But in since Leo spotted us and he told us that he is able to get us a scooter right away where my dad does not have to walk from the hotel all the way to the guest services to get a scooter. He was great and so nice , he called it in . The scooter was so much more cheaper than Disneylands price and he can take it in the park , out of the park and back to the hotel . If it wasnâ€™t for leo my dad would have to strain his leg . The anahiem hotel had great service .

But in since Leo spotted us and he told us that he is able to get us a scooter right away where my dad does not have to walk from the hotel all the way to the guest services to get a scooter. He was great and so nice , he called it in . The scooter was so much more cheaper than Disneylands price and he can take it in the park , out of the park and back to the hotel . If it wasnâ€™t for leo my dad would have to strain his leg . The anahiem hotel had great service .

We were just coming to do the day parking instead of my dad  walking to Disneyland from Mickey ands friends thru the tram . The distance to Disneyland was not that far from the entrance to Disney .  But in since Leo spotted us and he told us that he is able to get us a scooter right away where my dad does not have to walk from the hotel all the way to the guest services to get a scooter. He was great and so nice , he called it in . The scooter was so much more cheaper than Disneylands price and he can take it in the park , out of the park and back to the hotel .

Desiree J,1,,2021-11-30,FAMILY,2021-11-29,5,Leo is a saint,"Leo was so sweet and caring . He spotted my dad coming out of of our car in the handicap parking with his cane . We were just coming to do the day parking instead of my dad  walking to Disneyland from Mickey ands friends thru the tram . The distance to Disneyland was not that far from the entrance to Disney .  But in since Leo spotted us and he told us that he is able to get us a scooter right away where my dad does not have to walk from the hotel all the way to the guest services to get a scooter. He was great and so nice , he called it in . The scooter was so much more cheaper than Disneylands price and he can take it in the park , out of the park and back to the hotel . If it wasnâ€™t for leo my dad would have to strain his leg . The anahiem hotel had great service .

We were just coming to do the day parking instead of my dad  walking to Disneyland from Mickey ands friends thru the tram . The distance to Disneyland was not that far from the entrance to Disney .  But in since Leo spotted us and he told us that he is able to get us a scooter right away where my dad does not have to walk from the hotel all the way to the guest services to get a scooter. He was great and so nice , he called it in . The scooter was so much more cheaper than Disneylands price and he can take it in the park , out of the park and back to the hotel .

Desiree J,1,,2021-11-30,FAMILY,2021-11-29,5,Leo is a saint,"Leo was so sweet and caring . He spotted my dad coming out of of our car in the handicap parking with his cane . We were just coming to do the day parking instead of my dad  walking to Disneyland from Mickey ands friends thru the tram . The distance to Disneyland was not that far from the entrance to Disney .  But in since Leo spotted us and he told us that he is able to get us a scooter right away where my dad does not have to walk from the hotel all the way to the guest services to get a scooter. He was great and so nice , he called it in . The scooter was so much more cheaper than Disneylands price and he can take it in the park , out of the park and back to the hotel . If it wasnâ€™t for leo my dad would have to strain his leg . The anahiem hotel had great service .

Desiree J,1,,2021-11-30,FAMILY,2021-11-29,5,Leo is a saint,"Leo was so sweet and caring . He spotted my dad coming out of of our car in the handicap parking with his cane . We were just coming to do the day parking instead of my dad  walking to Disneyland from Mickey ands friends thru the tram . The distance to Disneyland was not that far from the entrance to Disney .  But in since Leo spotted us and he told us that he is able to get us a scooter right away where my dad does not have to walk from the hotel all the way to the guest services to get a scooter. He was great and so nice , he called it in . The scooter was so much more cheaper than Disneylands price and he can take it in the park , out of the park and back to the hotel . If it wasnâ€™t for leo my dad would have to strain his leg . The anahiem hotel had great service .

We were just coming to do the day parking instead of my dad  walking to Disneyland from Mickey ands friends thru the tram . The distance to Disneyland was not that far from the entrance to Disney .  But in since Leo spotted us and he told us that he is able to get us a scooter right away where my dad does not have to walk from the hotel all the way to the guest services to get a scooter. He was great and so nice , he called it in . The scooter was so much more cheaper than Disneylands price and he can take it in the park , out of the park and back to the hotel .

Desiree J,1,,2021-11-30,FAMILY,2021-11-29,5,Leo is a saint,"Leo was so sweet and caring . He spotted my dad coming out of of our car in the handicap parking with his cane . We were just coming to do the day parking instead of my dad  walking to Disneyland from Mickey ands friends thru the tram . The distance to Disneyland was not that far from the entrance to Disney .  But in since Leo spotted us and he told us that he is able to get us a scooter right away where my dad does not have to walk from the hotel all the way to the guest services to get a scooter. He was great and so nice , he called it in . The scooter was so much more cheaper than Disneylands price and he can take it in the park , out of the park and back to the hotel . If it wasnâ€™t for leo my dad would have to strain his leg . The anahiem hotel had great service .

But in since Leo spotted us and he told us that he is able to get us a scooter right away where my dad does not have to walk from the hotel all the way to the guest services to get a scooter. He was great and so nice , he called it in . The scooter was so much more cheaper than Disneylands price and he can take it in the park , out of the park and back to the hotel . If it wasnâ€™t for leo my dad would have to strain his leg . The anahiem hotel had great service .

We were just coming to do the day parking instead of my dad  walking to Disneyland from Mickey ands friends thru the tram . The distance to Disneyland was not that far from the entrance to Disney .  But in since Leo spotted us and he told us that he is able to get us a scooter right away where my dad does not have to walk from the hotel all the way to the guest services to get a scooter. He was great and so nice , he called it in . The scooter was so much more cheaper than Disneylands price and he can take it in the park , out of the park and back to the hotel .

Desiree J,1,,2021-11-30,FAMILY,2021-11-29,5,Leo is a saint,"Leo was so sweet and caring . He spotted my dad coming out of of our car in the handicap parking with his cane . We were just coming to do the day parking instead of my dad  walking to Disneyland from Mickey ands friends thru the tram . The distance to Disneyland was not that far from the entrance to Disney .  But in since Leo spotted us and he told us that he is able to get us a scooter right away where my dad does not have to walk from the hotel all the way to the guest services to get a scooter. He was great and so nice , he called it in . The scooter was so much more cheaper than Disneylands price and he can take it in the park , out of the park and back to the hotel . If it wasnâ€™t for leo my dad would have to strain his leg . The anahiem hotel had great service .

Desiree J,1,,2021-11-30,FAMILY,2021-11-29,5,Leo is a saint,"Leo was so sweet and caring . He spotted my dad coming out of of our car in the handicap parking with his cane . We were just coming to do the day parking instead of my dad  walking to Disneyland from Mickey ands friends thru the tram . The distance to Disneyland was not that far from the entrance to Disney .  But in since Leo spotted us and he told us that he is able to get us a scooter right away where my dad does not have to walk from the hotel all the way to the guest services to get a scooter. He was great and so nice , he called it in . The scooter was so much more cheaper than Disneylands price and he can take it in the park , out of the park and back to the hotel . If it wasnâ€™t for leo my dad would have to strain his leg . The anahiem hotel had great service .
